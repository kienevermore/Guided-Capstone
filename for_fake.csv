14-Feb-18,"We ve been covering the curious case of DOJ official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr What they did is so corrupt and underhanded! Nellie worked for the opposition research firm hired by the Democrats to get dirt on Trump (see below). Her husband would take whatever Nellie produced about Trump and hand it over to the FBI! Unreal! This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the  dossier.  Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it   which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn t appear to have told his supervisors. Some have suggested that the financial payments motivated Bruce Ohr to actively push the case.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON NELLIE OHR:This is a big deal even though we re sure the main stream media will ignore it. The connection between a now demoted DOJ official and Fusion GPS just got closer. His wife worked for the opposition research firm responsible for THE ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER!

15-Feb-18,"The heartbreaking story of two parents who put their leftist ideology before their own son The parents of GOP Senate candidate Kevin Nicholson have maxed out their campaign contributions to the Democrat he s challenging, CNN reported Monday.Each of Nicholson s parents gave $2,700 to Sen. Tammy Baldwin s (D-Wis.) campaign in December, the largest amount they can give during the Democratic primary.Nicholson s mother, Donna, has been documented as giving thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates over the years. However, this is the first gift either of his parents have made to Baldwin s campaign since Nicholson announced his own bid. My parents have a different worldview than I do, and it is not surprising that they would support a candidate like Tammy Baldwin who shares their perspective,  Nicholson said in a statement to CNN. I m a conservative today not because I was born one, but because of the experience I earned as a Marine in combat, my experience as a husband and father, my choice to be a Christian, the schools I chose to attend and the decision to pursue the career that I have,  he continued. Regardless of who may disagree with my life decisions, I would not trade these experiences for anything, and they will always guide my views as Wisconsin s next U.S. Senator. Nicholson announced in July that he would be running in the GOP primary for Baldwin s seat.He faced questions about his political views over his past position as president of the College Democrats of America and his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2000.However, Nicholson told Politico last year that he permanently changed parties after he served in Iraq in 2007. I knew what we were doing there,  he told Politico.  We were stabilizing that country. We made incredible amounts of progress. And what I was hearing back home was a complete and absolute lie, as politicians were running around calling it a failure.

16-Feb-18,"According to Fox News  A federal grand jury on Friday indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for allegedly interfering in the 2016 presidential election, in a case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that detailed a sophisticated plot to wage  information warfare  against the U.S.The Russian nationals are accused of setting a  strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election. The indictment   the first filed against Russian nationals as part of Mueller s probe   effectively returns focus to the meddling activities out of Russia in the run-up to the 2016 election, following a string of charges relating to the actions of Trump associates.Further, the DOJ made clear that the indictment does not allege that any of the interference changed the outcome of the presidential race. There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election,  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel probe, said at a Friday press conference.President Trump reacted to the indictments by seizing on Rosenstein s comment that the election results were not impacted by the Russians  activity. Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President,  Trump tweeted.  The results of the election were not impacted.

Bob Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) on Sunday warned special counsel Robert Mueller against issuing a report on his findings in the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election near the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.Speaking to radio host John Catsimatidis on New York radio station AM 970, Casey said he couldn t make any assumptions about where the Mueller investigation is going in light of indictments issued on Friday.

She s arrested BUT what happens next is what s so disturbing.A Saudi Arabian national faces hate crimes charges after allegedly spitting on several people at a Florida Walmart.Nuha Mohammed Al-Doaifi was arrested in Palm Bay after police responded to a 911 call, Florida Today reported Tuesday.The 21-year-old, who was with her 2-year-old son at the time, allegedly admitted to authorities she spat on several people because  Americans are pushing us around. The incident began, police said, when a woman approached Al-Doaifi when she appeared to be having difficulty entering the Walmart. All I was trying to do was tell her she was coming in through the out door,  Terry Rakowski told Florida Today.  She was just ramming (her cart) into the door. The 39-year-old then claims the woman spat in her face. She just spit all over me,  she said.Al-Doaifi then allegedly did the same thing to several others inside the Walmart. Her actions were directed at random people based on their ethnicity, and that s according to her own statement,  said a spokeswoman for the Palm Bay Police Department.BUT THIS IS WHAT S EVEN MORE DISTURBING:Don t bother trying to hit the link to the original source  Florida Today .

"Apr 10, 2015","Where was the media coverage when this black thug shot a white police officer in the face? It clearly doesn t fit their narrative which explains why this horrific incident took place on March 27, 2015 and the video is just being released today Massachusetts officials on Friday released video footage showing the near-fatal shooting of a Boston police officer last month by a man who was subsequently shot dead by other officers.The decision to release the footage comes amid protests in several major U.S. cities over a series of killings of civilians in recent months. The latest occurred last Saturday when a white officer in South Carolina was videotaped shooting an unarmed black man as he fled after a traffic stop. It is in everyone s best interest to share (this) information as soon as possible in order to tamp down speculation and rumors meant to inflame and not inform,  Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said at a news conference.The video shows six-year Boston Police Department veteran John Moynihan and two colleagues approaching a car stopped at about 6:40 p.m. on March 27 in Boston s Roxbury neighborhood.As Moynihan stands near the driver s door, a man identified by police as 41-year-old Angelo West jumps out of the vehicle, shoots Moynihan in the face and runs out of the camera frame as Moynihan falls to the ground.Authorities say West, who had a criminal record including prior gun charges, was shooting at police as he ran and that Moynihan s fellow officers returned fire, killing him.Moynihan, 34, is recovering after surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his neck.Local leaders at the news conference said that anger toward police over the incident was minimal. We need to be very aware that the work of police officers is indeed very dangerous,  said Rev. Mark Scott, of the Azusa Christian Community in Boston s Dorchester neighborhood.He called West s death  tragic,  but added that once someone pulls a gun on a police officer,  you don t leave the police any other option but to respond. The Suffolk District Attorney s office is investigating the shootings and has said it will release a full report on the incident later.Via: Reuters",BREAKING: WHY DID MASSACHUSETTS OFFICIALS WAIT SO LONG To Release This Video Showing Thug Shooting Police Officer In Face?

The people at the fundraiser had to pay a whopping $27,000 to hear this top secret info that the regular folk like you and me don t get to hear.

This official is saying that the we have evidence that Russia knew about the chemical weapon attack before it happened. This Associated Press report is interesting for a couple of reasons. Is the release of this information by a Senior U.S. Official an effort to embarrass Rex Tillerson or cause trouble for his trip to Russia?Tillerson will be in Russia in 36 hours so this will only add to the tension. Could this actually be the strategy of the Trump administration to give the upper hand to the U.S.?WASHINGTON (AP)   A senior U.S. official says the United States has concluded that Russia knew in advance of Syria s chemical weapons attack last week.The official says a Russian-operated drone flew over a hospital in Syria as victims of the attack were rushing to get treatment.Hours after the drone left, a Russian-made fighter jet bombed the hospital in what American officials believe was an attempt to cover up the usage of chemical weapons.Until Monday, U.S. officials had said they weren t sure if the drone was operated by Russia or Syria. The senior official said it still wasn t clear who was flying the jet that bombed the hospital.The official said the presence of the drone couldn t have been a coincidence, and that Russia must have known the chemical weapons attack was coming and that victims were seeking treatment.The official wasn t authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity.

"Apr 11, 2015","It s so refreshing to see these GOP candidates who are unwilling to allow the left to misrepresent their beliefs and create a distorted view of their positions on social issues.Having identified what they perceive as his Achilles heel, the liberal media continues to go at potential Republican presidential contender Ben Carson over gay issues.But Carson is clearly learning.The latest attempt at  gotcha jornalism  took place early Thursday when the retired neurosurgeon sat down with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who started off lecturing Carson about not being able to  duck issues  as president. As president of the United States, do you understand that you wouldn t be able to duck issues just because they make you uncomfortable or you don t do well on them?  Cuomo asked.  You understand that?(Gone are the days when such a condescending question would have resulted in a widespread media outcry of racism   after all, Carson is a Republican.)Taking the question at face value and asking what issues Cuomo had in mind, Carson was hit with  gay issues,  which Cuomo called  a very important issue to the development of the American culture. https://youtu.be/GE0O5AwP97sCarson responded with understated class, noting sexuality is a personal issue that he didn t find it nearly as interesting as Cuomo, who then tried to swing the conversation to gay marriage. Carson countered to say he would like to see the rights of Christians receive the same intensity, which prompted an interesting exchange. I would like to see as much emphasis on the rights of Christians as there is to some of the other groups,  Carson said.  I would like to see a much greater conservation about Christians and their rights. Why are we not talking about that? We are right now,  Cuomo replied.  The LGBT community gets far less legal protection, as you know No, not as I know,  Carson interjected. How do you not know that?  Cuomo asked.Carson then hit home on the crux of what defines the Democratic Party   identity politics. The important thing is for us as a nation to recognize that all citizens of the United States are protected by our Constitution,  he said.  We need to stop deciding that one group versus another is the flavor of the day.

The 2008 presidential campaign left deep and lasting scars on both the Clinton and the Obama camps, and they are still shockingly fresh. Michelle, now 52, never forgot how Hillary mocked her husband s message of  hope and change  at a campaign rally in Ohio during that campaign. The sky will open, the light will come down, celestial choirs will be singing, and everyone will know that we should do the right thing, and the world would be perfect,  Clinton said.Watch Hillary starting at the 45 second mark:Hillary was right; that certainly didn t happen and she has remained bitter for years that Senator Ted Kennedy, who had been her mentor in the Senate, did not support her presidential candidacy in 2008.A source in Hillary s inner circle told the author that Hillary, now 68, is running again for president out of vengeance for that loss. She needs to win.Obama is viewed by Hillary s circle of people as not having the same work ethic as Hillary who they see as having a long record of dedicated public service.Those Clinton acolytes also suggest that  Michelle has not done enough as first lady  and has failed to prioritize funding for some programs that subsequently lost their federal support.One such program was Save America s Treasures, a program that Hillary started to help preserve and protect historic sites, arts and published works and was lovingly carried on by Laura Bush, the next first lady.Michelle felt no such obligation to those treasures and let the program dissolve.Michelle s feelings towards Hillary were blatantly obvious when no couple dinners were scheduled at the Obama White House while Hillary was secretary of state and frequently meeting with the President.Michelle is very close to Jill Biden and Vice President Joe Biden. She was hoping that Biden would run against Hillary for the Democratic nomination and his win would take away the sweet taste of victory once again for Hillary.

"Apr 12, 2015","You won t believe this judge and how he berates a family that was terrorized in a home invasion. Can a three-year old help how she feels after this traumatic event?The reason Judge Olu Stevens of Louisville, Kentucky berated a family that was terrorized by two black home invaders   in court and on Facebook   will knock your socks off. In all my years, I don t think I ve ever seen such an egregious example of race-card abuse.The judge was  troubled  and  offended  by the fact that a three year victim was so traumatized by a violent home invasion, she is now fearful of black males.Jordan and Tommy Gray s 3-year old daughter was watching  SpongeBob  when two black armed men broke into her home and robbed her family at gunpoint   one of the perps pointing a gun in her father s face.Mom and dad honestly noted on the their victim impact statement that she is still afraid of black men 2 years later. Whenever we are running errands, if we come across a black male, she holds me tight and begs me to leave,  the mother said.  It has affected her friendships at school and our relationships with African-American friends. Tommy Gray also wrote that since the crime, his daughter had been terrified of black males and that probation was not sufficient punishment for Gregory Wallace, 27, who had pleaded guilty to robbery. If holding a little girl at gunpoint gets you probation, then our system is flawed,  Gray said.But when Wallace was brought up for sentencing Feb. 4 in Jefferson Circuit Court, it was the parents, not Wallace, who suffered Judge Olu Stevens  wrath. I am offended.   I am deeply offended that they would be victimized by an individual and express some kind of fear of all black men,  he said. This little girl certainly has been victimized, and she can t help the way she feels,  he said.  My exception is more with her parents and their accepting that kind of mentality and fostering those type of stereotypes. The Grays were not in court as Stevens denounced their statements and granted probation to Wallace, whom he said deserved the opportunity to redeem himself.But they did see when Stevens condemned their statements again, in a post on Facebook. Do three year olds form such generalized, stereotyped and racist opinions of others?  he wrote.  I think not. Perhaps the mother had attributed her own views to her child as a manner of sanitizing them. That a supposedly unbiased judge would ask such an ridiculously biased  leading question  does not speak well of him.It s obviously true that three year olds generally don t develop  generalized, stereotyped and racist opinions (as if you could call her fears those things)  on their own.  This young tot had a little help   She was traumatized when a couple of black home invaders terrorized her family. Is this judge stupid?The family is obviously unhappy that the ordeal has negatively impacted their daughter s view of blacks. How did he miss that? It s why they listed it it on the impact statement.Later Stevens said,  I wasn t criticizing the victims, I was criticizing a statement that I thought was a generalization against an entire race of people. He was criticizing the feelings of a three year old victim of a crime. Shame on him. #SMDHMeanwhile    Wallace and his accomplice, Marquis McAfee, both 27, were arrested about three weeks after the robbery. Both pleaded guilty and McAfee, who was on probation for a prior crime, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which he is serving.Assistant Commonwealth s Attorney Richard Elder objected to probation for Wallace, who pleaded guilty to a 20-year sentence, saying he was  guilty as hell  and  put a gun in that little girl s father s face.

It quickly became the number one trending hashtag.In honor of this awesome hashtag, here is a list of some of the best reasons why Americans are choosing to NOT vote for Hillary Clinton: America should not be run by crooks. She hasn t cared about the Middle Class in 70 years. She s starting now???? I support women! That includes the unborn in the womb. I won t support anyone that supports Planned Parenthood.

"Apr 14, 2015","Who needs family when you have a neighborhood mentor who can teach you the value of racism, communism and hate for America?In his 1995 book, Dreams from My Father, Barack Obama never discussed the identity of the mysterious  Frank  who had given him important advice on growing up black in what was described as a white racist world. We learned in 2008 that  Frank  was Frank Marshall Davis, a member of the Communist Party who was the subject of a 600-page FBI file. Still, the major media never asked Obama about this important relationship during his growing up years in Hawaii.Now, in an extraordinary development, video of Obama explicitly and openly identifying  Frank  as Frank Marshall Davis has suddenly surfaced on the Internet. The footage is said to have been recorded on September 20, 1995, with the program originally airing on Channel 37 Cambridge Municipal Television as an episode of the show,  The Author Series. It s not clear how many saw this program when it aired. For some reason, this  From the Vault  Barack Obama presentation was just recently posted on YouTube. In the video, Obama is introduced as a Harvard Law School student and President of the Harvard Law Review. He discusses  Frank  as Frank Marshall Davis at about 8:37 in the video.In his remarks, Obama never identifies Davis as a communist or even a leftist. But the remarks do reflect the significant influence that Davis had over his young life as he was growing up in Hawaii. Obama talks about how Davis  schools  him on the subject of race relations. The term implies a teacher-student relationship the two of them had, confirming what we had reported back in 2008, that Davis had functioned as Obama s  mentor. It s important to understand what Obama is saying here. Getting ready to read directly from his book, Dreams from My Father, Obama talks about the passages ending with  me having a conversation with a close friend of my maternal grandfather, a close friend of gramps, a black man from Kansas, named Frank, actually at the time a fairly well-known poet named Frank Marshall Davis, who had moved to Hawaii and lived there, and so I have a discussion with him about the kinds of frustrations I m having, and he sorts of schools me that I should get used to these frustrations Davis was indeed a black poet. His works included attacks on Christianity. One Davis poem referred to Christ irreverently as a  nigger.  Davis was himself an atheist.However, Davis was better known as a communist propagandist whose work for the Communist Party in Hawaii earned him surveillance by the FBI and placement on its  security index.  Davis was also a pornographer who engaged in bizarre sexual practices, even pedophilia.Needless to say, Obama s willingness to identify  Frank  as Davis before this audience raises questions as to why  Frank  wasn t identified by his full name Frank Marshall Davis in the book itself. Obama made references to  Frank  22 times throughout his book. Paul Kengor notes that Obama s audio version of Dreams from My Father omitted every reference to  Frank  that was in the book. Those omissions were clearly designed to keep people from asking questions about  Frank,  since Obama was considering a run for the presidency.Today, in 2015, discovering film of Obama identifying  Frank  as Davis is confirmation of the obvious. It doesn t make a lot of difference politically, since Obama is serving out his second term. But it could have made a difference seven years ago, in 2008, when we identified  Frank  as Davis, during Obama s campaign for his first term in office.The clip of Obama talking about Davis during his 1995 Cambridge presentation is important for other reasons, however.By his own admission, Obama was preoccupied with his own feelings and thoughts about race relations. He saw himself as an  angry young man  whose father was absent from his life. He said he was  without father figures around who might guide and steer my anger. That s significant because it s clear, from the passages he reads, that Davis became that father figure. Davis was indeed picked by his white grandfather to be a role model or father figure for the young Barack Obama.In the passages he read back in 1995, Obama discussed inviting some white friends to a black party and seeing them squirm.  They re trying to tap their foot to the beat and being extraordinarily friendly,  he said. They are trying to fit in but they are uncomfortable and they tell Obama they want to leave. Obama concluded,  What I have had to put up with every day of my life is something that they find so objectionable that they can t even put up with a day. This is like a revelation to Obama about the world of white racism. All of this he says  triggers  something in his head and he comprehends a  new map of the world.  He gets a sense of the anger and betrayal in society and even in his own family, where he is being raised by his white grandfather,  Gramps,  and white grandmother,  Toot.  This leads him to seek advice from  Frank.  Frank Marshall Davis then  sort of schools me that I should get used to these frustrations,  Obama says.The passages that he reads from the book before the Cambridge audience include a discussion of when his own white grandmother was accosted by a black panhandler. Davis told Obama that his grandmother was right to be scared and that  She understands that black people have reason to hate. In other words, Davis did not encourage Obama to pursue racial harmony or reconciliation. He told Obama that blacks have a reason, or right, to hate.Via:AIM.comh/t Weasel Zippers",BREAKING: VIDEO OF YOUNG OBAMA EMERGES Discussing Mentor Frank Marshall Davis’ Advice About Growing Up In A White Racist World
"Apr 14, 2016","It s a pity the millennials who support Bernie Sanders have never had to stand in a bread line. They ve never had to watch everything their parents have worked so hard for, be taken away by their government. They don t make the connection that there s more to life than a  free college.  The huge deductions these millennials see on their paychecks usually takes care of the naive attitude of the immature, idealistic crybabies. People who escaped the former Soviet Union and came to America are not feeling the Bern. Perhaps because they know exactly what it s like to live in the socialist utopia Bernie Sanders wants for America.The Atlantic reports:Why Soviet Refugees Aren t Buying Sanders s SocialismSAN FRANCISCO Janna Sundeyeva still remembers life in the Soviet Union, where stores in remote regions would lack meat for months at a time and toilet paper had to be snatched up quickly on the rare occasions it appeared.But the minor indignities paled in comparison to what happened to her grandfather: He had the chance to come to America in 1929, but he opted to stay, sensing an economic thaw. Seven years later, Sundeyeva says, he was arrested and never heard from again.Sundeyeva immigrated to San Francisco from Moldova in 1994, and now she and her husband run a Russian-language newspaper here called Kstati. Her Soviet experience colors how she sees U.S. politics to this day. I don t like big government,  Sundeyeva said. She made two circles with her thumbs and forefingers and pressed them against each other so they touched, like binoculars. This Venn diagram represents the interests of people and government, she said.  They don t have very much in common. Today, she s not a registered Republican, but like many of the readers of her newspaper, she said she s starting to lean toward supporting Donald Trump for president. The other self-styled outsider in the race, though, holds no appeal for her. The only Bern she and many other Russians here are feeling is the one in the banya.To Sundeyeva, left-wingers seem to yearn for a workers  revolution.  I would ask them: Have you ever lived under a revolution?  she said.  Do you know what it s like? When someone comes and takes your family member in the night? Interviews with more than a dozen immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the Bay Area suggest that some in the community are recoiling from Bernie Sanders and his leftist ideals. One hundred years after the Bolshevik Revolution swept Communists into power, some Russians in America say they can t believe a serious candidate in the United States is calling himself a socialist.Many of us can t believe it either, folks.Bernie s support among young people can be chalked up to ignorance. Millennials have no memory of the Soviet Union or the horrors people endured under socialism. They ve grown up in the most free country in the world and have never wanted for anything.

"Apr 14, 2017","During Obama s 8 years in office, he took a passive approach to the aggressive and unhinged North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. At the end of his time in office, Obama had to admit that his approach with them didn t work. President Trump however, is not Barack Obama, and has chosen a different course of action. He s not about to sit back and ignore North Korea s crazy dictator, as he continues to threaten the United States.CNS News   President Obama, speaking at his final news conference in Laos, said his approach to North Korea is  to not reward bad behavior,  but he also admitted that his approach isn t working because Pyongyang  has continued to engage in the development of their nuclear program. Obama spoke shortly before North Korea conducted its fifth   and largest   nuclear test.Obama said he is  deeply disturbed  by North Korea s continued flouting of  international obligations,  and he pointed to the defensive measures   the deployment of U.S. THADD missiles in South Korea   intended to protect the U.S. and its allies.North Korea upped its warmongering with Donald Trump today in a series of menacing boasts threatening to  ravage  US troops amid fears the two countries are heading for war.The secretive state vowed to  pulverize  US bases and South Korean capital Seoul if it was threatened by the US military, which is carrying out drills on the Korean peninsula. A US aircraft carrier group is steaming towards the region.It claimed it would  ruthlessly ravage  the US if Washington attacked. China warned the region could go to war  at any moment .The rhetoric comes after North Korea warned that President Donald Trump s  troublemaking  and  aggressive  tweets have pushed the world to the brink of thermo-nuclear war.Pyongyang s Vice Minister Han Song Ryol accused Trump of building up a  vicious cycle  of tensions and warned the US against provoking North Korea militarily. He said:  We will go to war if they choose. He added the country would continue developing its nuclear program and conduct its next nuclear test whenever its leaders see fit.In the past week Trump has shown his willingness to launch military strikes, with US missiles deployed in Syria and Afghanistan.In other developments today, as tensions heighten in the Korean peninsula:Pence plans to celebrate Easter with US and Korean troops on Sunday before talks on Monday with acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn. We re going to consult with the Republic of Korea on North Korea s efforts to advance its ballistic missile and its nuclear program,  a White House foreign policy adviser told reporters, previewing Pence s trip.Pence will land in Seoul the day after North Korea s biggest national day, the  Day of the Sun. The White House has contingency plans for Pence s trip should it coincide with a another North Korean nuclear test by its leader Kim Jong Un, the adviser said. Unfortunately, it s not a new surprise for us. He continues to develop this program, he continues to launch missiles into the Sea of Japan,  the adviser said. With the regime it s not a matter of if   it s when. We are well prepared to counter that,  the adviser said.U.S. officials have played down the prospect of any military strike against North Korea, which would likely provoke massive North Korean retaliation and huge casualties in Japan and South Korea and among U.S. forces in both countries.China, North Korea s sole major ally and neighbor, opposes its weapons program and has called for talks leading to a peaceful resolution and the denuclearization of the peninsula. Military force cannot resolve the issue,  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters in Beijing.  Amid tensions we will also find a kind of opportunity to return to talks. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also underscored fears about possible threats from North Korea, telling parliament in Tokyo that Pyongyang could have the capacity to deliver missiles equipped with sarin nerve gas.CIA director Mike Pompeo said North Korea was closer now than it had ever been to being able to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped intercontinental missile and increased its technical know-how with each new test.Experts do not believe North Korea has a deliverable long-range nuclear weapon, or intercontinental missiles.But that could change within the next few years, as experts say North Korea could have a viable nuclear warhead and a ballistic missile capable of hitting the US mainland during Trump s watch as president.Aerial photos taken Tuesday show continued activity at the Punggye-ri Nuclear site where US officials fear a nuclear device has been installed in a tunnel ahead of another test.And Han, referring to North Korea as the Democratic People s Republic of Korea, said Friday:  If the US comes with reckless military maneuvers then we will confront it with the DPRK s preemptive strike. We ve got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands, and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a U.S. preemptive strike. The message had been echoed in the days before, when North Korea said it would launch a  merciless retaliatory strike  against US military action.Pyongyang also recently launched a ballistic missile and some experts say it could conduct another nuclear test at virtually anytime.For entire story: Daily Mail ",N.

It s a rhetorical question of course UNION GROVE, Wis.   Pretend you re a Muslim. That s what a 10th grade World History writing assignment asks students to do at a Wisconsin high school.WISN talk radio host Vicki McKenna posted Union Grove High School teacher Beth Urban s email for a five-paragraph essay on Twitter.It reads: Pretend you are:1. Muslim male/female in U.S.2. Give 3 examples of what you do daily for your religion and any struggles you face.3.

The parent, who asked to remain anonymous, doesn t blame the teacher for the essay s instructions. I did not voice my concerns directly to the teacher because I do not blame the teacher. I believe this is a curriculum issue. The teachers are not using their own curriculum, the school boards/superintendents do generally,  according to the parent. I brought attention to it because I felt that it was inaccurate for World History. I would have no problem with this assignment if they were to pretend they were in the Middle East and practicing their religion. I first was bothered because it seems that if any Catholic issues are brought up attention is brought to the school and (the assignment) banned being a public school.

"Apr 15, 2016","Is there any question what Obama s priorities are in his final 8 1/2 months in office? His legacy will most certainly be that of the most divisive President (and First Lady) to ever occupy the White House. Every law enforcement officer in America should be concerned about his obsession with taking them down a few notches.President Obama is meeting with a group of music stars on Friday to discuss his push for criminal justice reform and his initiaitve dedicated to helping young men and boys of color.Rappers Busta Rhymes, Common, J. Cole, Wale, Ludacris and Chance the Rapper are all attending the meeting, according to a senior administration official.The meeting comes as Obama is trying to beef up support for the My Brother s Keeper Initiative, which is designed to help young African-Americans get an education, college degree and job training.Obama and his supporters launched a nonprofit group last May that will allow the president to continue the work once he leaves office.The president has also tried to keep momentum behind a bipartisan coalition looking to pass legislation in Congress that would reduce prison sentences for many non-violent drug offenders. Senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and My Brother s Keeper task force chairman Broderick Johnson also attended the meeting.War On Cops: President Obama says his  criminal justice reform    doublespeak for pardoning criminals and investigating cops   is gaining bipartisan support. New FBI crime data should stop the movement in its tracks.Last fall, we argued that Obama s war on police, prosecuted with the help of his Black Lives Matter goons, sparked a  national crime wave.   Violent criminals are getting the upper hand as the  Ferguson effect  takes hold in cities across the country,  we noted.  Less-aggressive policing has emboldened the bad guys, leading to a nationwide spike in murder. Officers fear violating softer new use-of-force and arrest policies, pushed on cities by the Obama Justice Department, will open them up to civil-rights prosecution. Many have backed off patrols and stops in dangerous urban areas as a result. The result: Year-over-year homicide rates are up 76% in Milwaukee; 60% in St. Louis; 56% in Baltimore; 44% in Washington, D.C.; 22% in New Orleans; 20% in Chicago; 20% in Kansas City; and 17% in Dallas. Single-digit rises have been seen in New York and other cities. Soon after, FBI Director James Comey indicated that spiking murder rates may be partly due to the  Ferguson effect    police reluctance to carry out their duties over fear of being investigated for abuse or discrimination, or shot by angry thugs in the line of duty.Police chiefs echoed his concerns, prompting the attorney general to gather major police chiefs and mayors together in Washington for a crime summit. It was supposed to be a closed meeting, no press allowed.But a Washington Post reporter snuck in and recorded Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel complaining that all the vitriol thrown at cops had put them in a  fetal  position. Obama s former chief of staff said they were backing off crime in gang-infested areas of his city.Obama pooh-poohed the city-by-city reports of climbing murder rates, arguing that there wasn t any aggregate data to show a national trend. But now we have the national data from the FBI. It confirms that the U.S. murder rate shot up 6.2% in the first half of 2015 from a year earlier. The spike reverses a three-year downtrend.Overall violent crime   murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault   rose almost 2%, in contrast to a nearly 5% drop in the comparable period of 2014. Violent crime rose in all but one of the nation s four regions, the FBI said, and all but two city groupings.If liberal pundits and politicians want to stop soaring crime rates, they should stop vilifying cops. And they should start speaking out against the Black Lives Matter race-mongers and their  criminal-justice reforming  patrons in the White House.

"Apr 16, 2016","The victim of the angry Bernie Sanders supporter has an amazing attitude. It s the civility many of us have come to expect from Trump supporters who ve been unjustly attacked by uncivil and in many cases, unlawful Bernie Sanders supporters. A politically-motivated vandal in Washington State admittedly vandalized a Trump supporter s car, slashing its tires and dumping rotten yogurt through its sun roof, according to a police report filed last Monday.The suspect, named in the report as one Riley M. Silva of Gig Harbour, Washington, confessed his crime to the police. Showing no sign of remorse, he claimed his victim was an  ignorant bigot  and that he  improved the community  by vandalizing the car. According to the report, the culprit became angry after noticing that the car sported a Donald Trump sticker.His full confession to the police, which was originally posted on the blog of lawyer and author Mike Cernovich, reads as follows:I on the 11th day of the 4th month of 2016 did maliciously attack a hate symbol protected by the first amendment. After disabling the vehicle and dumping rotten food into the interior I feel I have improved the community and supported our nation s values by stopping a promoter of hate speech. I do not wish to have ignorant bigots in my town and in a just world the person deserved what was received and the situation is made whole.As America is far from just, I expect the bigot will want to be made whole.

I do not expect the law to recognize damage to tools of hate or fascism.

"Apr 17, 2015","Dr. Gina Loudon is hands down one of our favorite conservative writers. She nails it with this piece about the truth behind the lies of the California drought I found it supremely ironic this week that two of the big stories were about a man-made lack of water in California, and a man lost in a vast sea off of Florida.Gov. Jerry  Moonbeam  Brown announced the dire circumstances, not from the Capitol in Sacramento, but from the dramatic backdrop of a mountaintop. His narrative held that there should be five feet of  snow pack,  but alas, there was none. Brown, and the radical Marxists, couched as  environmentalists  he represents, have convinced most Americans to hold two radically opposing views simultaneously. Ostensibly, California is in danger of being flooded by rising sea levels caused by global warming and melting polar ice caps, and it is also utterly out of water.There is no shortage of water. This is an environmentalist-created drought that is costing billions.I waver between utter disgust and admiration when I watch how the leftists sell these things, always with straight faces. Every major news outlet in America and many around the world swallowed the narrative like fish on a baited hook. They tell us there is no water, no snow to provide water for the summer, and the farmers are taking too much so people must suffer. There is an all-out war on grass, and no one is safe. Sorry, Shaggy, your  grass  is to blame as well.There is hand wringing in every club house as the boards are told they are coming for the rough grass, your fairways and greens are safe, for now. Evil rich guys in colorful knickers and almond farmers in overalls are the scourge of California. Off with their heads! Oh, and you can forget about the luxury of children playing on the lawn. If you want that, you breeders should move to flyover land! Don t you dare sneak and water the backyard after dark; Brown makes it easy for your neighbors to snitch on you. I m not making this up. They really have a state hotline for that.Those of us who pay attention know well the proverb,  Where there is no vision, the people perish.  The people who built California into the greatest agricultural producer in America gave us dams, canals, reservoirs and all kinds of conveyance of water. They harnessed the rivers that reach from the Pacific Northwest down well into Northern California and even draw water to the Golden State from the Colorado River. That was then. Nothing has changed since then, except political power.For the last several decades, the radical fringe has taken full control of California, and it hates people. Dennis Prager observed that statists love humanity but hate humans. Watch how they latch onto dreams of egalitarian states but begin the execution of their plans by marginalizing, isolating and then executing anyone who disagrees with them. They dine in the finest restaurants in San Francisco, the likes of Brown, Pelosi, Boxer and Feinstein, planning lawsuits to cut the flow of water to the farms of Central California and the people in Southern California, caring not a wit that 40,000 agricultural workers, mostly Hispanic, are unemployed.Just this week, in the middle of a human crisis, federal fish agents ordered the release of billions of gallons of water purportedly to save six fish. You read that right. Not to save six species of fish, but literally, six fish. Apparently, these special six stood their, err ground, and when 29 of their compadres rode the 10 billion gallon man-made wave to the ocean in March, they refused to go with the flow (sorry).You can t make this stuff up. But when you do, people actually believe it.So Obama administration agents want a second toilet flush to give these hard-headed steelheads a second nudge. The idea that nature itself may be holding the fish where they are is of no concern to statists who love telling both man and beast what they think is good for them. Sadly, this latest mind-boggling atrocity is getting very little media coverage. I found excellent coverage in the Manteca Bulletin. Why hasn t the Los Angeles Times reported on this?The current shortage is based primarily on the release of billions of gallons daily into the San Francisco Bay to sustain the bait fish known as the Delta smelt. This is a simple distribution issue; there is plenty of water.Prior to the statists taking over California, massive pumps were diverting water from rivers into the canal system (built before Brown and his ilk took control of the state). They have all but turned these pumps off to protect the fish from their Darwinian demise, and billions upon billions of gallons of fresh water is continuously dumped into the ocean.For the people-hating San Francisco cabal, cutting off water from the people is the real goal. They want fewer people to begin with, but the ultimate goal is control. Few environmentalists admit it publicly, but they want zero farming in the central valley, preferring to  allow  land to return to its prehistoric state. The cabal wants to control water so they can control people. Brown is just the messenger today. He is telling America that water access is a privilege, he has the power to pick winners and losers, and we have to just take it.If Brown decides tomorrow that he wants to withhold water from almond farmers, Americans will just have to accept it. Have you ever wondered why any business owner would give campaign donations to Marxist, business-hating politicians? Now you know why. They must give to buy protection. Business owners do not donate to Brown, Pelosi or Harry Reid because those politicians are good for business; they give to be sure they are not the next targets.The problem with all of this is that water is a limitless natural resource. Just ask the sailor who faced drowning daily or the people in the Midwest who were deluged this week. It is one thing to argue for conservation of animals, or even trees, or  green space,  but water? Water is a limitless natural resource. Not even the most self-important leftist believes he could make water go away, no matter how hard he tried. How did they convince us to accept this lie?They got us to buy the lie that water is scarce by telling it often enough and pounding it into generations of schoolchildren. Using federal law and acts of Congress, they forced people from water-soaked regions to accept low flush or what some call  two flush  toilets the same as desert-dwelling Californians. And we fell for it. At least the Democrats among us fell for it.Thus it is that Brown got to have his cake and eat it, too. He told Californians, and really all Americans and the world, that lack of water was not his fault for lacking the vision to feed the distribution system created by the real men who built California. He repeats that it is not the fault of the Marxists  Endangered Species Act that prefers hard-headed fish over people. The lack of water is the result of the lack of  snow pack,  which is the result of  climate change,  which is the result of greedy people being well, people. The Delta smelt and steelhead trout must live and we mere humans should all just die.Meanwhile, Jerry Brown is committed to spending $100 billion for trains, but he has made zero commitment to allowing water to flow to people instead of fish, and zero commitment to finding funding for his  twin tunnels  alternate solution. And why would he? We are cutting back our water use, ratting on our neighbors and accepting higher produce prices across America. The Marxists in San Francisco are toasting total victory. The farmers and country club board members are suing for peace.

Patrick Mahoney, of Church on the Hill in Washington, D.C. says that Christians in America cannot afford to be silent about what s going on.Speaking with Fox News on Friday, he discussed the persecution of Christians worldwide. Every five minutes, a Christian dies for their faith around the world. That s over 100,000  a year, he said.Mahoney started the #orangejumpsuit project to raise awareness, encouraging supporters to wear orange in a show of support for Christians being murdered for their faith. The color represents the jumpsuits worn by captives of ISIS, including the 20 Egyptian Copts beheaded in Libya in February.As Christians around the country embrace the campaign by wearing orange to church, Mahoney argued that it is not a strictly Christian movement. Americans need to realize we are seeing a genocide the likes we have not seen in a generation,  he said.And for women, forced into marriages and sold into sex trafficking operations, he said, it is  especially horrifying. Mahoney has been working with religious leaders of many faiths   including Muslims   to be more vocal in condemning the persecutions.He recently stood outside the White House personally wearing an orange jumpsuit bearing the name of Saeed Abedini, an American pastor jailed in Iran.Via: Biz Pac Review",WHY CHRISTIANS ARE ASKING THEIR FELLOW CHRISTIANS TO WEAR ORANGE TO CHURCH #orangejumpsuit

"Apr 18, 2017","More fake news pushing a leftist agenda If you read the USA Today report of Juan Manuel Montes being deported you might believe their headline:  First Protected Dreamer Deported Under Trump USA Today reported Tuesday that an illegal immigrant protected by Barack Obama s amnesty was deported in February after spending an evening with his girlfriend. However, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman told The Daily Caller that this story is false because Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez did not receive amnesty and was caught climbing over a border fence when he was detained.  Conservative TreehouseThe USA Today story said that Bojorquez, 23, was apprehended by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents while he was waiting for a car ride to pick him up.According to the article, he told the officers he left his wallet in his friend s car and, because he didn t have his ID or proof of his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, he was deported. Within three hours, he was back in Mexico, becoming the first undocumented immigrant with active DACA status deported by the Trump administration s stepped-up deportation policy,  the USA Today reporters wrote.The Trump administration has said it will continue honoring the over 750,000 illegal immigrants who receive DACA, but this incident, if accurate, would have been a departure from that policy. David Lapan, a DHS spokesman, told TheDC,  Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez was apprehended by the Calexico Station Border Patrol after illegally entering the U.S. by climbing over the fence in downtown Calexico. He was arrested by BP just minutes after he made his illegal entry and admitted under oath during the arrest interview that he had entered illegally. The spokesman added,  His DACA status expired in Aug. 2015 and he was notified at that time. In addition, he has a conviction for theft for which he received probation.  Daily CallerFrom USA Today: Federal agents ignored President Trump s pledge to protect from deportation undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children by sending a young man back to his native Mexico, the first such documented case, a USA TODAY examination of the new administration s immigration policies shows.After spending an evening with his girlfriend in Calexico, Calif., on Feb. 17, Juan Manuel Montes, 23, who has lived in the U.S. since age 9, grabbed a bite and was waiting for a ride when a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer approached and started asking questions.Montes was twice granted deportation protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program created by President Barack Obama and left intact by President Trump.Montes had left his wallet in a friend s car, so he couldn t produce his ID or proof of his DACA status and was told by agents he couldn t retrieve them. Within three hours, he was back in Mexico, becoming the first undocumented immigrant with active DACA status deported by the Trump administration s stepped-up deportation policy. Some people told me that they were going to deport me; others said nothing would happen,  Montes told USA TODAY in his aunt and uncle s home in western Mexico where he s been staying.  I thought that if I kept my nose clean nothing would happen.  He asked that the exact location of their home be withheld.Yet Trump declined to revoke the DACA protections Obama had granted to more than 750,000 undocumented immigrants, repeatedly saying he had a soft spot for these young people who are leading productive lives and have few, if any, ties to the countries of their birth. They shouldn t be very worried,  he told ABC News in January.  I do have a big heart. Even so, DACA enrollees are being targeted by immigration authorities.At least 10 are in federal custody, according to United We Dream, an advocacy organization made up of DACA enrollees and other young immigrants.The group s advocacy director, Greisa Martinez, who has DACA protection, said Montes  case is proof that people like herself are at risk despite what Trump said.For entire story: USA Today ",USA TODAY Caught Fabricating Story About Innocent “Dreamer” Being Deported…Here’s The Truth [VIDEO]

I had carefully planned it so that no one would get hurt, including me especially me. I thought about being 75 years old and watching the collapse of this country, and thinking that I had an idea that might have arrested the fall  and didn t do it. And I will tell you, completely honestly that I d rather die in the flight than live to be 80 years old and see this country fall. The wife of a Florida man who was arrested after he landed a one-man gyrocopter on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol building to protest money in politics insists that her husband is a patriot.While she says that she was not aware that her husband was going to attempt the illegal flight to Washington, Alena Hughes nonetheless believes that her husband is a  patriot  who  loves his country. I think he s a patriot and I m proud of him,  Mrs. Hughes told the media.Still, the whole incident has been  stressful,  Alena said.Doug Hughes, 61, a post office employee from Tampa Bay, Florida, told Capitol police that his gyrocopter mission was to highlight  money in politics  and he intended to deliver a letter to each member of Congress to urge them to initiate campaign finance reform.Since his arrest, the 61-year-old also claimed that the 2012 suicide of his son, John Joseph, also motivated him to make his protest flight.Hughes hired an attorney in Washington, but Mrs. Hughes also hired Paul Carr, her own attorney, just in case.Mrs. Hughes  attorney had an interesting take on Mr. Hughes  actions.  Tell me what restrictions mailmen have to deliver mail,  Carr said. The attorney went on saying,  He has a right to deliver mail. In fact, it s his obligation. Purportedly getting money out of politics has been a long-time goal of the left-wing.

"Apr 2, 2017"," Last week the Commerce Department released its third revision for fourth-quarter 2016 gross domestic product. The number came in at a paltry 2.1 percent, meaning that growth during President Obama s final year in office   the end of an  Error of Hope    landed with a big thud at just 1.6 percent.That low-water mark puts the Obama presidency in last place among all the post-World War II presidents when it comes to economic growth.There have been 13 post-WWII presidents, beginning with Harry Truman, who had the disadvantage of beginning in the aftermath of war in 1946, during which the economy contracted 11.6 percent   four times the contraction any other negative year since   and even he bested Obama s economic record!Truman, a moderate Democrat, also posted the two best years of growth on record: 1950 at 8.7 percent and 1951 at 8 percent, and there was no zero percent interest rate to gin up the economy back then.Thirteenth of 13 presidents is no mild distinction. Obama had eight full years to enact a growth policy, while many of his predecessors never had two complete terms. George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter had just four years each, Gerald Ford had less than three years and Richard Nixon had five.I m not the least bit surprised the Obama economy was a failure.

Unreal!Grandma Clinton told a group of New Hampshire Voters Monday  The first place I ever came for any political campaign was in 1991, when I was here campaigning for my husband, in October of 1991. In 1968, Hillary Clinton Worked On The Presidential Campaign Of Senator Eugene McCarthy In  New Hampshire That Winter.     Ms. Rodham had traveled to New Hampshire several times that winter to volunteer for Mr. McCarthy, the Minnesota Democrat challenging President Lyndon B. Johnson for the Democratic nomination. Mr. McCarthy s message   that the antiwar movement should operate within the system, not on the streets   appealed to Ms. Rodham. ..  Her political itinerary that year resembles a frenzied travelogue of youthful contradiction. She might have been the only 20-year-old in America who worked on the antiwar presidential campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy in New Hampshire that winter and for the hawkish Republican congressman Melvin Laird in Washington that summer.

"Apr 21, 2016","This is a powerful story of a courageous young woman who is fighting for the rights of women and children everywhere in America to feel safe in public bathrooms and locker rooms. It is a MUST read and SHARE story.A few months ago, Kaeley Triller, from the  Keep Locker Rooms Safe  organization and a victim of rape registered for a workshop called  The Story Workshop  at the Allende Center in Seattle. It was primarily aimed at helping survivors of sexual abuse find the purpose and weight in their fractured personal narratives, the conference promised to be intense but deeply healing.I don t know exactly what I expected. I was naively hopeful that I would get a few good writing tips that would enable me to beautify my past and approach it like one of Aesop s fables third-person fiction with a perfect little moral at the end of the story.That s not what happened. One of the pre-assignments was to write 700 words about a painful childhood memory. I was surprised at the one I chose. It wasn t a heavy hitter, so to speak. I wrote about a Polaroid picture I kept rediscovering in a shoebox at my parents  house, and my inability to figure out why looking at it made me want to rip it to shreds.I m about ten years old in the picture, with scraggly hair, pale skin, and a vacant expression. I m wearing my mom s oversized knit sweater and Oxford shoes my dad had bought me. In my hands is a piece of green felt I d cut into the shape of New York for a school report about a U.S. state. Coincidentally or not, New York is the place my abuser had recently moved. I think I wanted to be closer to him. Don t try to understand it. I still don t.My small group dissected the story with grace and insight that could only be offered by those who spoke the same horrific language of shame and rage and grief. I felt nothing as I spoke about it.  It is what it is,  I remember saying, committed to my ambivalence. My group leader brushed away a tear and said,  Kaeley, this story breaks my heart. Why do you hate the little girl in that picture so much?  I couldn t access her understanding or her empathy. I recognized the accuracy of her assessment, but I didn t know how to change it.Later that evening, one of the workshop presenters tasked us with a seemingly benign activity. We were instructed to play with crayons and miniature tubs of play dough on the tables in front of us. I hated these types of exercises. I thought they were such a waste of time. I reached for a purple crayon and reluctantly complied. I drew a picture of a flower and rolled a snake out of my play dough. And I burst into tears.The invitation to engage as a child had revealed my whole dilemma: I didn t hate the little girl in the photo. I hated her need. I hated her anonymity. I hated the visible proof that she loved her abuser. I hated that she didn t know any better, that it took her another ten years to figure out why she still slept with the light on and showered in her underwear and vigilantly lined the crack under the bathroom door with a beach towel and destroyed her teeth with gum she relentlessly chewed as a means of escaping the recollection of his breath on her face. I hated that he fooled her. He fooled everybody. He was really good. Wake up!  I wanted to scream at her.  Can t you see what s going on? Do something about it! It s the same desperate inclination I m fighting today. Everywhere I read in the news, there s talk of another school or gym or business that is boldly adopting  progressive  new locker room policies designed to create equal rights for people who identify as transgender. These policies allow transgender individuals to use the locker room consistent with the sex they identify as their own, regardless of anatomy.While some have proposed a third option for transgender people (single-occupancy restrooms and showers), this option has been largely struck down, and employees are prohibited from suggesting it, as it is considered discriminatory and emotionally damaging to a group of people who are working so hard to fit in. The solution? Anyone can use whatever restroom he or she wants without being questioned.I read these reports, and my heart starts to race. They can t be serious. Let me be clear: I am not saying that transgender people are predators. Not by a long shot. What I am saying is that there are countless deviant men in this world who will pretend to be transgender as a means of gaining access to the people they want to exploit, namely women and children. It already happens. Just Google Jason Pomares, Norwood Smith Burnes, or Taylor Buehler, for starters.While I feel a deep sense of empathy for what must be a very difficult situation for transgender people, at the beginning and end of the day, it is nothing short of negligent to instate policies that elevate the emotional comfort of a relative few over the physical safety of a large group of vulnerable people.Don t they know anything about predators? Don t they know the numbers? That out of every 100 rapes, only two rapists will spend so much as single day in jail while the other 98 walk free and hang out in our midst? Don t they know that predators are known to intentionally seek out places where many of their preferred targets gather in groups? That perpetrators are addicts so committed to their fantasies they ll stop at nothing to achieve them?Do they know that more than 99 percent of single-victim incidents are committed by males? That they are experts in rationalization who minimize their number of victims? Don t they know that insurance companies highlight locker rooms as a high-risk area for abuse that should be carefully monitored and protected?Don t they know that one out of every four little girls will be sexually abused during childhood, and that s without giving predators free access to them while they shower? Don t they know that, for women who have experienced sexual trauma, finding the courage to use a locker room at all is a freaking badge of honor? That many of these women view life through a kaleidoscope of shame and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, dissociation, poor body image, eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, difficulty with intimacy, and worse?Why would people knowingly invite further exploitation by creating policies with no safeguards in place to protect them from injury? With zero screening options to ensure that biological males who enter locker rooms actually identify as female, how could a woman be sure the person staring at her wasn t exploiting her? Why is it okay to make her wonder? Wake up!  I want to scream.  Can t you see what s going on? Do something about it! Despite the many reports of sexual abuse and assault that exist in our world, there s an even larger number of victims who never tell about it. The reason? They re afraid no one will believe them. Even worse, they re terrified of a reality they already innately know to be true: even if people did know, they wouldn t do anything to help. They re not worth protecting. Even silence feels better than that.There s no way to make everyone happy in the situation of transgender locker room use. So the priority ought to be finding a way to keep everyone safe. I d much rather risk hurting a smaller number of people s feelings by asking transgender people to use a single-occupancy restroom that still offers safety than risk jeopardizing the safety of thousands of women and kids with a policy that gives would-be predators a free pass.Is it ironic to no one that being  progressive  actually sets women s lib back about a century? What of my right to do my darndest to insist that the first time my daughter sees the adult male form it will be because she s chosen it, not because it s forced upon her? What of our emotional and physical rights? Unless and until you ve lined a bathroom door with a towel for protection, you can t tell me the risk isn t there.For me, healing looks like staring at the little girl in a Polaroid photo and validating her need to be seen, heard, and protected instead of hating it. It looks like telling my story, even the parts I can never make pretty, in hopes it will help break the anonymity of survivors and create a sense of responsibility in others to act.I still battle my powerlessness to do anything that feels substantial to affect change, but the good Lord didn t bring me out of Egypt and set my feet upon a rock so I could stand idly by in the face of danger. So even if a little article or Facebook post doesn t ultimately change the world, it s better than silent resignation to negligence and harm. I feel a sense of urgency to invite people to consider the not-so-hidden dangers of these policies before more and more of them get cemented into place. Once that happens, the only way they ll change is when innocent people get hurt.Even if there aren t hundreds of abusers rushing into locker rooms by the dozens, the question I keep asking myself is,  What if just one little girl gets hurt by this? Would that be enough to make people reconsider it? And what if that little girl was me?  It s a question I really don t want to ask. But God s grace has enabled me to value the face in the photo enough to realize that I have to. And even if I don t like the answer, at least I wasn t silent.Author  Kaeley Triller Via: The Federalist",POWERFUL: A RAPE SURVIVOR EXPLAINS Why Men Should Never Be Allowed In Women’s Bathrooms And Locker Rooms
"Apr 21, 2017","Americans were stunned when they were told the police officers were allegedly told to  stand down  and allow violent Antifa and Democrat rioters to attack students who came to hear schedule speaker and gay conservative Milo Yiannopolous at Berkeley College in February. It turns out that the mayor who was accused of telling the police to stand down may have had a motive for allowing conservatives to be threatened and physically harmed. Here s the description of BAMN from their Facebook page: BAMN   Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means NecessaryWait, WHAT!?

BAMN is perhaps best known, however, for a 2016 incident in which they showed up to a rally held by the white-nationalist Traditionalist Workers Party outside the California state capitol building in Sacramento. The militant group was confrontational with the white-nationalists within minutes of arrival, and ten people were stabbed and hospitalized in a bloody fight. Police have verified through videos taken by members of the group, news organizations, and bystanders, that BAMN initiated the violence. Falarco was caught on camera at the event repeatedly punching a man in the stomach and throwing him to the ground.Arreguin, a far-left liberal, made headlines in February for his tweets prior to BAMN organizing a riot to prevent right-wing political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking at the city s University of California campus. Using speech to silence marginalized communities and promote bigotry is unacceptable. Hate speech isn t welcome in our community,  Arreguin had tweeted.The mayor also referred to Yiannopoulos as a  white supremacist,  and was forced to issue an  apology. I consider much of what Mr. Yiannopoulos says to be hateful. But I regret and apologize for the white national label,  Arreguin tweeted.Hours after his tweet, supporters of President Donald Trump who hoped to listen to Yiannopoulos speak were under a violent attack. People were assaulted with pipes, a generator-powered spotlight was firebombed, and looters destroyed several businesses in the area including a Starbucks.The rioters smashed windows, spray painted violent messages all over the area   including  Kill Trump    and began committing arsons. It was estimated that the rioters caused $100,000 in damage to the MLK Student Union, and $400,000 to $500,000 in damage to the area surrounding the university.It was immediately alleged that the mayor had ordered the police to stand down and allow the violence and destruction.Arreguin denied the accusations, saying that the police strategy was ordered by the department, not him.  They did an excellent job in preventing further risk to safety,  he added.It was alleged by journalist and author Mike Cernovich, who broke the Susan Rice scandal as well as impending Syria strikes, that the FBI was investigating Arreguin role in the stand down.Civil Rights section of FBI has opened an investigation into mayor @JesseArreguin, for inciting riots and ordering to police to stand down. pic.twitter.com/uy5EbgcvSm  Mike Cernovich   (@Cernovich) February 2, 2017Last weekend Antifa showed up to shut down the free speech of Trump supporters who were rallying in Berkeley, CA and were surprised by the number of pro-Trump patriots who weren t going to sit back and allow themselves to be beaten.Watch these two stunning interviews, where police officers almost admit to this liberal reporter that they ve been told to stand down:I tell a police officer I've been seeing people get beat up all day and they haven't been around.

"Apr 22, 2015","Adios America Census: Record 51 million immigrants in 8 years, will account for 82% of U.S. growthWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker disrupted the debate this week when he said that legal immigration also needs to be reformed to make sure Americans don t suffer by losing jobs to new citizens.But even more, the CIS report said that the surge in mostly legal immigrants will have a huge impact on the nation and taxpayers. These numbers have important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment,  said Steven Camarota, the center s director of research.  They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants. Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers. Those numbers are likely to shake up Washington s political debate over the 12 million illegals in America, the expected 70,000 expected to pour over the border this year and the 4.4 million legal immigrants on a State Department waiting list who have relatives or jobs in the U.S.A key senator steering the immigration debate, Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions, has warned that higher numbers of immigrants will hurt the middle class. In a letter to the New York Times Saturday, he wrote,  It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs? On Friday, key business leaders including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a group associated with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg plan to pitch for more immigration. Their schedule is below.The numbers, as seen in the highlights below, will also raise concerns that Washington is giving the keys to the nation to new immigrants:  The immigrant population will grow four times faster than the native born population, reaching 15.8 percent, or 57 million, of the nation s population in 2030, 17.1 percent, or 65 million, in 2040, and 18.8 percent, or 78 million, in 2060.  Net immigration this year will be 1.24 million; green cards about 1.1 million.  Immigrants and their descendants  will account for the overwhelming share of population growth,  said the Center in projecting growth. They will account for 75.5 percent from 2010-2050 and 82 percent from 2010-2060.  Census Bureau projects that in 2023 the nation s immigrant population, legal and illegal, will reach 14.8 percent of the total U.S. population, the highest share ever recorded.Via: Washington Examiner",OBAMA’S FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION: Census Record Shows In 8 Years You Won’t Recognize This Country
"Apr 22, 2016","Felons get to vote all of a sudden in Virginia because the governor is a buddy of the Clinton s .dirty politics seems to follow the Clintons. There s a long history of corruption between McAuliffe and Bill Clinton. Once again, they re just helping each other out  On Friday Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-VA) gave 200,000 felons the right to vote. The list includes rapists and murderers. But, it s OK. It will help Hillary Clinton in the fall. The Washington Post reported:Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) will make all ex-felons in Virginia eligible to vote in the upcoming presidential election, part of a years-long effort to restore full voting rights to former convicts.McAuliffe s announcement in Richmond on Friday will allow an estimated 180,000 to 210,000 former felons who are not in prison or on probation or parole to register to vote this year in Virginia, a battleground state, according to a coalition of civil rights groups that had pushed for the restoration of voting rights.Advocates said McAuliffe s move was the biggest-ever single action taken to restore voting rights in this country. It is a historic day for democracy in Virginia and across our nation,  said Tram Nguyen, co-executive director of the New Virginia Majority, a progressive activist group.  The disenfranchisement of people who have served their sentences was an outdated, discriminatory vestige of our nation s Jim Crow past. Many Republicans viewed McAuliffe s action as a blatant favor to his longtime friend Hillary Clinton, for whom he and his wife recently raised $2 million at their McLean home. It is hard to describe how transparent the Governor s motives are,  House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) said in a statement.  The singular purpose of Terry McAuliffe s governorship is to elect Hillary Clinton President of the United States. This office has always been a stepping stone to a job in Hillary Clinton s cabinet.Republicans were particularly outraged that the policy doesn t take into account the violence of the crime, whether the person committed serial crimes, whether they ve committed crimes since completing their sentence or whether they ve paid their victims back for medical bills.Via: WaPo","HELPING HILLARY: What The Virginia Governor Just Did Will Help 200,000 More People Vote For Hillary"
"Apr 22, 2017","Bruce Springsteen aka  The Boss  is showing all of his fans just how out of touch he is with his latest song. He s been a fervent anti-Trump guy and has been very outspoken against President Donald Trump. His new protest song refers to Trump as a  con man . What a way to disrespect the leader of our nation! has Bruce Springsteen employed thousands of Americans? It s interesting that Trump just delivered one of the best ever speeches to the builders union. Please watch the video provided below of what a real working man does for his crew. It s an awesome speech that totally discounts everything Springsteen is trying to say to bash Trump. Shame on him!The 67-year-old rocker released his and Joe Grushecky s anti-Trump song, called  That s What Makes Us Great,  and it is a direct comment on the president and his administration, according to Pitchfork.Springsteen s part of the song goes as follows: Don t tell me a lieAnd sell it as a factI ve been down that road beforeAnd I ain t going back.And don t you brag to meThat you never read a bookI never put my faithIn a con man and his crooks.  During an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Gushecky talked about writing the song in January after Trump was sworn-in as president I had this song, and Bruce and I had been talking,  Grushecky said.  I sent it to him and he liked it. I said,  What do you think about singing on it?  He gave it the Bruce treatment. In February, Springsteen said he was an  embarrassed  American during a concert in Australia. On the same tour he attacked Trump s first travel ban as  un-American. Tonight we want to add our voice to the thousands of Americans who are protesting at airports around our country the Muslim ban and the detention of foreign nationals and refugees,  Springsteen told the crowd.  America is a nation of immigrants. This is fundamentally un-American. What a bunch of bull! Springsteen has lost his roots and his sense of the working man. If he cared to know anything about President Trump then he would know Trump s bringing back American jobs. He s working hard to get the steel industry up and running again. He just held a  Buy American, Hire American  event promoting keeping jobs in America. What s better than a president who s a builder speaking to builders and construction workers. In President Trump s speech he calls out people by name pretty great! He knows business and building. We re in good hands America!TRANSCRIPT: I want to thank Sean McGarvey and the entire governing board of presidents for honoring me with this great invitation. And I love that it s in Washington, because I don t have to travel very far. Worked out pretty well, I have to tell you. Five minutes.Sean took part in one of our very first meetings at the White House  - he mentioned it   and I promise you that America s labor leaders will always find an open door with Donald Trump. Always. (Applause.) Just look at the amazing talent assembled here. We have ironworkers, insulators   (applause)   never changes, does it, with the ironworkers? Let s hear it. Laborers. (Applause.) Painters. (Applause.) Fitters. (Applause.) Plumbers. (Applause.) Operators   they re operators, all right, I ll tell you that. (Laughter.) Electricians. (Applause.) Not that good. Where s my Local 3? Where s Local 3? That wasn t that good, the electricians   well, they became so rich they don t have to   (laughter)   let s do that again. Electricians. (Applause.) That s better.Bricklayers. (Applause.) Boilermakers. (Applause.) Elevator constructors. (Applause.) Good job. Sheet-metal workers. (Applause.) Roofers. (Applause.) Plasterers   plaster, well, yeah, that s   not using as much plaster as we used to, fellas, right? No matter how you cut it. Sorry about that. I m not sure I can do much   we brought back the coalminers. I m not so sure about the plasterers. We ll do the best we can, okay? We re going to do the best we can. How about the cement masons. (Applause.) And, of course, our wonderful Teamsters. (Applause.) Oh, that wasn t very good, James.But really, you re the backbone of America. With the talent in this room, we could build any city at any time, and we can build it better than anyone. (Applause.) But we re going to do even better than that. Together, we are going to rebuild our nation. (Applause.)You re the keepers of the great trades and traditions that built our country from the New York skyline to the Golden Gate Bridge. You represent the workers whose hands, skills, and dreams will build the great landmarks of our future. Every day, your members live out what I call the American Creed. They re on the job before dawn and after dusk, and they never quit until that job is done. You know that. True. True. (Applause.)We saw this grit on display when the construction trades helped rebuild New York City after 9/11. (Applause.) That was a terrible time   we were all there   that was a terrible time in this country s history. Worst attack in the history of our country. Worse than Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor they were attacking military. Here they were attacking civilians. Worst attack. And I saw what happened. Within a very short period of time, we were back rebuilding, and rebuild you did. And I really congratulate   that took a lot of courage and a lot of strength. Thank you. (Applause.)The fact is you take pride in every part of your work   every joist, bolt, and rivet. You re not only builders, but you re artisans, very talented people. A lot of people don t understand, you re very talented people   enriching our cities and landscapes with works of great beauty. And just as you take pride in your work, our nation takes great, great pride in you, believe me. And it s time that we give you the level playing field you deserve. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.Washington and Wall Street have done very, very well for themselves.Now it s your turn.And you re going to be also sharing the wealth. (Applause.) And you know, for many years, we ve been taken advantage of by other countries. All over the world they took advantage of us. We had leaders that didn t have a clue or worse. That s not going to happen anymore, folks. That s not going to happen anymore. And you see what s going on right now. In fact, the trade deficit went way down   just announced before I got on stage. And I will tell you, we re going to have a whole different set of values when it comes to representing our country.That I can tell you right now. (Applause.)This election was all about returning power to the people. I ve spent my life working side-by-side with American builders, and now you have a builder as your President. (Applause.) One of my first acts as President was to stop one of the great sellouts of the American worker   I immediately withdrew the United States from the disaster   this would have been a disaster   this would have been another NAFTA, which, by the way, is a disaster. I took you out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (Applause.) Thank you. That one wasn t even close. And you know it and I know it, everybody knows it.Next, I cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. (Applause.) And it s looking like that s going to have about 42,000 jobs involved, those two jobs. That some number of great people. That s a big, big, beautiful   lot of people. And Sean actually, and a whole group joined me in the Oval Office when we approved the Keystone permit.And I joked that day   I said, can you imagine the head of this big Canadian company, in this case, they build pipelines   and they failed. Didn t work. They paid millions and millions and hundreds of millions of dollars to consultants and lawyers, and they failed. And it was over. And then one day Trump wins, and a few days later they get a knock on the door   sir, the Keystone pipeline was just approved.Can you imagine? I want to see the expression on his face. And he s a nice guy. He actually   they came to the office. (Applause.) Because I did say you have to use American steel, you have to fabricate it here. Now, they had already bought 60-70 percent of it. So you can t be too wild, right? But I was signing the order, and I said, where did they buy this steel? I didn t like the answer. I said, who fabricated the steel? I didn t like the answer. I said, from now on we re going to put a clause   got to be made in America. We want American steel, made in America. (Applause.) Right on the box. 100 percent, right? (Applause.)And you ll be hearing more about this in the very near future. But as time goes by, let s say, over the next seven and three-quarters years   meaning eight years   (laughter.)We believe in two simple rules: Buy American, and Hire American. That s what it s going to be. (Applause.) And that s not just a slogan, it s a promise. Believe me, that s a promise. (Applause.)The era of economic surrender has come to an end. It s come to an end. We have surrendered as a country to outside interests. The era of economic victory for our country has just begun. You will see. No longer will we listen to those failed consultants who ve made one wrong prediction after another   delivering nothing but soaring trade deficits and a big, fat, shrinking workforce.For decades now, we ve watched as our factories have shuttered   almost 70,000 factories   our jobs have been stolen, and blue collar wages have declined. We ve seen the economic pain inflicted on our fellow Americans in Pittsburgh and Detroit and Baltimore. We didn t just offshore our jobs, we offshored a big, big part of the American Dream.We enriched foreign countries at the expense of our own country, the great United States of America. But those days are over. (Applause.) I m not   and I don t want to be   the President of the world. I m the President of the United States. And from now on, it s going to be America First. (Applause.)We re going to bring back our jobs   and, yes, we re going to bring back the American Dream. As I traveled the nation, I heard the pleas of the forgotten men and women of our country   the people who work hard and play by the rules, but who don t have a voice. Together, we are their voice, and they will never, ever be forgotten again. That I can tell you. (Applause.)I don t know if you saw, but if you watch the Democrats now, the anger   the anger and hatred, and they re trying to figure out where did all these people came that voted for Donald Trump? Remember they said   because the Electoral College is a very, very hard, they say, almost impossible for a Republican to win. The odds are stacked. And they would say there s no way to 270   you need 270   there s no way to 270. I heard that so much for a year   I kept saying, maybe I shouldn t be running. You know, Sean, I said, maybe I shouldn t run because there s no way. The people are telling me   the same people that say all of the bad stuff, they re saying, there s no way to 270. But there was a way to 306.But wasn t that an exciting one? Places that nobody entered   Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan. They go, what? Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. They came out of the blue, and we didn t even need them. And we love those two states   because we won the state of Pennsylvania, and we won Ohio, and Iowa, and North Carolina, and South Carolina, and Florida, and so many others. We ran the coast. And if you don t run it, you can t win. Huge disadvantage, Electoral College. It s very, very tough. They say almost impossible for a Republican to win. But I had the support of, I would say, I would say almost everybody in this room.We had tremendous   we had tremendous support. Oh, we did. We had tremendous support. (Applause.) We had tremendous support. And I ll tell you, we really had the support of the workers. We had tremendous support of the workers. But would you like to make a change, folks? Would you like to make a change? Because if anybody wants to make a change, you won t be having so many jobs. That I can tell you. Your jobs will be   it will be a whole different story. Because in the last decade, you lost over 750,000   think of this   750,000 construction jobs. Real wages in the construction sector have fallen more than 15 percent since the 1970s. We rank 39th in the world for construction permitting. And approvals for infrastructure projects can take up to 10 years.Since taking office, I ve signed one action after another to eliminate job-killing regulations that stand in the way. I had a chart   is that chart around here someplace? Do you have that? I have to show this chart to you because it s amazing, actually.This is   if you want to build a highway in the United States, these are some of the permits that you need. It s a process that can take way over 10 years. And it just never happens. Then at the end of the period they vote against it. And we re getting rid of many of these regulations. (Applause.) You have to go through 17 agencies, many permits in each agency.In February alone, we added almost 60,000 new construction jobs in the country. I ordered expedited environmental reviews for infrastructure, environmental and energy projects all across the country. No longer will you have to wait year after year for approvals that never come.I also took historic action to lift the restrictions on American energy production and to put our miners, who have been treated horribly, back to work. (Applause.) They re great people.Consumer confidence is at its highest level in more than a decade. You ve seen all of the charts, all of the studies. The National Association of Manufacturers just the other day reported the most optimism in the entire history of its survey   which is a old survey   93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future. It was almost 27 percent lower than that just a few months ago.The Home Builders Confidence Index is at its highest level in 12 years. And now in breaking news, it was just reported today, the monthly U.S. trade deficit declined by 10 percent   for a reason. Not by accident, believe me. It was for a reason.We re also going to protect your jobs by protecting our borders. My administration is   just a matter of weeks, literally, a short period of time   has brought record reductions to illegal immigration. Record reductions. (Applause.) Down 61 percent since inauguration. General Kelly is doing a fantastic job. And we ll crack down on visa abuses that undermine the American worker. And we re doing that right now. (Applause.)These, and so many other great achievements, have defined our first 10 weeks in office. We ve done so much for the worker. Done so much for the military. We ve done so much for the police officers, our men in blue and women in blue who are not treated fairly. We re fighting for workers of all backgrounds and from all walks of life.But to achieve true progress, we must remember our legacy. We re the nation that built the tallest skyscrapers on what was once the Hudson River, and put neon lights of Las Vegas in the middle of the desert. But if government continues to punish America s builders, then we will not be that nation any longer.I m calling on all Americans   Democrat, Republican, independent   to come together and take part in the great rebuilding of our country. (Applause.)That is why, in my address to Congress, I called on lawmakers to pass legislation that produces a $1-trillion investment in the infrastructure of our country. And we need it. (Applause.) With your help, we can rebuild our country s bridges, airports, seaports, and water systems. We will streamline the process to get approvals quickly, so that long-delayed projects can finally move ahead. And with lower taxes on America s middle class and businesses, we will see a new surge of economic growth and development.All of you have come to the nation s capital to call members of the House and Senate to action. You ve also called your President to action. When you see them, you can tell Congress that America s building trades and its President are very much united. (Applause.)Together, we are ready to break new ground. We will build in the spirit of one of the great projects in our nation s history   an enduring symbol of American strength. The Empire State Building was forged in the Great Depression, and provided jobs for more than 3,000 workers. We ve all seen the pictures   rugged workers perched dozens and dozens of stories up in the air. Workers like these moved almost 60,000 tons of steel, installed 200,000 cubic feet of stone, and laid 10 million bricks to build that American icon. And they did the job in a record time   13 months. Hard to believe. Think of that   the Empire State Building built in 13 months, during the Depression. Nowadays, you couldn t even get a building permit or approval in that amount of time.When the workers had secured the last piece of steel in that amazing and beautiful structure, they marked the moment   as we still do today   with what is called a  topping out  ceremony: 1.050 feet above the streets of New York City, they hoisted a beautiful and great American flag. (Applause.)AUDIENCE MEMBER: The ironworkers!THE PRESIDENT: They did a good job. They did a good   those ironworkers, you better believe it.It was an American flag that represented American projects   the big, bold, and daring dream of one man, and then one city, and then finally, one people. That banner marked our nation s proud climb to the top of the world. Our people endured through the hardships of Depression and the battles of World War II, and they emerged from these trials stronger and more united than ever before. Now, we must again summon that same national greatness to meet the challenges of our time.Only miles from the halls of Congress and the newsrooms of Washington, you will find once-thriving cities marred by empty lots and once-booming industrial towns that have become rusted and are in total disrepair. Standing before me today, in this very hall, are the men and women who, if given the chance, can transform these communities. You are the citizens who can rebuild our cities, revive our industries, and renew our beloved country. And I know you will stop at nothing to get the job done. (Applause.)For the rest of their lives, everyone who worked on the Empire State Building knew when they looked up at that great New York skyline that they had lifted the Stars and Stripes atop the tallest flagpole on Earth, and that somewhere high above the city streets, their place in history was carved into beams of steel.In the future, when we become   the trials   and we are   trials of our times   we too will emerge stronger and more united than ever before. It s happening, you watch. When we rise above the cynics and critics who live only to defend the status quo, and to defend themselves from failure, then we, too, will construct a lasting monument to national greatness.In this future, our nation s workers and craftsmen will look way out at the vast open landscape, and they will build new bridges and new schools and new landmarks, and they will proudly raise up for all to see our bright and beautiful American flag. And when we see that flag, we will remember that we all share one American home, one American heart, and one American destiny.May God bless our nation s builders. May God bless our nation s workers. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)",BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN Releases Anti-Trump Song Calling The President A “Con Man”
"Apr 23, 2015","What difference does it make? Well, it makes lots of difference to the IRS. The Clinton charities got called on the carpet for  misfiling  tax returns up to 5 years old. Oops!Hillary Clinton s family s charities are refiling at least five years of tax returns after an investigation revealed they had misreported tens of millions of dollars in donations from governments. The charities  errors generally took the form of under-reporting or over-reporting donations from foreign governments, or in other instances, omitted to break out government donations entirely when reporting revenue, the charities confirmed to Reuters, which uncovered the mistakes. Following the discovery, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative said they will be refiling multiple annual tax returns and may audit returns extending as far back as 15 years in case there have been other errors. The foundation and its donors have been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. Republican critics say the foundation makes Clinton, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, vulnerable to undue influence. Her campaign team calls these claims  absurd conspiracy theories .

Is the NBA still a professional sports organization, or have they morphed into a radical social change group? If the answer is the latter, you won t see me pay another dime to sit in the stands of another NBA game. I don t think I m alone in that thinking either. Putting social issues before the safety and well-being of women and children is misguided and dangerous. Click HERE to comment on NBA Commissioner Adam Silver s Facebook page. Commissioner Adam Silver believes the NBA has been  crystal clear  that the 2017 All-Star Game only stays in Charlotte if a North Carolina law goes.Political and business leaders he s spoken with in the state believe it will, so he s holding off for now on setting any deadlines for when the NBA might act.Silver said last week that the law that limits anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay and transgender people was  problematic  for the league, but he believed dialogue was more useful than ultimatums at this point, so has continued discussions with North Carolina officials. The sense was that if the NBA could give us some time, they in the community of North Carolina were optimistic they would see a change in the law. They weren t guaranteeing it and I think which was why my response was the event still is 10 months from now, we don t need to make a decision yet,  Silver said Thursday during a meeting of Associated Press Sports Editors. We ve been, I think, crystal clear that we believe a change in the law is necessary for us to play in the kind of environment that we think is appropriate for a celebratory NBA event, but that we did have some time and that if the view of the people who were allied with us in terms of a change, if their view, the people on the ground in North Carolina, was that the situation would best be served by us not setting a deadline, we would not set a deadline at this time. The North Carolina law directs transgender people to use public toilets corresponding to the sex listed on their birth certificate. The law also excludes LGBT people from state anti-discrimination protections, blocks local governments from expanding LGBT protections, and bars all types of workplace discrimination lawsuits from state courts.Several entertainment acts have already canceled plans for North Carolina but Silver said last week he didn t think a warning that the NBA could pull the All-Star weekend out would send the proper message, particularly because the league still has the Charlotte Hornets, owned by Michael Jordan, playing there. The Hornets host playoff games this weekend.All-Star weekend is scheduled for February. Silver said there is no urgency to make a decision because the league could very easily find out which arenas would take on the event if necessary.Via: AP News  ",NBA THREATENS NC…Let Men Share Bathrooms With Your Daughters Or We’ll Cancel All-Star Game

"Apr 24, 2017","Former White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that there were some  clear red lines  that would cause former President Obama to speak out publicly against federal action.In an interview, MSNBC s Chris Jansing asked Earnest about the former president s promise to weigh in publicly if he senses a threat to America s  core values.  Obama spoke out in support of protests of President Trump s controversial temporary immigration ban proposal at the end of January. What do you think,  Jansing asked Earnest,  would motivate him to get back involved in the public debate in a way that he s not willing to do right now? Earnest made clear that Obama would not be interested in responding to every little thing. After the last eight years, the president doesn t relish the prospect of getting back into the day-to-day fights that characterize governing the United States of America in the 21st century,  Earnest said.  He spent the last eight years doing it, it s somebody else s turn to do that now. What would motivate President Obama to reengage in the political debate,  Earnest continued,  is if we saw the federal government start to cross some clear red lines in terms of long-observed norms and values that frankly I think that we started to take for granted.   For entire story: WFBWatch:Earnest s use of the term  red lines  was noteworthy given Obama s infamous history with the phrase.

"Apr 25, 2016","It s easier to hate Trump and spew venom at him and his supporters than to use logic and reason Donald Trump has already forced Mexico to clean up its national image, underscoring how the country suffering from NAFTA could actually benefit from a Trump presidency.Mexico is launching a massive PR campaign to improve perceptions of the country after Trump exposed many of its problems, but this is a good thing: sometimes it takes your worst critic to enforce needed change.In fact, Trump s proposed border wall, hatred of the North American Free Trade Agreement and nationalistic views could help America s southern neighbor.For one thing, a lot of people don t realize NAFTA has fueled mass unemployment in Mexico, which has caused thousands of illegal immigrants to flood into the U.S. looking for jobs. There are no jobs [in Mexico] and NAFTA forced the price of corn so low that it s not economically possible to plant a crop anymore,  Rufino Dom nguez, the former coordinator of the Binational Front of Indigenous Organizations, revealed.  We come to the U.S. to work because we can t get a price for our product at home. There s no alternative. NAFTA disrupted Mexico s corn production so badly that 75,000 Iowa farmers were able to grow twice as much corn as 3,000,000 Mexican producers   and at half the cost because the U.S. maintained its corn subsidies under NAFTA.That resulted in the mass migration of Mexican farm workers flowing into America. The big wave in illegal immigration from Mexico began in the 1980s, but it picked up strongly after NAFTA   that wasn t unexpected,  NPR s Tim Robbins reported.And which presidential candidate has spoke out against NAFTA and other destructive trade agreements?

New Orleans Mayor Mitch LandrieuThe City of New Orleans removed the first of four Confederate monuments this morning in an effort to appease those who believe the monuments represent racism or pretty much anything else they object to. By erasing our past, do we change anything?Some on Twitter are saying: New Orleans starts taking down Confederate statues, like ISIS did in the Middle East removing the history of our lives. It s not that we can compare religious persecution to a cleansing of history but it does have some similarities.Emotions are running high because this involves a time in our history that brother fought brother and died Should we forget the struggle and refuse to honor those who fought and died? Isn t it true that we should always remember history and learn from it?We should also honor the soldiers who fought and died No matter what!A LETTER FROM A PATRIOT WHO MAKES THE CASE FOR KEEPING THE MONUMENTS:By William McMichaelAny Longhorn will proudly declare that The University of Texas is more than an academic institution. The University is a beacon   a promise that Texas will continue to produce citizens who care about its future. However, the removal of the Jefferson Davis statue from the Main Mall demonstrates that the university values its current students more than it does its future ones.I believe that society does well to relegate the memory of the Confederacy to museums. Its legacy haunts the United States in ways that many will never understand. Recent events demonstrate that our nation may never fully heal from the wounds that the Civil War inflicted. However, removing a statue does not equate to progress particularly when other symbols of Confederacy continue to stand on the South Mall.In fact, the crowd of students and professors that gathered to witness the statute s removal serves as clear evidence that the University worries more about public appearances than it does encouraging future generations to remember the achievements of the past. Much like the university, the Main Mall serves as more than a beautiful area of the campus. The university commissioned the mall as a memorial to the reconciliation of the North and South. Less than 50 years after the end of the Civil War, sons of Union and Confederate soldiers fought together on the fields of France during World War I. Their parents had taught them to hate each other, yet they persevered together to defeat a common enemy.The South Mall s designers arranged the statues in such a way that the sun set on the faces of the Confederacy, a sign that the era of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Albert Sidney Johnston would no longer govern Texas. However, the sun rises on the faces of men who stood as symbols of Texas  hope for a progressive future: President Woodrow Wilson, Gov. Jim Hogg, and Senator John Reagan   a former Confederate sympathizer who encouraged Texas to rejoin the Union.The statues look center toward a statute of George Washington, the preeminent founder who warned of the dangers of national division. The Littlefield Fountain bears a Latin inscription that translates to read:  Short is the life given, but the memory of a life nobly surrendered is everything. Ultimately, the South Mall reminds viewers not to honor the errors of the past, but rather that Texas can triumph in spite of its past. Yet rather than explain the Main Mall s history and purpose to the public, the University allowed errant voices to rule the day. As a result, future generations will likely forget the Main Mall s importance altogether. The moral of the story will be no more.Longhorns, do not continue wasting time by fretting over appearances. Fight for worthwhile causes, and remember your history. It will make you better, and thereby prompt you to change the world.McMichael lives in Waco.

From Hanlon s piece in the New Republic:Rejecting campus speakers is not an assault on free speech.

"Apr 28, 2015","Quicken Loans owner, Dan Gilbert is one of the most beloved business owners in the state of MI. Their headquarters are located in the city of Detroit (where people in the suburbs don t typically travel unless they have to). Owner, Dan Gilbert gives back to the city of Detroit and to its residents in a huge way, not the least of which is employing over 7,000 people in their Detroit offices. In 2014, Fortune Magazine named Quicken Loans a  Top 5 Place To Work  for the 11th straight year. When asked what made Quicken Loans such a great place to work, Fortune gave this answer: America s largest online-lending company offers cash incentives to its staff to move to downtown Detroit. According to Salary.com, mortgage bankers in Southeast Michigan average $50,000 a year, but those at Quicken earn $113,000. None of that matters to a corrupt government however, who has a history of shaking down banks. This time however, the goons in our Justice Department may have targeted the wrong business owner.Detroit s own Quicken Loans is the latest target of the Justice Department s shakedown of the nation s lenders.Justice s goons have been systematically extorting protection money from big banks and mortgage lenders, under the threat of federal fraud lawsuits and prison time for their executives.The department s modus operandi would be worthy of racketeering charges if carried out by civilian mobsters.First, the Obama administration whips up a blame-the-banks fervor after the financial collapse. Then, armed with federal fraud statutes adopted after the savings and loan meltdown in the 1980s, it scours the transactions of lenders to find hints of irregularities. It extrapolates from the skimpiest evidence a pattern of widespread abuse, and if needed, frightens insiders into coughing up creative accusations against their employers.With its  proof  in hand, Justice presents institutions with a choice   pay a large and painful fine to make the investigation go away, or try their luck at a jury trial in an environment in which the words  bankers  and  baby killers  register about the same revulsion.The nation s six largest banks have all crumbled, choosing to pay $136 billion in fines and admit their  wrongdoing  rather than get their legs broken.Quicken, owned by Dan Gilbert, has decided not to cower, at least for the moment. Instead of paying protection money, it filed a lawsuit to stop a three-year investigation. Thursday, the government responded by filing charges against Quicken, accusing it of submitting ineligible mortgages for FHA insurance.In its complaint, Quicken says Justice demanded a multi-billion dollar settlement based on a sampling of just 55 of the 246,000 loans issued. Defects, according to the lawsuit, include miscalculating a borrower s income by $17 and lending another $26 too much. In those meager mistakes, Justice sees systemic fraud.Trace evidence is all the Obama administration requires to put banks on the rack. To cinch a settlement, Justice adds the threat of criminal charges against individual executives.Quicken s lawsuit accuses the government of  investigating and pressuring large, high-profile lenders into paying nine- and 10-figure sums and publicly admitting wrongdoing, including conceding that the lenders had made false claims.  That s an exellent summary of Justice s racket.Requiring a public admission of wrongdoing, instead of allowing institutions to settle without acknowledging guilt, as is common practice, leaves open the possibility of future criminal action against executives, assuring that they don t squawk publicly.Gilbert is a different cat than Justice has crossed on Wall Street. Detroit street tough, he doesn t take to being bullied. Of course, the government has a lot of pressure points it can mash. Gilbert is in the gaming business, a highly regulated industry, and the administration is not above targeting his casinos.But I hope he hangs in there. This government has gone gangster, and unless someone takes a stand, it won t be just the big bankers who get pinched.Via: Nolan Finley, Detroit News","GANGSTA GOV ATTEMPTS SHAKEDOWN OF GIANT MORTGAGE COMPANY, Quicken Loans…Owner Stands His Ground"

In fact, we reported about hundreds of homeless people who were kicked out of a venue they used as a warming hut on the coldest night of the year because socialist Bernie Sanders (who cares so much for the poor and underprivileged) was about to host a rally in that venue. Oh well the show must go on who has time for homeless people who likely won t vote .right hypocrite Bernie?The small-dollar fundraising juggernaut that has kept Bernie Sanders s insurgent White House bid afloat far longer than anticipated has generated another unexpected impact: a financial windfall for his team of Washington consultants.As donations surged this year, the Sanders campaign ratcheted up its spending each month, racing through an astounding $45 million in March alone.By the end of March, the self-described democratic socialist senator from Vermont had spent nearly $166 million on his campaign   more than any other 2016 presidential contender, including rival Hillary Clinton. More than $91 million went to a small group of admakers and media buyers who produced a swarm of commercials and placed them on television, radio and online, according to a Washington Post analysis of Federal Election Commission reports.While the vast majority of that money was passed along to television stations and websites to pay for the advertising, millions in fees were kept by the companies, The Post calculated. While it is impossible to determine precisely how much the top consultants have earned, FEC filings indicate the top three media firms have reaped payments of seven figures.Sanders s money blitz, fueled by a $27 average donation that he repeatedly touts, has improbably made the anti-billionaire populist the biggest spender so far in the election cycle. The campaign s wealth has been a surprising boon for vendors across the county who signed on to his long-shot bid.The large profits stem in part from the fact that no one in Sanders s campaign imagined he would generate such enormous financial support. So unlike Clinton, he did not cap how much his consultants could earn in commissions from what was expected to be a bare-bones operation, according to campaign officials.A campaign spokesman declined to comment on whether Sanders feels the high fees earned by his media consultants are appropriate.

"Apr 29, 2015","Who knew that in our  First Black President s  second term killing cops would be all the rage in the black community? A Houston Community College police officer has survived an assassination attempt after being stabbed by her assailant 14 times. The officer was saved by civilians who stepped in and stopped the attacker. The attacker told investigators he did this to get back at police for their brutality. A spokesman from the family said it might be related to the Baltimore riots.Officer April Pikes remains in critical condition at Houston s Ben Taub Hospital, a public relations official at the Houston Police Department said to Breitbart Texas. Her alleged attacker, Jeremiah M. Matthews, 23, was pulled off of her by a group of men while he was stabbing her and attempting to grab her pistol, according to a statement from HPD obtained by Breitbart Texas.Harris County prosecutors said that Matthews told them  he had the intent to attack a police officer and his desire to kill a police officer,  according to a Click2Houston.com report. One of the witnesses, Abe Baker, who helped stop the attack said,  I saw him on her, just stabbing her. I wasn t really thinking,  Baker said.  His arm was just up getting ready to stab her and I just grabbed his arm and took him down, and that s when everybody else came over and we all just took him down. The HPD statement revealed that Matthews stabbed her several times before he was tackled and disarmed. The statement says he was attempting to gain control of her duty weapon. After taking down the suspect, the good Samaritans used the officer s handcuffs to detain Matthews until other police officers arrived and arrested him.The Click2Houston report states that Pike may lose her right arm. She was stabbed repeatedly in her right arm and torso.The scene of the attack was a Walmart located in Meyerland (Southwest Houston), where Pikes was working an approved off-duty security job. Pikes was in uniform when she was attacked. He was in an upbeat mood, whistling and he had a fast pace, walking fast,  Baker said of the assailant, who was smiling and cheerful right up until the moment he began his surprise attack. He does have a diagnostic history of mental illness in the past. To what degree that played into what happened, we don t know,  local community activist Deric Muhammad said, speaking on behalf of the Matthews family. He said it is possible that Matthews was inspired by the riots in Baltimore Monday night.The weapon was described as a hunting knife in a report by Fox26Houston s Kristine Galvan. That was an innocent woman. She had family, loved ones,  Abe Baker told Galvan.  That s someone s life and everyone s life counts and matters. Baker said he stopped by the Walmart on a late-night errand to pick up some laundry soap, and came to the rescue when he heard Pikes  screams. His quick action, and the response of the other men, probably saved her life. I want to offer my condolences to the victim,  said Vanessa Johnson, Matthews  mother, in the Fox26 video.  As a mother this is painful. I wish her a speedy recovery. My heart and prayers are going out to her and their entire family. The HPD statement from Wednesday morning states that Matthews has been charged with Attempted Capital Murder. His case has been assigned to the 182nd State District Court, which is presided over by Judge Jeannine Barr.Via: Breitbart News",BREAKING: TEXAS COP STABBED 14 TIMES By Man Who “had a desire to kill a police officer”

This entire thing really is a sideshow to the bigger agenda of the Obama administration. Federalizing the police force is next From the beginning, the investigation into what killed Freddie Gray has centered on what happened inside the police transport van. We knew there was another prisoner inside the van and tonight we hear from him. WJZ s Mike Schuh is the first to speak with Donta Allen about what he heard. I am Donta Allen. I am the one who was in the van with Freddie Gray,  Allen said. The one who the police commissioner calls the second prisoner in the van.  The second prisoner who was picked up said that he didn t see any harm done to Freddie at all,  Commissioner Anthony Batts said.  What he has said is that he heard Freddie thrashing about.  But Allen wants to set something straight.  All I did was go straight to the station, but I heard a little banging like he was banging his head,  he said. He tells WJZ he s angry about an internal police report published in The Washington Post.  And they trying to make it seem like I told them that, I made it like Freddie Gray did that to hisself (sic),  Allen said.  Why the [expletive] would he do that to hisself (sic)?  Allen was in the van because he allegedly stole a cigarette from a store on North Avenue. He was never charged. Instead he was brought straight to the station.  I talked to homicide. I told homicide the same story.  Allen said. A story he says is being distorted and now he fears being killed.  I had two options today right, either come and talk to y all and get my credibility straight with ya ll and not get killed by these [expletive] or not tell a true story,  Allen added.

"Apr 5, 2016","The big question is whether or not Cruz can get the necessary 1,237 delegates?Senator Ted Cruz soundly defeated Donald J. Trump in the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday, breathing new life into efforts to halt Mr. Trump s divisive presidential candidacy and dealing a blow to his chances of clinching the Republican nomination before the party s summer convention.On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in a much closer contest.Mr. Trump s loss was his most significant setback since Mr. Cruz narrowly defeated him in Iowa, the campaign s first nominating contest. And after largely dominating the Republican field from the moment he announced his candidacy last June, Mr. Trump now faces a fresh challenge: bouncing back in the face of searing attack ads by Republicans bent on stopping him, persistent questions about his demeanor and campaign organization, and a single ascendant challenger in Mr. Cruz.In winning Wisconsin so convincingly, Mr. Cruz, of Texas, showed he was capable of appealing to more than just the hard-line and religious conservative Republicans who have been the foundation of his campaign. But he faces daunting tasks of his own. One is consolidating the anti-Trump vote. Another is capturing more moderate Republicans in a series of primaries in Northeastern states that are likely to be favorable territory for Mr. Trump, beginning with New York on April 19.Standing in Mr. Cruz s way is Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who finished a distant third on Tuesday despite spending considerable time in Wisconsin.While Mr. Trump won among moderates, exit polls showed, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich received roughly equal support among those voters in Wisconsin. Mr. Cruz not only took nearly two-thirds of  very conservative  voters, he also won among voters who called themselves only  somewhat conservative. Notably, Mr. Cruz also won among those who did not call themselves born-again Christians   a group with which he has struggled in earlier contests.Most striking, though, was how many Wisconsin primary voters still harbored deep discomfort with Mr. Trump despite his wide lead in the race for delegates. In exit polls, 55 percent said they would be  concerned  or  scared  if he were elected, higher than the other two Republican hopefuls. And 35 percent of those who voted in the Republican primary said they would support Hillary Clinton, a third-party candidate or no one at all if Mr. Trump were the Republican nominee.Mr. Cruz s strong showing will make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to wrap up the 1,237 delegates needed for the GOP nomination before the primary season ends on June 7, when California allocates the largest number of delegates.Next up on the GOP calendar is the April 19 primary in New York, Mr. Trump s home state, where polls show him enjoying a commanding lead of more than 30 percentage points over Mr. Cruz, who in some surveys runs behind Mr. Kasich.New York awards 95 delegates, most of which are allotted proportionately by congressional district. Mr. Trump travels to Long Island on Wednesday to kick off his campaign. Trump has more support than anyone else in New York and always had,  said state assemblyman Bill Nojay of Pittsford, in north-central New York.  If the vote was held today, we expect he would win every single congressional district. A week later, a swath of other East Coast states vote Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Mr. Cruz s best hope is in states farther ahead in the calendar Indiana on May 3 and Nebraska on May 10.Wisconsin with its GOP electorate dominated by the kind of working-class, white voters who have been drawn to Mr. Trump elsewhere was long seen as fertile ground for the New York businessman. But it turned into a hotbed of anti-Trump sentiment. Via: WSJTuesday s stakes were the greatest for the Republicans since March 15, when five large states cast ballots and Mr. Trump s victory in Florida drove Senator Marco Rubio out of the race.Many Republicans hoping to defeat Mr. Trump saw Wisconsin as perhaps their last chance to thwart his march to the nomination. With no other Republican contests in the two weeks before or after, Wisconsin made for an isolated showdown.For Mr. Trump, it was an opportunity to add to his wide delegate lead and score an important psychological victory just as the race turns to his native Northeast. A win in Wisconsin, the sort of Democratic-leaning Midwestern state he has vowed to carry in November, would restore his momentum and undercut those most resistant to his candidacy.

"Apr 5, 2017","Here are a few facts:Sexual violence in Germany has reached epidemic proportions since Chancellor Angela Merkel allowed into the country more than one million mostly male migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East.Gatestone Institute first reported Germany s migrant rape crisis in September 2015, when Merkel opened up the German border to tens of thousands of migrants stranded in Hungary. A follow-up report was published in March 2016, in the aftermath of mass attacks against German women by mobs of migrants in Cologne, Hamburg and other German cities.Germany s migrant rape crisis has now spread to cities and towns in all 16 of Germany s federal states. Germany is effectively under siege; public spaces are becoming increasingly perilous. Police have warned about a potential breakdown of public order this summer, when young male migrants are likely to see women lightly dressed.During the month of July 2016, hundreds of German women and children were sexually assaulted by migrants (see Appendix below). The youngest victim was nine; the oldest, 79. Attacks occurred at beaches, bike trails, cemeteries, discotheques, grocery stores, music festivals, parking garages, playgrounds, schools, shopping malls, taxis, public transportation (buses, trams, intercity express trains and subways), public parks, public squares, public swimming pools and public restrooms. Predators are lurking everywhere; safety nowhere.Dozens of women and children have been assaulted by migrants at summer festivals and public swimming pools   staples of ordinary German life.Germany officially unveiled a landmark social-media bill Wednesday that could quickly turn this nation into a test case in the effort to combat the spread of fake news and hate speech in the West.The highly anticipated draft bill is also highly contentious, with critics denouncing it as a curb on free speech. If passed, as now appears likely, the measure would compel large outlets such as Facebook and Twitter to rapidly remove fake news that incites hate, as well as other  criminal  content, or face fines as high as 50 million euros ($53 million).Chancellor Angela Merkel s cabinet agreed on the draft bill Wednesday, giving it a high chance of approval in the German Parliament before national elections in September. In effect, the move is Germany s response to a barrage of fake news during last year s elections in the United States, with officials seeking to prevent a similar onslaught here.Already, a few fake news reports have emerged in Germany. One falsely alleged that a German girl of Russian descent was raped last year by asylum seekers. Repeated by high-level Russian officials, the reports seemed aimed at Merkel s open-door policy for refugees.Merkel is now involved in a strenuous campaign for a fourth term in office. The providers of social networks are responsible when their platforms are misused to spread hate crime or illegal false news,  German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement.The proposed law would apply only within German borders. But Maas said Wednesday he would press for similar measures across the European Union.

"Apr 6, 2015","Our culture is what makes this Nation great and very exceptional. Unfortunately, we ve elected a president who s changing our nation at warp speed with  refugees  (their words) deposited into towns everywhere: Working and middle class whites are becoming a slave class that toils to provide benefits to the Third Worlders imported to empower the ruling class of elitist liberals. THE CULTURE WAR WE RE INAmericans believe that they are exceptional because their country is exceptional. So the left eagerly swarms to argue that America is not exceptional, except maybe that it s exceptionally bad.Americans believe that individuals succeed with hard work. Obama and Elizabeth Warren bray that  You didn t build that. Americans believe in religion and family. The left sets out to destroy them by proving that these institutions are evil and oppressive. Religious leaders are pedophiles. The family is setting for abuse that makes gay people feel bad. When the dust settlers, the only  good  religion and family are the kind defined by the left. Having destroyed the existing system of organization, the left replaces it with its own. That is the ultimate goal of a culture war. Not mere destruction, but absolute power.The culture war begins by attacking abstract ideas. Then it attacks organizations. Then it attacks people.By attacking the ideas, it undermines the organizations based on them so that it can seize control of them or destroy them. Once that s done, it controls a sector of society and begins enforcing its conformity agenda on individuals. Much of that is underway. The war is drilling down to the individual level. We are approaching the tyranny threshold.At the individual level, the goal of the culture war is to destroy your will to resist them. The left has many tools for doing this.Please read the entire piece by Daniel Greenfield: This Culture War We re InOBAMA ESCALATES CULTURAL GENOCIDEIt isn t enough to invite illegal aliens to invade the USA in their numberless hordes and then quickly distribute them along with their exotic diseases throughout the country. Obama is now using your money to fly them directly from Central America, so as to save them the bother of traveling through Mexico:To facilitate the often treacherous process of entering the United States illegally through the southern border, the Obama administration is offering free transportation from three Central American countries and a special refugee/parole program with  resettlement assistance  and permanent residency.  The new arrivals will be officially known as Central American Minors (CAM) and they will be eligible for a special refugee/parole that offers a free one-way flight to the U.S. from El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras. The project is a joint venture between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the State Department.Readers will recall that DHS was originally set up to defend the homeland. Under the Orwellian Obama Regime, it is in charge of orchestrating an invasion of the homeland.After Pearl Harbor, some feared a Japanese invasion. It would have been preferable to what is happening to us now. If the Imperial Japanese had successfully invaded, they would have ruled for a time, but eventually would have been kicked out. The current invaders aren t going anywhere, and they reproduce much faster than Americans.Plus the Japanese never expected us to pay them to invade us:The candidates will then be granted a special refugee parole, which includes many taxpayer-funded perks and benefits. Among them is a free education, food stamps, medical care and living expenses.  A State Department official promoted CAM as a  family reunification  program that will be completely funded by American taxpayers, though the official claimed to have no idea what the cost will be.Who can put a price on the future?The fig leaf of  refugees  being allowed into the country ahead of immigrants likely to make a positive contribution because their lives are supposedly in danger has been dropped.The State Department official assured that applicants need not express or document a credible fear to qualify under CAM because  we want to make sure this program is open to as many people as possible. Consider this as part of the bigger picture of what is being done to America, and it goes beyond treason. It is cultural genocide.Our rulers know exactly what they are doing. From the official federal propaganda outfit Voice of America:America s demographics are changing like never before. In less than 30 years, whites will no longer be the racial majority in the United States.On the large scale, race and culture are inseparable. Americans are effectively becoming a minority within our own country. Our own democracy will be used against us to relegate us to a permanent second class status (as South Africa demonstrates, whites being a minority hardly spares them from Affirmative Action).Working and middle class whites are becoming a slave class that toils to provide benefits to the Third Worlders imported to empower the ruling class of elitist liberals. Eventually intermarriage will breed the last of our kind out of existence, as VOA happily implies:In 1960, multiracial marriages accounted for only 0.4 percent of all marriages in the United States. By 2010, that figure rose to 8.4 percent, with interracial couples accounting for 15 percent of all new marriages   a trend that experts say will only continue.The VOA piece was given the Orwellian title,  Experts: Coming Demographic Shift Will Strengthen US Culture.  What they mean by this is that the deliberately engineered demographic shift will erase US culture, so that it can be replaced by a multicultural utopia preconceived by cultural Marxists.It used to be genocide meant herding unwanted demographic sectors into gas chambers. But that was crude and inefficient. Simply diluting us out of existence can be done without mess   and incredibly, without resistance.Via: moonbattery",A MUST READ: OBAMA’S TREASON GOES INTO OVERDRIVE

"Apr 7, 2016","No matter which candidate you support, you have to admit that once again Trump has brought up a topic that needs to be discussed. BILLIONS of dollars are sent back to home countries from America. Think of how much we lose when $120 billion dollars leaves America! What if we tell Mexico we will stop this flow of money until they pay to build a wall at the border? The estimate for the wall is $25 billion which is nothing compared to the $120 billion that leaves America every year. While we re bleeding money out, the only amount coming into America is $5.1 billion Yes, $120 billion out, $5.1 billion in.Migrants working in the United States sent a staggering $120 billion back to their families last year, it was revealed today. The amount of money being sent by migrants across the entire world reached $530 billion last year, making it a larger economy than Iran or Argentina, the data from the World Bank showed. This worldwide figure has tripled in the last ten years and is now three times bigger than the total aid budgets given by countries around the world. It has sparked debate whether this so-called remittance money could be a viable alternative to relying on help from other governments. In the United States last year, more than $120 billion was sent by workers to families abroad   making it the largest sender of remittances in the world. More than $23 billion went to Mexico, $13.45 billion to China, $10.84 billion to India and $10 billion to the Philippines, among other recipients.In 2011, the World Bank estimated that U.S. remittances alone reached $110.8 billion, which was more than 80 per cent of the size of the total amount of cash flow ($132 billion). It is little surprise as the US is home to the largest number of migrants from developing countries; there are 42.8 million immigrants in the country, making up around 14 per cent of the population.By contrast, 2.4 million Americans live oversees, with largest populations in Mexico, Canada and Puerto Rico, and just $5.1 billion sent back in to the country, data shared on The Guardian showed. The data showed that the biggest beneficiaries included India and China, which each received more than $60 billion, followed by the Philippines ($24 billion), Mexico ($24 billion) and Nigeria ($21 billion). World Bank officials believe the amount they donate could be billions more because not all cash is sent through banks and money transfer companies on which the figures are based.Read more: Daily Mail",TRUMP IS RIGHT: How Immigrants Sent A Staggering Amount Of American Money Back Home

"Apr 8, 2015","This story just proves what we ve been saying all along. When it comes to unions, it s not about the members, it s about the union leadership and how they can increase their membership numbers (dues). Aiding union leadership in their quest to add members to flailing union membership numbers is just a way for Obama to keep the skids greased and ensure future contributions from one of the largest Democrat party donors (unions) in America. Congressional investigators say they ve uncovered another attempt by the Obama administration to aid illegal immigrants in the U.S.   this time, by teaching foreign workers lessons on union organizing.The National Labor Relations Board has entered into agreements with Mexico, Ecuador and the Philippines to teach workers from those countries in the United States their rights when it comes to union activity.The agreements reportedly don t distinguish between illegal and legal immigrants. But lawmakers are worried it s part of an effort to shield illegal immigrants specifically, by encouraging them to join a union and get protection.NLRB spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek explained to Fox News that under the National Labor Relations Act,  employees, whether documented or undocumented, are protected from retaliation due to union or other protected concerted activity. That means employers could be charged for dismissing an illegal immigrant worker   if the firing is determined to be tied to the worker s union activityHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia, argued illegal immigrant workers could soon learn to exploit the system, creating a catch-22 for businesses. They could instead be charged with violating the National Labor Relations Act because someone will claim that they re doing it because the individual is engaged in unionization activities,  Goodlatte said.He also claimed the Obama administration was trying to keep the NLRB union education agreements, which were originally signed in 2013 and 2014, quiet. This is the first we ve learned of this and it s the first that news organizations have learned of this   and they didn t learn it because the administration came out and told them,  Goodlatte told Fox News. They learned about it because of leaked materials, and again, that is not the kind of transparency the American people expect of their government. An NLRB official, though, disputed the notion that the agreement was a  new development or something that was intentionally being kept out of the news. Yet it isn t just the NLRB that could view union activity as a shield for illegal immigrants.In June 2011, then-Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton issued a memo saying:  ICE officers, special agents and attorneys are reminded to exercise all appropriate discretion on a case-by-case basis when making detention and enforcement decisions in the cases . . .

"Apr 8, 2016","Funny I seem to remember being taught as a young Catholic girl that charity begins at home .Pope Francis invited Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders to the Vatican April 15 just ahead of the April 19 make or break New York primary.Sanders has been invited by the pontiff to a conference hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. The conference will be dealing with  social, economic, and environmental issues. Sanders announced the Vatican visit on MSNBC s  Morning Joe.  Sanders made clear he has some differences with the pope but liked that he is  injecting a moral consequence into the economy. Sanders, who is Jewish, is married to Catholic Jane O Meara Sanders. When announcing the news, Sanders said he,  was very moved by the invitation, which just was made public today.  The senator went on to jokingly say that,  you know, people say Bernie Sanders is radical   read what the pope is writing. Via: Daily Caller Meanwhile back in Pope Frances  home country of Argentina, economic crises besiege them with the regularity of earthquakes over a tectonic plate. These crises can be devastating, wiping out family savings, employment and life plans. It seems we re always recovering from or preparing for some sort of economic shock. Sometimes, our survival strategies can even contribute to the subsequent crisis.Last month Argentine voters very narrowly opted for a political sea change, voting out the Peronist faction led by Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (she and her deceased husband governed the country for the last 12 years) and electing the conservative mayor of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, to replace her.The business-friendly president-elect ran in opposition to a government that has been highly divisive, defined by extensive social spending and statist economic policies that antagonized large business interests and foreign investors. Kirchner leaves office with a high approval rating of about 50 percent, thanks to popular policies such as a per-child conditional cash transfer policy for poor families and a focus on human rights, such as gay marriage. But the economy is stagnant, annual inflation is around 25 percent, and the fiscal deficit could amount to an alarming 6 percent of the country s GDP this year.President-elect Macri has promised to shock the highly regulated economy into market-based reality. One element of his approach will be the elimination of strict currency controls put in place to prevent capital flight. The cost could be a devaluation of up to 60 percent. Economists, like gym gurus, always seem to argue that a bright future can only be attained with short-term pain.The government s official exchange rate allows you to buy a dollar for about 9.6 pesos. But since 2011, access to dollars has been highly limited in an attempt to keep people and companies from taking money out of the country.U.S. dollars, with the enduring value they represent, are the holy financial grail. From small wads stuffed under a mattress to a security box filled with piles of cash, dollars are the gold standard for Argentines. Dollars are perceived as the objective measure of value   to the point where property, perceived to have enduring value of its own, is priced in dollars.Via: Huffington Post","MY POPE JUST INVITED A RADICAL, Pro-Abortion Socialist Named Bernie To The Vatican…Should Conservative Catholics Be Outraged?"

"Apr 9, 2015"," If you have a system that rewards you for being a victim, it s subject to abuse.  Sheriff Donny YoungbloodThat kind of stance has won him enemies in California s immigrant-rights movement and frequent comparisons to Joe Arpaio, the brash Arizona sheriff notorious for his workplace raids and ID checks.Youngblood, 64, said he isn t trying to make headlines. The Vietnam War veteran, who grew up working in the potato sheds around Bakersfield, said he s happier hiking or riding his quarter horse, Sparky.He lives in the same modest suburban neighborhood where he grew up, on Bakersfield s now heavily Latino Eastside, and bristles at accusations that his policies encourage racial profiling, pointing out that a third of his deputies are Latino.As he drove through town on a recent morning, past oil derricks, gated golf courses and strip malls lined with Mexican restaurants and carnicerias, Youngblood outlined his philosophy on immigration.The federal government should start enforcing immigration laws   or write new ones, he said. He criticized President Obama s new deportation policies, which say most immigrants who have not committed serious crimes and have fewer than three minor crimes on their records should not be priorities for removal. You re in this country illegally and we re going to give you three bites of the apple? That s three victims!  Youngblood said.  If you commit crimes, you oughta go. Youngblood s defiant views have made him a rare voice of dissent in what has become the nation s most welcoming state for people in the country illegally.At a time when the Democrat-controlled Legislature has moved to allow such immigrants to drive, practice law and pay in-state college tuition   passing 26 immigrant-friendly laws last year alone, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures   Youngblood is an outlier.He has largely refused to sign paperwork that immigrant crime victims need to apply for U visas, which allow some victims to stay in the country lawfully. As president of the Major County Sheriffs  Assn., a national advocacy group, he has asked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to share data with police so patrol officers can determine whether the person they stop may be in the country illegally.Youngblood said his department began following the Trust Act last year on the advice of county attorneys. But he said he reserves the right to violate it. If ICE calls me and says,  You have someone there who has committed this heinous crime, and we really need you to hold them,  I m probably going to hold them,  he said.Youngblood s approach has been celebrated by those who believe, as he does, that Obama has been too lax on immigration enforcement.And it has made him the target of activists who accuse him of setting his own immigration policy and of sowing fear among the estimated 66,000 immigrants in this rural county illegally. People are scared,  said Lorena Lara, an immigrant who was brought to the country illegally by her farmworker father and who now works for a community organizing group called Faith in Action Kern County.  They re afraid to call the police because they think they might be deported. Immigrant advocates have been pushing for more protections and political representation in the Central Valley since Cesar Chavez launched the modern immigrant-rights movement in the grape fields here half a century ago. In recent years, Kern County has been the scene of tense standoffs between protesters on opposing sides of the immigration debate, including a well-publicized shouting match outside the Bakersfield office of Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy in 2013.The majority of Kern County residents are Latino, but it wasn t until the 1990s that a Latino was elected to the Bakersfield City Council or the Kern County Board of Supervisors. (Political scientists point out that Latinos make up only about a third of registered voters and tend to turn out for elections at much lower rates than their white counterparts.)Youngblood says his views are in line with the conservative voters who have put him in office three times since 2006. Their ideas about immigration and government couldn t be more different than the electorate in Los Angeles, he added, even though Kern borders Los Angeles County. We are right-of-the-center on things,  he said.  I always say Kern is a county that ought to be in Arizona. Not far from Youngblood s home, Jose and his wife live in a run-down gray bungalow. There s a large portrait of the Virgin of Guadalupe in the living room and a dirt yard out front. On a recent evening, as the couple cleaned up after a long day in the fields, a locomotive screeched on nearby tracks.The couple came here from Mexico nine years ago to find work. Jose, who didn t want to give his full name because he said he fears retaliation from the sheriff, now earns $9 an hour picking almonds and oranges. He made $9 a day as a bus driver back home.Jose said that in 2013 he and his wife were attacked by armed robbers while they slept. The thieves stole everything of value and beat Jose for an hour, shattering his ribs.Organizers with the United Farm Workers encouraged Jose to apply for a U visa, saying he had a slam-dunk case. The crime was sufficiently severe, they said, and he had cooperated with the sheriff s deputies who responded to the 911 call.To apply for the visa, immigrants must present a declaration from the law enforcement agency that investigated the crime saying that they were or will be helpful.The Bakersfield Police Department, like most agencies in the nation, has a policy of signing all U visa declarations. Youngblood doesn t.Out of 160 requests between 2012 and 2014, he signed just four, according to Sheriff s Department records. I think he has something personal against Latinos,  said Jose, who prays that Youngblood  will find it in his heart to reconsider. We are at his mercy,  he said.Youngblood said he hasn t signed most declarations because he doesn t believe in the premise of the law. If you have a system that rewards you for being a victim, it s subject to abuse,  he said.The sheriff s stance has won him supporters, such as Ellen Fluhart, 70, a retired rancher who lives in the northeastern part of the county. She said Youngblood s decision not to sign U visa petitions  is his prerogative. Fluhart said Youngblood s views are refreshing in a state where politicians have passed bills that she says encourage unlawful immigration. They broke the law,  Fluhart said.  They shouldn t be rewarded. Tensions between law enforcement and immigrant laborers in this community go back decades, said Gonzalo Santos, a sociologist at Cal State Bakersfield. In the 1930s, sheriff s officials deputized farm owners so they could use their badges to shut down labor protests, Santos said. Some farmworkers were killed.Now the department is intervening in immigration matters, said Santos, who called Youngblood  a rogue sheriff. Youngblood argues that Brown and the Legislature were interfering when they passed the Trust Act. Conflicting state and federal mandates put sheriffs like him  in the crosshairs,  he said. It s unfair, because the law is so unclear,  Youngblood said.  Really what we re looking for is clear law, clear direction.

"Apr 9, 2016","Close your eyes and imagine a white professor telling his students there will be no peace as long as  blackness  exists. Now picture that teacher in the unemployment line with about 100 cameras and reporters around him demanding he apologize for his blatant racism. Imagine how many hard working parents are scrimping and saving to send their children to college to be part of a captive audience in this racist s classroom. Parents better start speaking up and demanding these colleges and universities hold these radical, racist professors accountable for the things they are  teaching  our children. No one else is going to do it for us James Harrison, history professor at Portland Community College, said in a lecture Monday for the college s April Whiteness History Month that peace in the U.S. is impossible so long as whiteness still exists.In a talk entitled  Imagine A World Without Whiteness,  Harrison declared confidently conflict can only cease once the power structure of whiteness is totally eliminated. Imagine everyone living life in peace,  Harrison said, building off John Lennon s famous song  Imagine. And how do we get to that good world is the question   a world without conflict. And to me, my interpretation of these words, is it would be a world, or U.S., without whiteness, in terms of the power structure,  Harrison said, offering his own interpretation of Lennon s song. Can there be a world without whiteness, a world in which white privilege doesn t exist?  Harrison asked his audience. My answer is yes, we can, because it s happened before, and it all revolves around individuals taking small steps to dismantle and demolish the whole concept.  The effort is working. Harrison said whiteness is on the retreat, noting estimates indicate whites will no longer be a majority in the United States by 2040 or 2050.But do poor whites have white privilege? Harrison answered in the affirmative. Most whites, even poor whites, he said, don t recognize they have white privilege because it s invisible. It s like a club you belong to without asking to be part of it, Harrison said.Via: Daily Caller",COLLEGE PROFESSOR CAUGHT ON TAPE: You Can’t Have Peace If ‘Whiteness’ Exists…Poor Whites Also Have ‘Privilege”

The justices have been considering his appeal behind closed doors since December, but have taken no action.  LA TimesA Second Amendment controversy arising from California, would be the biggest gun-rights decision in several years, should the justices agree to hear it.In D.C. v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, the Court ruled that the Constitution protects the right to keep functional firearms in the home for self-defense, and that state and local governments cannot infringe upon said right. The challenge now pending before the Court, Peruta v. California, involves the right to carry a firearm outside the home for self-defense.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling in 2016 affording county governments in California significant leeway in the issuance of concealed carry permits. Some permit regimes in the state are fairly accommodating of applicants, while others make it functionally impossible to obtain a concealed carry license. A group of Second Amendment applicants challenged the 9th Circuit s decision.Should the justices take the case and side with the activists, they could announce a constitutionally-protected right to bear firearms outside the home for the first time in American history.Via: Daily Caller",HOW GORSUCH Will Have Immediate Effect On Historic 2nd Amendment Decision And These Significant Controversial Cases
"April 1, 2016","Sarah Palin did that thing where her mouth began moving but her brain was in no way involved, and this time she managed to say some stuff that was both so offensive and so stupid that she stunned an entire room full of Republican donors into silence. Then people started laughing.Palin was speaking in her capacity as a Donald Trump surrogate to a room full of Milwaukee GOP voters (and unfortunately for her, a good number of reporters). Wisconsin is crucial for the Republican primary, and her presence there was meant to bolster Trump s sagging poll numbers. As a  winner take all  state, Wisconsin could be the key to whether Trump gets the nomination before the convention or doesn t. The stakes are very high   and he sent in Sarah Palin. She failed. She failed really, really badly.Her singular ability to create baffling word salads was out in full display. Reporters quickly began firing off tweets documenting the cringeworthy performance. By all accounts, Palin was met with a pretty unenthusiastic crowd. And things only got worse.At Milwaukee GOP dinner, Sarah Palin intro'd as ""icon to conservatives everywhere."" Man in the back snorts. Polite applause as she walks up.  Matt Flegenheimer (@mattfleg) April 2, 2016How do you know Palin has faded? 8 mins into her speech at GOP dinner and no applause yet. Some eye rolls and phone checking tho.  Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) April 2, 2016One moment did make people sit up, though. During Palin s rant, she floated the theory that undocumented immigrants are flocking to the United States because they are promised free soccer balls and gift baskets when they arrive.In Milwaukee, Sarah Palin says illegal immigrants who come across Mexican border get ""gift baskets with soccer balls.""  Reid J. Epstein (@reidepstein) April 2, 2016Sarah Palin just said that immigrants are being enticed over the border with gift baskets (???)  Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) April 2, 2016Who are giving these people soccer ball-filled gift baskets? Trump s opponent Ted Cruz and his friend conservative radio host Glenn Beck. Of course.On illegal immigrants, Palin says Trump's opponents are ""inducing and seducing them with gift baskets.""  Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) April 2, 2016In fact, as Mediaite notes, Palin s bizarre rant about soccer balls may stem from a two year old story about how Glenn Beck went to the border during the child immigrant crisis in 2014 with supplies for the children. At the time, Beck (and Palin) blamed Obama for the children being sent to the border to escape violence and famine in South and Central America. Beck enlisted Ted Cruz to help deliver the packages. It was their way of opportunistically doing something nice for the kids, while also publicly shaming a president that they hated.What s baffling is that Palin seems to believe that the soccer balls doled out by Glenn Beck in 2014 actually drove immigrants to come to America. In her delusional telling, Ted Cruz   a fanatical anti-immigrant crusader   is  pro-immigration  because he took part in a photo shoot with detained immigrant children waiting to be deported in 2014. If your eyes just rolled into the back of your head, imagine sitting in a room with her as she makes that pitch.

Their plan would have resulted in tens of millions of Americans being without insurance coverage by the end of the next decade. Perez made his point loud and clear when he explained that the reason Republicans are okay with this plan is because they just  don t give a sh*t about people.

"April 10, 2016","Given the fact that Donald Trump has often bragged that he intentionally used his numerous bankruptcies as a way to exploit the government (and taxpayers) into paying his debts, it s not exactly surprising to learn that the billionaire business mogul has a spotty track record with philanthropy, but the scope of his greed, revealed in a new deep dive analysis by the Washington Post, is shocking.Trump loves to brag that he has given over $100 million to charity in the past five years, but like nearly everything the Republican frontrunner says, the truth is much different. Trump published a list of 4,844  contributions  he s made, which seems impressive until you actually start to look at what the donations are.As the Washington Post discovered: many of the gifts that Trump cited to prove his generosity were free rounds of golf, given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles.Trump s campaign also counted a parcel of land that he d given to New York state   although that was in 2006, not within the past five years.The Donald J. Trump Foundation, Trump s biggest charity, was especially notable for its lack of well Trump. Between 2008 and 2014, Trump didn t donate a single penny of his own money to the foundation, instead he leaned on rich friends to give their money and he then sent out the checks to the charities under his name. What a guy.And while some of that money undeniable went to good causes, Trump also used a lot of his  donations  to shore up his political and business interests. The Washington Post again:His foundation, for example, frequently gave money to groups that paid to use Trump s facilities, and it donated to conservatives who could help promote Trump s rise in the Republican Party. The foundation s second-biggest donation described on the campaign s list went to the charity of a man who had settled a lawsuit with one of Trump s golf courses after being denied a hole-in-one prize.Trump s campaign had a truly stunning response when asked to explain why Trump s charitable giving was so weak: They didn t want to make Trump an easy mark for other charities. We want to keep them quiet,  said Weisselberg, who is also treasurer of the Trump Foundation.  He doesn t want other charities to see it. Then it becomes like a feeding frenzy. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.And while Trump certainly isn t the only rich person to horde his money for himself, his friends, and his business interests, it s worth noting that other billionaires have rejected this egregious level of greed and actually given vast amounts of their wealth to real, world-changing causes. Bill Gates, for example, has given $28 billion already and he says he s not done. It wasn t given to give friends free tickets to a game of golf, either. Gates and his wife have spent years fighting to eradicate the scourge of polio off the face of the earth, something he calls  a gift for the rest of time. Likewise, Warren Buffett set a charity record in June 2015   around the time Trump was teasing his presidential run   by donating $2.8 billion in one lump sum.Donald Trump has gotten pretty far in the election by impressing his supporters with his wealth. Many cite his business skills (debatable as they are) as the primary reason they will vote for him. However, is it not just as important to see what he does with the money once he has it? Unlike other people fortunate enough to have billions, it s clear he believes giving away his money to fight disease, poverty, or other social causes is a waste. He s repeatedly taken advantage of his wealth to influence people and get ahead.Somebody might want to pull him aside and let him know that money isn t something you can take with you when you die. He may even thank you for the advice with a free golf pass.Featured image via Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images", Report: Turns Out Most Of Trump’s ‘Charity’ Was Giving Free Golf To His Business Friends

Bridges, who filmed the shocking video and posted it to social media, told the Courier-Journal that passengers were informed that the flight was overbooked at the gate. The airline originally said that one person would need to give up their seat. After everyone had boarded the plane, they were told that four passengers would have to give up the seat they had paid for so that airline employees would be able to fly instead.They asked for volunteers and even offered money and hotel accommodations to sweeten the deal. But when no one offered to leave the plane, they randomly selected passengers to kick off the flight. When the man they had chosen to boot out of the seat he paid for said he didn t want to leave because he was a doctor and had patients he had to care for in the morning, United Airlines called the police.In the video, you can see the cops forcefully grab the doctor and violently drag him off the plane while he screams out in pain. Other passengers were horrified. He was eventually allowed back on the plane, bleeding mouth and all.Now, Washington, D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is demanding answers. Norton is calling for a congressional hearing into the incident. I deplore the violent removal of a passenger from a United Airlines flight this weekend. Airline passengers must have protections against such abusive treatment.

Many of them are ill-educated and have tattoos on their foreheads, and I hate to be generalized about it, but it s true. If you look at all the educational statistics, how are you going to get jobs for people who aren t qualified for jobs?The implication that blacks are  ill-educated  and  have tattoos on their foreheads  adds to the well-worn history of racist comments on Fox News, particularly from O Reilly himself.At a 2003 benefit for at-risk black children, O Reilly said,  I hope they re not in the parking lot stealing our hubcaps. In 2007, when visiting the New York City restaurant Sylvia s, which is in a predominantly black neighborhood, O Reilly said he was  surprised  it was like every other restaurant, and that shockingly when he went inside, nobody was  screaming,  M-Fer, I want more iced tea. He has also used the term  wetback  to refer to immigrants.O Reilly has also attacked groups like Black Lives Matter, who he claimed,  basically hate their country. Overall, Fox News has been home to multiple incidents of race-baiting over its long history, which reflect the values of network founder and president Roger Ailes. Ailes was part of Richard Nixon s campaign to ride racial resentment to the White House, and he later had involvement in the creation of the infamous Willie Horton ad that was used to attack Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988.O Reilly is just toeing the party line.Featured image via YouTube", WATCH: Bill O’Reilly’s Bizarre Racist Rant On Fox News Surprised Even Trump

Calling Trump a  big sulking baby , Stein hilariously pointed out that it was Trump s own fault for not reading the state s rules on the delegate process.While Trump s campaign b*tched and moaned about the  Gestapo tactics  that had supposedly caused Trump to suffer such a humiliating loss, Stein insisted that nothing of the sort had happened. Colorado s delegates had not been stolen, the system was not  crooked  or rigged, or anything other sorry excuse that Trump is claiming. Trump just sucks, and wasn t smart enough to read the rules beforehand. Stein mocked the ignorant business mogul: He didn t have one paid staffer on the ground. I assume he knows how to read.

The senator offered up Tuesday s special election in Kansas to replace now-CIA Director Mike Pompeo as an example of this trend. Although it was a deep red district that Trump won hands down in the presidential election, Republican candidate Ron Estes just barely managed to scrape by with a narrow win over civil rights attorney James Thompson (D). The Republicans had to spend money like crazy at the end to beat him,  Sanders said.  I think that s a very good omen for the future. Judging by the way the beginning of Trump s presidency has gone, you have to wonder if Trump will even get the chance to run for reelection. The FBI and both houses of Congress are investigating the probability that he colluded with Russia to steal the election. If he is found to have committed treason, he will most likely end up impeached and may have to worry more about a prison term than a second term.Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images", Bernie Sanders: Trump’s Dreams Of A Second Term Will Go Up In Smoke
"April 13, 2016","If you were one of the many political junkies crossing your fingers and hoping Donald Trump would attend the White House Correspondents  Dinner this year, you are about to be disappointed. The Republican frontrunner recently announced that he has turned down all of the invitations he has received because of the media. I was asked by every single group of media available to mankind [to attend this year]. But I ve decided not to go. Do you know why? I would have a good time and the press would say I look like I wasn t having a good time. Donald Trump attended the 2011 Correspondents  Dinner and President Obama hammered him over and over and over. He even had a photo of what the White House would look like if the billionaire was ever elected president, complete with  Trump  scrawled across the top of it.Image via screenshotBut Trump is claiming that his decision not to attend has nothing to do with President Obama repeatedly making him the butt of his jokes; it was instead the mean press  fault: I had a great time. I was very honored by all of the attention. The president told joke after joke and it was good. They were all very nice and delivered nicely and I had a great time and told the press. For four years, I ve read what a miserable time I had The press is dishonest. If the press would be honest, I d go because I d have a good time.   But no matter how good a time I had, the press would say,  Donald Trump was miserable. What would I need that for? Honestly, it really doesn t matter if it was the president trolling him or the media talking about his angry face throughout the dinner that is keeping him from attending   it speaks to a much larger problem he has: Trump is completely incapable of taking criticism   even in jest. He claims that he wants to run this country, but he can t handle anyone who isn t kissing his ass talking about him. And when people do say something about him, he lashes out like a toddler who was just told he cannot swing on the curtains. How is he ever going to deal with the scrutiny that comes with the highest office in the United States if he can t brush the big bad press off?Watch President Obama roast Trump at the 2011 Dinner:Featured image via Kristoffer Tripplaar-Pool; Scott Olson/Getty Images"," Still Butthurt About 2011 Event, Trump Refuses Invitation To Correspondents’ Dinner (VIDEO)"
"April 13, 2017","A few years ago, very few people even knew what Breitbart.com was. It was a fringe website that only white supremacists and other bigots frequented, and the people who posted anonymously there almost certainly didn t voice their views publicly. All of that changed in 2015 when Donald Trump began running for president.Trump s campaign brought white supremacy mainstream, as he regularly retweeted neo-Nazis, refused to immediately disavow former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, and readily embraced the white supremacist  alt-right.  Breitbart itself went completely mainstream when Stephen K. Bannon, who ran the place, left its stewardship to become Trump s campaign CEO.Now that Breitbart and its toxic brand of hate is literally steps from the Oval Office, people who are opposed to its hateful ideology are putting pressure on major retailers to pull their advertising dollars from the right-wing hate site. The latest to receive such pressure is online retail giant Amazon.According to The Hill, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was asked by more than 500 of his employees via email to stop funding hate by advertising on Breitbart. In another exchange during a meeting, another high-ranking Amazon official, Jeff Blackburn, was asked point blank by an employee to kill the Breitbart advertising because the site  regularly publishes hateful and bigoted content.  One employee said the following of her experiences since people now know what Breitbart is: When people find out I work at Amazon, the first question they ask is - How can you justify working for Amazon when they advertise on a hate site?' Now, Amazon is being heckled from outside its own ranks as well.More than 500,000 signatures have been accumulated on a petition that demands Amazon stop investing in hate  via its Breitbart advertising.Perhaps the most effective effort will come from the social media activist group Sleeping Giant, which has successfully gotten more than 1,800 companies to cease and desist with the Breitbart advertising. Major companies that caved to the pressure include BMV, Nordstrom (the company that infamously yanked Ivanka s clothing line), and Kellogg.Keep the pressure on, folks. Boycotts and bad headlines work. Personally, I ll be using jet.com until Amazon gets its act together.Featured image via screen capture from Talk Android", Amazon Facing Mounting Pressure To Stop Funding Hate By Advertising On Breitbart (DETAILS)
"April 14, 2016","Donald Trump has had a hell of a week having to accept that his closest friends and loved ones are abandoning him in his mission to single-handedly destroy America.Earlier this week, Trump s own kids   Ivanka and Don   broke the news that they won t be voting for their father in the primary. Today, another harsh blow was delivered to Trump   his top surrogate, Michael Cohen, has just revealed that he won t be voting for the business mogul either   because he s actually registered as a Democrat!Cohen made this confession on Thursday night to CNN hosts John Berman and Kate Bolduan, who were absolutely shocked by this news. In speaking about RNC chair Reince Priebus and the nominating process, Cohen let it slip that he wasn t really on Trump s side after all. Cohen, who is actually the executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, complained about the so-called  rigged  delegate rules and said: I think Reince Priebus has an obligation not just to the RNC but really to the American people.  . He s supposed to keep the Republican Party unified. That s what his job really is. And he s not doing that, and he s doing a terrible job at it. Do I personally, as a voter, as a supporter of Mr. Trump, believe that the process is rigged? I do. I think that the   establishment does not want Mr. Trump to be the nominee. Me, personally, I m actually a registered Democrat. So I don t really care about Reince Priebus. Berman and Bolduan hardly expected this response and freaked out. Berman cried, Wait! You can t vote?!   and Bolduan did a double take, asking,  You re not voting for Donald Trump?! Cohen pretty much dismissed their questions and simply replied,  Not in the primary. Amused, Berman recalled how strange it was that Trump s biggest so-called supporters wouldn t actually be supporting him at all. Berman said, So his kids can t vote, and you can t vote in the primary. Cohen tried to cover up how baffling the entire situation was by launching into a bizarre conversation about how he wished Trump could be his father. Cohen said: Well, I d like to be one of his children. I d like to be one of them, but no, I m not voting in the primary. I m a registered Democrat. Berman still couldn t get over how the candidate s own family and supporters wouldn t be voting for him. Berman shook his head and said: Man, he s losing votes from his family and the people who work for him. Then, in a rant ignorant enough to be mistaken for something Trump himself might say, Cohen dismissed Berman s concerns and claimed that Trump didn t need those votes anyway. Cohen, who previously supported Obama in 2008, bragged: You don t have to worry about Mr. Trump. He s polling at 50 plus percent. This is his hometown.

"April 14, 2017","A local news station in Boston has had it with the Fox brand damaging their own reputation. WFXT Channel 25 is going to change the name of its newscast to Boston 25 News removing  Fox  entirely following a drop in its ratings and a study that showed their audience saw the newscast as  leaning conservative. Fox News itself has some ridiculous shows, like Fox & Friends and The O Reilly Factor, both of which tend to peddle not just misleading information, but also the very attitudes that make things worse, not better, in this country. For instance, on Fox & Friends this morning, Brian Kilmeade whined about conditions in immigration detention centers. But he wasn t talking about the stunning human rights abuses. He s upset about this: Get this: They re enjoying seven hours of outdoor activity. Who gets that anymore? Fresh sheets, and absolutely   I don t get that. No need to learn English. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt added: Seven hours of outdoor activity, freshly washed sheets, and absolutely no need to learn English. That s the easy life of an illegal immigrant inside American jails. Or clean sheets have something to do with basic sanitation, but hey, they ll think what they want here. The outdoor activity   it s not like they re in some Eden-like garden of paradise.There s also the whole controversy with Bill O Reilly and sexual harassment, and Fox News  failure to deal with their male employees who engage in such behavior. Billo the Clown is still on the air, and so far, Fox doesn t seem to have done much about it.Who wants to be associated with this crapola? WFXT is actually owned by Cox Media Group and not Fox News, but they re still considered a Fox affiliate and the brand carries a reputation that is increasingly negative. Massachusetts is a deep blue state, and their businesses and media outlets need to act accordingly to continue reaching their audiences.This decision is actually a few years in the making   it didn t just happen. WFXT s news director, Mike Oliveria, said that Massachusetts viewers want unbiased news. Fox News is decidedly not unbiased, but WFXT strives to be, as do most local newscasts. He said: It s not that [Fox is] a bad brand; it s just that it s not ours. While other Fox affiliates under Cox Media s umbrella aren t considering dropping  Fox  from their names at this time, we have t wonder if that s going to change.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images", Local Fox Affiliate Just Gave Fox News A GIANT Middle Finger Over Their Biased News
"April 15, 2016","On April 11th, before he spoke at his rally in Albany, New York, Bernie Sanders met with local Black Lives Matter activists.  The local police department has a long history of corruption and abuse. In April 2015, Albany Police Officers killed unarmed 39-year-old Dontay Ivy. While he was walking home from an ATM they tasered him and beat him to death with police batons. Mr. Ivy was mentally ill. In the video, his aunt takes Bernie Sanders through what happened. No officers were charged in the death and a grand jury found no criminal wrongdoing because of a lack of witnesses. Allegedly the dash cams in the patrol cars were turned off. I worried about my brother all the time. I thought outside elements would hurt him. But the people who were supposed to protect him, they re the ones who hurt him,  Dontay Ivy s sister, Johnson, told Senator Sanders in tears.Bernie Sanders has lead the call for police reform in the Democratic Primaries. He was the only candidate who called for a Department of Justice investigation in December 2015 after it was announced there would be no indictment of the police officers involved. He was the only candidate who called for Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign over his administration s overt cover up of unarmed teenager LaQuan MacDonald s death. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who has proposed that the Department of Justice investigates every death caused by police involvement or in police custody so police departments can t cover up the incidents or protect their own from being held accountable for their actions. I got the racial profiling issues, I got it. And I got the need for police reform. What we should be doing is training police officers to deal with issues, although this doesn t seem to be a terribly difficult issue, this is not like somebody with a weapon or anything. It s a guy walking down the street, right? Going home. It s not exactly a major crime,  Bernie Sanders told the group backstage. What we don t have yet is a culture in this country that says to the police departments that lethal force, in this case using a Taser several times is a last resort, not a first resort, right? Clearly, in this particular case, it can be dealt with in a hundred different ways. The full video below, released by the Albany chapter of Black Lives Matter, shows the group s entire discussion backstage at the Washington Avenue Armory in Albany, New York. https://www.facebook.com/BLMUpstateNY/videos/1084906804903398/Featured image via Flickr", Bernie Sanders Consoles Sister Of Police Violence Victim In Emotional Backstage Discussion (VIDEO)
"April 15, 2017","Of course, when there s violence in protests, we hear a lot of blame getting thrown around. However, the loudest cries of injustice always seem to come from those who don t believe injustice happens to anybody but them   the nationalist, racist, white supremacist alt-right. Such is the case today with the violence that erupted at the Berkeley protests. The problem is, the alt-right was all over Twitter working to incite violence against the  antifa,  or anti-fascists, whom they ve branded as terrorists.Ignoring for a moment the fact that these guys wouldn t know what actual terrorism is if it bit them, one particular person on Twitter spent much of the last six weeks telling his fellow alt-righters what to carry to Berkeley and how to set it up. They seem to think that attaching flags to sticks will disguise the fact that they re weapons.Check out what one of the  leaders,  named General Deplorable, posted to Twitter:General Deplorable s diagram up there is about how to ensure those sticks always legal, so they can carry them into  battle,  as well as how to put them together so they re harder for  enemies  to pull away from them  in battle. Here are two other tweets that are incitements to violence as well:And this is General Deplorable s Twitter profile pic and info, which actually contradict each other:Here s the thing: This crowd of miscreants calls their flag poles  based sticks.  This is what they really are:This is what #BasedStick means: a flagpole that doubles as an insurrectionist s weapon. #Berkeleyprotests https://t.co/ZD2tGdqjk0  Marie Walshe (@lacanlune) April 16, 2017The Berkeley Police Department sees these as weapons. In fact, any stick pole, post, or the like that can be used as a bludgeoning tool (along with anything else that can be used as a weapon) are prohibited. To listen to these guys talk on their social media feeds and on their livestreams, though, it s the anti-Trump protesters who started everything, and Berkeley PD is horrifically biased. Yet, look at what they confiscated:Here are some of the prohibited items that have already removed from the park today. https://t.co/3qx3smYwgk pic.twitter.com/A70VCxFYEu  Berkeley Police (@berkeleypolice) April 15, 2017The American flags belonged to the alt-right, and the black flags and red and black flags belong to what look like black bloc anarchists. Lately they ve shown up at protests and rallies specifically to cause violence. They re who every  real American  conservative thinks are the  violent liberals,  but they are a minority fringe group which currently lacks broad support.It s not likely that they ll ever change their minds on that, either.13 people were arrested and of course, General Deplorable and others are decrying the arrests and Berkeley PD for being biased towards the anti-Trump side, because of course.But they didn t go there to hold a peaceful rally.

"April 16, 2016","Failed Republican vice-presidential candidate and reality TV star Sarah Palin is threatening to lead an open revolt at the Republican convention this fall if her candidate, Donald Trump, is not chosen as the nominee. Palin issued her threat to the party in an interview with the Associated Press:The 2008 vice presidential nominee told The Associated Press that GOP voters have the right to decide the party s nominee and will rebel if House Speaker Paul Ryan or some other  white knight  is chosen at a contested convention. Ryan said this week he will not seek or accept the nomination.Palin said voters know better than to be fooled by party leaders. How dare they?  Palin asked, denouncing  arrogant political operatives who underestimate the wisdom of the people. If party leaders try to intervene at the July convention,  we will rise up and say our vote does count, our activism does count,  she said.Palin infamously announced she was riding the so-called  Trump Train  at an event in January, praising Trump for  going rogue left and right,  allowing him to  tear the veil off this idea of the system. Her comments come as the Republican establishment continues to try to stop Trump from winning the nomination since they believe   and polling backs them up   he would be a disaster for the party in the fall against either of the Democratic candidates.Texas Senator Ted Cruz has tried to set himself up as the defacto Trump alternative, but Ohio Governor John Kasich has continued to run despite only winning one state (his home state). As a result, the anti-Trump votes have been diluted in primaries, even as Cruz operatives have worked in other party meetings to snipe as many Trump delegates away as possible.Currently Trump needs 1,237 delegates to secure the nomination. Right now he has 755, which is 210 more than Ted Cruz s 545 delegates. Trump is widely expected to win upcoming primaries in New York and Maryland, which will add to his lead.Featured image via Flickr", CHAOS: Sarah Palin Promises To Lead GOP Revolt If Trump Denied Nomination
"April 16, 2017","Not too long after taking office, Trump decided to start asking around about how the government could roll back regulations and make it easier for companies to get their projects approved. But he didn t ask ordinary Americans, or small business owners. He didn t ask people in small towns and big cities. He asked big corporations what their opinions were. He sought advice from the same people he blasted as  The Swamp  during his campaign, and promised repeatedly to drain it.Now, given who he s appointed to his cabinet, it was pretty clear that he had zero intention of draining the swamp. Trump specifically targeted manufacturers and fossil fuel producers for this, probably because he thinks allowing them to run roughshod will at least help him pretend he s truly bringing manufacturing jobs back. But this is even more egregious because major industry insiders don t care about people. They don t care who they hurt in pursuit of the almighty dollar. Of course they want industry regulations cut   these are the industries people fought (and died) against to stop things like child labor and worker exploitation.The White House got 168 comments total. Manufacturers went after the EPA the hardest, with 79 of those comments targeting that agency. The EPA received 79 comments total, because of course it did. And companies targeted the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts with 48 and 29 comments respectively, because having to clean up after yourself so everyone around you can breathe clean air and drink clean water is just too difficult.Trump s decision to halt key provisions of the Clean Water Act has already angered people, particularly those living in communities that are especially vulnerable to poisoned water. The director of the Sierra Club s  Beyond Coal  campaign has said: Trump s attempt to halt these clean water protections for mercury, lead, and arsenic from coal power plants is dangerous and irresponsible. After years of peer-reviewed studies, extensive input from medical experts and scientists, and thorough review of public comments, the EPA made the right call in finalizing strong clean water protections against coal plants dumping toxic heavy metals into our waterways As a mother, I m frankly horrified that the EPA would put the safety of drinking water at risk for millions of Americans, but that s exactly what they ve done. Coming from West Virginia, where we ve had enormous challenges with maintaining clean water supplies due to the coal industry s political influence, I m outraged that these common sense protections are under attack from the EPA itself. But, well, profit is king here, even though the coal industry is never going to recover no matter what Trump tries to do. A full breakdown of the agencies and regulations that these companies would like to see rolled back, if not outright eliminated, is below:BP says it wants to make it easier to drill for gas and oil in the very same Gulf that was devastated in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, because why force them be careful when they can lie about being able to self-regulate? (Big corporations can t self-regulate.) And The Associated General Contractors of America wants to roll back regulations for paid sick leave for government contractors. They probably want to get rid of overtime rules, too.Of course, business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are applauding Trump for this. They see this administration as one that is finally interested in relieving businesses  from a regulatory onslaught that occurred, principally, during the prior administration. Others are not so sure this is the best way to do things, though, because companies will always, always, always act in their own best interests, and damn the rest of the world. Jeffrey Zients, who worked on regulatory issues under Obama, said: At a time when many CEOS are focused on the short term and looking to maximize their profitability each quarter, I believe that a lot of their aversion to these regulations reflects a short-term mind-set that values reducing costs over anything else.That s unfortunate, because well-crafted regulations are an important part of creating sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. A detail. These companies don t want sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. They want unfair and profitable in the short run. It s the nature of the beast. And it s why the business world needs strong regulation. Instead, Trump is trying to give them back the ability to do what they want, when they want, how they want, without regard to the harm they cause.Featured image by Ron Sachs   Pool via Getty Images", Trump Asks Advice From The Swamp He Promised To Drain – Americans Are OUTRAGED At What They Said

Facebook has actually been conceding to the claims and they have also warned her of legal action under the same premise.Think about it. Out of the oodles and oodles of Trump pictures online, the only one he can file copyright over is one showing his wiener.This means that Trump actually is claiming copyright on his penis. Let s think about that for just about five seconds or so Special note: The size of the pixelation is in no way indicative of the size of anything it may or may not be hiding.Ms. Gore told the New York Daily News,  I don t believe I did anything wrong. It s my work and I ll stand by it no matter what. Once the image hit the internet, it went instantly viral and has gotten bids for over  100,000 after it went on display this month in London at the Maddox Gallery.As hilarious as this is, for obvious reasons, Ilma Gore has had some very serious blowback that isn t funny at all.Ms. Gore also said that since the image of the painting hit the internet, she has also been receiving many threats of rape, death threats, and had to deal with several stalkers at her home. It s typical of a Trump supporter, or even just your average Republican   when a woman does something to make you angry, threaten her with physical violence, terrorism, and death. At least Trump s supporters are an accurate depiction of the man.The portrait got a big boost in publicity due to an unexpected development during the Republican primary season. Ms. Gore painted the portrait in February, but not long after that Trump started bragging about the size of his manhood during presidential debates. You literally couldn t buy a better publicizing platform for your work than that.As I see it, Trump has two options here. He can either claim the painting is defamation by visually proving in court that it misrepresents his genitalia in some disparaging way, or he can enforce copyright by proving it s identical.

"April 18, 2016","Ted Cruz just keeps proving that he does not legitimately want to be president at every chance he gets. The latest dumbassery from his campaign came when his  national security advisor  Frank Gaffney, started lobbying members of Congress to refuse to meet with the people participating in the National Muslim Advocates Day.NMAD is an event where Muslim-Americans across the nation go to Washington, D.C. to meet with their representatives in order to voice opinions on public policy, and to also make attempts at outreach from the Muslim-American community to help bridge some of the cultural gaps that have developed in America.Seems pretty reasonable, right? We keep hearing how Muslims don t  do enough  to combat the threat of Islamic extremism in the United States from literally every Republican. However, when Republicans get their chance to meet with Muslims and do something productive, they turn coward, run and hide.And people say  they hate us for our freedom.  Yeah right The U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations released the following statement, regarding Cruz s outright cowardice of both him and his campaign staff in meeting with them:This evening, representatives of the US Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO), a coalition of leading national and local American Muslim groups, will hold a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., to condemn the refusal of GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his congressional staff to meet with Muslim constituents during today s second National Muslim Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill.Some 330 Muslim delegates from 28 states are meeting with a third of the House of Representatives and almost half of the Senate.Earlier today, 14 Texas Muslim delegates to the National Muslim Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill tried to meet with either Sen. Cruz or a member of his congressional staff, but were told no one would meet with them. The delegates had tried to arrange a meeting for several weeks prior to today s event.Source: Right Wing WatchSo, if Ted and his entire campaign parade of idiots are too frightened to actually meet with some regular Americans who happen to be Muslim, how will they EVER find the courage to fight ISIS? It s a question that needs an answer.Ted Cruz can t stop reminding us how he loves religious freedom and the Constitution. However, he condemns people for their choice of religion and denies them their right to petition their government, which just happens to be in the Constitution. It really makes you wonder if Ted even understands that he s running for president and not on a reality show.When Trump wins the nomination, and Republicans act surprised, they can look at their golden boy Cruz and remember they have nobody to blame but themselves for losing 2016.Listen to the Cruz campaign explain why America would be insane to vote for him below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/258517130  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /] Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty", Ted Cruz Refuses To Meet With TX Muslims Because He’s A Complete Jerk (AUDIO)

"April 19, 2016","Donald Trump has been called out by yet another foreign leader for his ridiculous plan to build the Great Wall of  Murica. During a Facebook Live interview by The New York Times en Espa ol, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales, a former television comedian, openly mocked the Republican s wall.Trump rose to the top in the Republican primary race by promising his supporters that he was going to erect a huge wall to keep Latino immigrants out of the country. Although he has said that he is going to force Mexico (hahaha) to pay for this monstrosity, he has also promised that he is going to have it built really  inexpensively.  In order to do that, he is going to need the cheap labor he rails against in all of his speeches, and that is what President Morales offered him: To the gentleman who wants to build a wall, I offer cheap labor. We have high quality labor, and we ll gladly build. Tell us the dimensions, and we know how to do it. The president could hardly keep a straight face when he offered to help  the gentleman.  But he quickly turned serious when he started discussing real immigration policy with the reporter, saying: We believe   although I have no reason to involve myself in U.S. migratory policy   we believe that it is necessary to think about migratory reform where many people who are there in an irregular manner will be regularized,  he said. Morales added that legalizing undocumented immigrants in the United States would benefit the country because they would  contribute more and pay more taxes. He is absolutely right, it would greatly benefit America if we would reform immigration. We have millions of undocumented immigrants living in this country who are contributing to society, but would love to contribute even more   unfortunately, they are unable to do so unless they are legalized.Republicans like Donald Trump do not consider that, though, not because they believe it is false, but because it is easier to keep their voting base energized if they have someone to hate. Right-wing,  poorly educated  voters need a scapegoat to blame all of their problems on and immigrants are perfect for that. Meanwhile, the GOP continues to fan the flames to keep their dumbass base in a constant state fear which sends them back to the polls to vote for the right s candidates. It doesn t matter how much the GOP is victimizing their voters by cutting funding for many of the programs that keep food on their tables, as long as they have  others  to pick on, they are happy.So, Trump will continue to push this Great Wall of  Murica fantasy, his supporters will lap up his rhetoric and world leaders will continue to point their fingers and laugh at us. This is another reason why it is so important to vote BLUE in November.Watch the interview below (be warned, it s in Spanish):Featured image via video screenshot", Guatemalan President Can’t Keep A Straight Face As He Mocks Donald Trump (VIDEO)
"April 19, 2017"," Build the wall! Build the wall!  Supposedly nobody builds better walls than Donald Trump, and the government is already hard at work acquiring the land and materials necessary to build a wall that s likely to do nothing to stop people from crossing the southern border. Now, a new study shows that the border wall may also be more a more unjustified waste of money than ever.Illegal immigration has been falling since 2007, but this latest bit of research out of the University of California, San Diego, says it will continue to fall. It s partly because of Obama   contrary to what xenophobic conservatives say, Obama did not favor or enable an open border. He made stemming the flow of immigrants a priority of his administration. The right wing is pissed because he also worked to protect people who were already here.However, the biggest causes of the drop are actually far more subtle and beyond the control of even the most hard-line, xenophobic White House. Economic trends, such as falling demand for low-skilled workers, play a huge role too. That s a long-term trend that these researchers don t see reversing itself anytime soon.There s also a major demographic component to this   our baby boom ended rather quickly in the early 1960s. However, in Latin America, it fell off far more gradually, resulting in a much larger number of younger Latin American workers who could find better opportunities here, in the 1990s and early 2000s, than in their home countries.That also is no longer true. The birth rate in Latin America is now about the same as ours, resulting in a falloff in the number of people trying to come here for opportunity. Furthermore, the population of undocumented immigrants that we do have is aging. Over the next few decades, they ll be forced to either start paying ridiculous medical bills out of pocket, or they ll find themselves forced to return to their home countries.If you combine these factors, the number of people trying to cross the border illegally will continue to drop. In fact, the researchers believe it will fall sharply over the next 20 years even without a wall.And yet, here s Trump and all his loyal subjects still chanting that a wall, which will cost anywhere from $21 billion to $70 billion and take years to build, is absolutely necessary to securing the border. But nobody actually knows how much money we could waste on this wall because no reliable estimates exist. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, there are too  many variables that are currently unknown  to be able to accurately estimate this cost.Yet they re asking for $2.6 billion for just 71 miles of new barriers for FY2018. That s a lot of money for less than 100 miles of barrier.We already knew that we, the taxpayers, were going to foot the bill for something that s probably not going to work. But now we re going to foot the bill for something that isn t just ineffective, but is wholly unnecessary.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images", New Research Shows Trump’s Border Wall Will Be Even MORE Worthless Than We Thought (DETAILS)
"April 2, 2016","North Carolina Republicans just would not listen when everyone kept telling them not to re-legalize discrimination by passing its hateful  religious freedom  law. Now they are going to be paying a huge price   literally   as you will see below.The Obama Administration is stepping in this time and has given the state s Republican legislature an ultimatum: Repeal the law or We pull billions of dollars in federal aid from your state.In a way, this should be a wonderful thing for Republicans. They hate the federal government and hate handouts. So, logically thinking, if Obama pulls out billions of dollars that normally funds their roads, schools, and housing assistance programs it will be a great thing for the state. Right?My, how quickly Republicans forget literally all of their ideology when it s something that benefits them. They re actually calling it illegal for the federal government to  single out  North Carolina for what they call  unfavorable treatment. Republicans don t seem to care about the unfavorable treatment they just legalized against their own LGBT citizens. I mean they can only get fired, evicted from their homes, or denied basic things like being able to shop in stores if the owners  sincerely believe  they are bad people for being LGBT. But that s totally different. Right?There are already costly lawsuits coming in from the passage of the law, and businesses are already threatening to leave the state   if they have not done so already. Add all that expense and loss of business and jobs on top of a few billion dollars less from the government. Soon their schools will be closing and roads crumbling with disrepair. The same people who voted these idiots in and supported the law will be crying about how bad it is in their state. But, Jesus will be happy with them. Maybe they can pray for the roads to get fixed.Featured image via camel city dispatch", North Carolina’s Religious Freedom Law Is About To Cost The State BILLIONS

She said that she has no doubt that Trump was involved in the latest White House scandal with Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He has done so many things to show he doesn t understand government,  Waters said.  He s not willing to learn. He doesn t learn from his mistakes. Instead of learning, he gets up the next morning and tweets something all over again. Then, the Democratic congresswoman said that what she wants to talk about is this: if we can prove Trump colluded with Russia, then we can kick his orange-hued derriere out of the White House. We want to know whether or not there was collusion,  Waters said.  We want to know about the hacking into the DNC and the interference with our elections. And I really want to know because I know that if we can prove collusion, then he is impeachable.

"April 20, 2016","The state of Israel has been able to cover up its racism to the world quite effectively over the years through the use of propaganda and a pretense to peace with the Palestinians. Some apologists for today s crazy right-wing government even argue that if only the current prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, would be replaced by a  dove,  then peace could be achieved with the Palestinians. However, the lack of peace and the fascism in Israel today is not rooted in its prime minister; rather, it is rooted in the ideology of Zionism that drives him and most Israelis. Zionists believe in an exclusively Jewish state and they always have. The only difference these days is that under the current right wing government, psychotic Israelis are the official main-stream of society and they burn babies and execute Palestinians without hesitation and they know that the government will protect them.This was all on display in Tel Aviv as thousands of Israelis came out in solidarity for the Israeli soldier who executed a Palestinian lying incapacitated on the ground a month ago. The soldier, Elor Azarya, who was filmed shooting the Palestinian last month in the occupied Palestinian town Al-Khalil (Hebron), is facing manslaughter charges. However, Israelis who injure or murder Palestinians rarely face consequences.Watch video of soldier executing Palestinian here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Bl9zAM5A4]Thousands of Israelis rally in support of soldier who executed wounded Palestinian https://t.co/EagsGN9gem by @RobertMackey  The Intercept (@theintercept) April 20, 2016Protestors chanted and held signs reading  Kill Them All.

He didn t just imply that Pavarotti is still living today (he died of pancreatic cancer ten years ago). While he and Italy s prime minister held a joint press conference, he must have decided to praise Italy for the gift of Pavarotti (or rather, he decided to use Pavarotti to puff himself up and appear more superior) by saying: Pavarotti, friend of mine, great friend of mine. First off, as stated before, Pavarotti is no longer gracing the world with his amazing tenor voice.

(((Shelley Rivlin))) (@srivlin) April 20, 2017But it s also not likely that Pavarotti was any friend of Trump s at all. Trump repeatedly used a recording of him singing Puccini s  Nessun Dorma  during his campaign, and his family asked Trump to stop.  Nessun Dorma  means  None Shall Sleep,  and Pavarotti s rendition has a climax where he sings  Vincero  three times, which means  I will win. We all know how Trump likes to  win. The family issued a statement that said: As members of his immediate family, we would like to recall that the values of brotherhood and solidarity which Luciano Pavarotti expressed throughout the course of his artistic career are entirely incompatible with the world view offered by the candidate Donald Trump. Trump may well have met Pavarotti at some point, but one would think that, if they had been great friends, he would have at least been able to act like he knew Pavarotti was gone. The family may also have taken that into account regarding the use of Pavarotti s aria at rallies if it were true.So not only did he again demonstrate that he doesn t know a damn thing about anything that goes on, and he likely lied about being great friends with that man. Pavarotti was a great man.

He s also been one of the more outspoken celebrities when it comes to opposing the GOP s hateful rhetoric (just look what he did when the GOP attacked Planned Parenthood). Now, the comedian is sending a special message to voters, urging them to act in the best interest of America by making sure that none of the Republican party s clowns are able to get into the White House.In an interview with the Huffington Post, Oswalt touched on the 2016 election while promoting his stand-up special Talking for Clapping,which premieres on Netflix on Friday. Although Oswalt has been a supporter of Bernie Sanders, he took the opportunity to clarify that he s not  Bernie or bust.  In fact, he wanted to encourage all of his fellow Bernie supporters to adopt the same attitude, for a very special reason. He said: I will vote for whoever the Democrats nominate against either of those two psychopaths. I think they re both equally dangerous and backward-facing for this country. When he was asked what he d say to a Bernie fan who would rather stay home and not participate in the election than give Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton their vote in the November general election, Oswalt had some harsh words: Well, then you re a fucking child. Well said. This is the same exact attitude Oswalt has taken to his over 2.6 million Twitter followers, urging them to unite for the Democratic party instead of divide.TwitterThe truth of the matter is that America cannot afford to have either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz as our next commander-in-chief, and the stakes are too high for us to lose millions of votes because people are upset their favorite Democrat didn t become the nominee.

"April 21, 2017","Earlier today, Donald Trump whined about being held to a  ridiculous standard  in his first 100 days as POTUS, despite spending two years bragging about all the things he would get done in his first 100 days. By now most of us know that Trump has hardly accomplished anything during his first several weeks in the White House, and there have been far more failures than successes.Now, the White House is joining in on the mounting pressure for Trump to actually do something before his first 100 days come to an end. The Trump administration is now bending over backwards to make it seem as if Trump s presidency isn t the massive failure we all know it is   and of course they had to lie to make that possible.The White House has just claimed that Congress is going to vote on healthcare and tax reform next week, and that the government will be open despite the fact that the Republicans don t have any votes lined up and Congress will only be in session for half the week. According to CNBC: The White House hopes language on a possible health-care deal can come as early as Friday or Saturday, leaving the potential for an agreement next week, a White House official told CNBC. The Senate Budget Committee is assisting with the draft, which would be introduced first in the House. This is absolutely insane, and clearly a response to the fact that Trump hasn t accomplished anything in his first 100 days and the Trump administration is desperate to have something to show for it. In just 4 days, Trump expects the House to vote on health care, examine Trump s tax plan, and keep the government open just so he can have at least one win.

Other members of the forum were unaware and taken aback by Schlafly s endorsement, and would have rather backed Texas Senator Ted Cruz.While appearing on right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones  radio show, Schlafly contends that after passing over her daughter, Anne Cori, for the position of successor, all hell began to break loose. The forum handpicked a successor, Ed Martin, but that notion quickly went down in flames.It was Schlafly s pick for a successor that shouldn t have surprised anyone: Michele Bachmann.The former Congresswoman from Minnesota and failed presidential candidate is almost identical in every way to Schlafly. They are both anti-woman, anti-gay, anti-science and oppose anything progressive. It seemed like a perfect match. Bachmann even recorded a moving tribute to Schlafly, who she called the pioneer of the modern conservative woman and her personal  heroine. However, as Schlafly got to know the Congresswoman on a more personal level, the quicker she realized Bachmann was completely unqualified to succeed her. Telling Alex Jones: A lot of our people wanted us to pick Michele Bachmann, and she certainly has a lot of talent, a very fine speaker and so forth. But she knew nothing about running an organization and she knew nothing about politics outside of her own domain. Ouch.

"April 22, 2017","Donald Trump decided that he would exploit a wounded vet to make himself look good, but as usual, all he ended up doing was making a total ass out of himself. Again.Trump was visiting Walter Reed Medical Center on Saturday. So he decided it would be great publicity if he personally awarded the Purple Heart to Army Sgt. 1st Class Alvaro Barrientos. Things were going pretty well until Trump congratulated him on being wounded in Afghanistan.You see, while the Purple Heart is indeed one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon someone serving in the U.S. military, it also means that the recipient was either wounded or killed. As such, it isn t exactly the type of thing you  congratulate  somebody on.Barrientos was one of four soldiers who was wounded when an Afghan soldier attacked their base in the Helmland province last month. As a result of his injuries, Barrientos lost his right leg, which had to be amputated at the knee. You honor that but you sure as hell don t  congratulate  it.Trump, accompanied by Melania, presented Barrientos with the Purple Heart during a small ceremony at the hospital. I heard about this and I wanted to do it myself,  said Trump.  Congratulations on behalf of Melania, myself, and the entire nation. Tremendous job. He may not think words matter, but here in the real world, they most certainly do.

So far, he s been incredibly racist and xenophobic, not to mention sexist, juvenile and just outright rude. All things that play well with a large part of the Republican base, and Trump clearly knows this.Knowing he s getting closer and closer to securing the Republican nomination, and knowing Hillary Clinton is very close to securing the Democratic nomination, Trump has made a clear pivot to the general election in his campaign strategy. Now, instead of making fun of his GOP competitors like Cruz and Kasich, he s putting more energy into making fun of Hillary Clinton. And I say  making fun,   that is literally in the most sophomoric sense it can be taken.While in Connecticut, Trump decided he would imitate the former Secretary of State and how she conducts herself with speeches. You know, like an adult   like a person who wants to be president.After talking about how many have asked him to be  more presidential,  he tells his crowd he simply can t do such a thing, because he needs to rile up and entertain his crowds so they don t fall asleep. Then he brings out his new attack line and nickname for Clinton and asks the crowd,  have you ever seen Crooked Hillary?  then imitates her walking on stage. Then he says,  Hello. How are you? This is Crooked Hillary Clinton?  and of course his crowd ate it up, because let s be real, they d be entertained by a paper bag floating in the wind ( oooh, so pretty! ).The imitation wasn t only horrible, it was in horrible taste.

Which, to be fair, is true if the victor is Donald Trump.Clearly not a fan of Ted Cruz, Trump suggested he would never go on to endorse him: They fight like hell for six months, and they re saying horrible things, the worst things you can imagine.

I think I ll go to Turnberry and play golf or something. It s bad enough that Trump is already playing the sore loser, but his gambit is almost sure to backfire. It s been well documented that Trump is despised at almost surreal levels. His unpopularity among nearly every demographic is so staggering that it s amazing he s made it this far. The sheer level of loathing people have for Donald Trump may be the one thing that can truly unite the country. He s hated by Hispanics. He s hated by women. He s hated by African Americans.

"April 25, 2016","Republicans were just given a leg up over Democrats in this fall s presidential election in the battleground state of North Carolina, and they have a judge put in place by George W. Bush to thank for it.Federal judge Thomas D. Schroeder decided in favor of Republican legislators in court on Monday, letting a controversial voter ID law stay in place despite strong objections from civil rights groups.Research on Voter ID laws have shown that these laws are often a reliable way for Republican conservatives to cut down on voters that often vote for Democrats, especially minorities and young voters.The judge, Thomas D. Schroeder of Federal District Court in Winston-Salem, wrote near the end of his 485-page opinion that  North Carolina has provided legitimate state interests for its voter ID requirement and electoral system. North Carolina s voter identification law requires people to display one of six credentials, such as a driver s license or passport, before casting a ballot. Those who cannot may complete a  reasonable impediment declaration  and cast a provisional ballot.Schroeder was officially put in place on January 8, 2008, at the beginning of George W. Bush s last year in office.The North Carolina law also banned same-day registration, cut down on the amount of days available for early voting, and stops 16 and 17-year-olds from preregistering to vote.An expert testified at the trial that the law was designed in a way to put extra burden on black and Latino voters. Republican legislators and the state s GOP governor Pat McCrory deny the claim.In 2012, a Republican Pennsylvania State House leader bragged that that state s voter ID laws would  allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania  (he didn t), while recently a Republican congressman from Wisconsin said voter ID would make the state   which has recently voted for Democrats   competitive in the fall for Republicans.President Obama won North Carolina in 2008 by 0.32% then lost it in 2012 by 2.04%. Polling in March showed the race in North Carolina effectively a toss-up between the Democratic and Republican presidential front runners.Featured image via Flickr", How A Federal Judge Just Helped Republicans In A Key Swing State
"April 25, 2017","On Tuesday, White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer once again baffled reporters and other thinking individuals by once again saying the dumbest thing imaginable.Asked why the White House refuses to provide documents related to former National Security Advisor and registered foreign agent Michael Flynn s hiring, Spicer took the tried-and-true route of blaming President Obama.Spicer explained that the Trump White House isn t responsible for anything related to Flynn s hiring because the documents were filled out   during the Obama administration  and  those are not documents that the White House would ever possess. Everything that the White House has been asked to do, the only documents that were made available to [Congress] that they asked for were the ones that the Department of Defense had,  Spicer said, explaining that he doesn t feel that the White House has an obligation to provide the information Congress has requested. How about these calls made where [Flynn] was working during the transition on behalf of a future President Trump?  CBS s Major Garrett asked.  Aren t those things that you should have some responsibility or obligation to provide if you can? It s a question [of] if you can,  Spicer said.  To ask for every call a national security adviser made is pretty outlandish. Those calls were made on behalf of the Trump transition were they not?  Garrett asked. Spicer, of course, told him that Trump isn t responsible for anything that happened before January 20 even if it was done by a member of the Trump transition team. When?  Spicer asked.  We started this administration on Jan. 20. All the information that they re talking about occurred prior to him being at the White House. Working for the transition!  Garrett pressed. Not at the White House!  Spicer snapped.  Everything that is being questioned occurred prior to Jan. 20th. Trump and his White House are absolutely responsible for Flynn   which is not good, as even Hillary Clinton witch hunter, Congressman Jason Chaffetz, admits that Flynn likely committed crimes.Watch this all happen below:Featured image via screengrab"," Sean Spicer Baffles Reporters, Claims Trump Isn’t Responsible For Hiring Flynn (VIDEO)"
"April 26, 2016","After a clean sweep of victories for Donald Trump on Tuesday night, he quickly took this as an indicator that he is the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party. He also took it as the perfect time to completely start to try to throw Hillary Clinton under the bus.There s nothing a misogynist is more fearful of than a strong woman, let alone a strong woman who has actual policy proposals and far more experience for the job you re vying to have. And with Hillary Clinton nearly clinching the Democratic nomination for president, and Trump close to clinching the Republican nomination, he went directly after Clinton for being a woman. Even claiming the only reason she s doing well is because of the  woman card. He said: The only card she has is the woman s card. She s got nothing else going. And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don t think she d get five percent of the vote. The only thing she s got going is the woman s card, and the beautiful thing is, women don t like her. Well, one woman who clearly didn t like all this talk of the  woman s card  was Mary Pat Christie, wife of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was standing directly behind Trump. When he uttered that phrase, she very visibly rolled her eyes.Christie s reaction was likely that of every woman across the nation who doesn t hate themselves for being a woman. Trump is showing that he is absolutely terrified of Hillary Clinton, otherwise he wouldn t say such a ridiculous thing to try to sway the vote. Hillary has more proper policy experience in her pinky finger than Trump does in all ten of his tiny fingers.Keep showing your true colors, Trump, because more women just like Christie s wife will be setting the narrative for your campaign as they roll their eyes at your clear ineptitude rolling into November..@ChrisChristie's wife Mary Pat reacts to @realDonaldTrump during his ""woman's card"" comments on @HillaryClinton pic.twitter.com/yNKo8wE6tv  POLITICO (@politico) April 27, 2016Miss it?

"April 26, 2017","Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order that would pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) unless they are willing to renegotiate with him for a better deal.This is what Trump had to say about NAFTA during his recent word salad of an interview with the Associated Press earlier this week.AP: What about NAFTA? What s the plan on NAFTA?TRUMP: What would you like to know?AP: I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating.TRUMP: I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don t even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.AP: Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal?TRUMP: I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.AP: Termination is still on the table.TRUMP: Absolutely. If they don t treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.AP: What s a timeline for that decision?TRUMP: It s a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it s a six-month clause.CNN reported today that two senior administration officials had confirmed that Trump is debating withdrawing the U.S. from NAFTA through an executive order. The White House is currently mulling an executive order declaring the US  intent to withdraw from NAFTA, a move that could trigger a renegotiation of the trade pact rather than outright withdrawal,  the officials told CNN.This isn t a new stance for Trump, who railed against NAFTA throughout his campaign. In June, Trump declared that NAFTA was  the worst trade deal in  the history of this country. I m going to tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal by a lot, not just a little, by a lot for our workers. And if they don t agree to a renegotiation, which they might not, because they re so used to having their own way not with Trump, they won t have their own way then I will submit under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal,  Trump declared to his rabid supporters last summer.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images", Trump Considers ‘Terminating NAFTA’ With Executive Order (DETAILS)
"April 27, 2016","The Republican senator who gained infamy last year by attempting to sabotage a historic nuclear deal with Iran is back at it again   this time by trying to derail a crucial appropriations bill so America is forced to violate the agreement.Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton got the moniker  Tehran Tom  after he and many of his Republican colleagues in the senate sent a brazenly out of line letter directly to the Iranian capitol in an effort to convince the country to stop negotiating with President Obama. The plan not only backfired (the Iranians delighted in mocking the Republicans), but it led to a major backlash from across the country. Politics may be getting nasty, but it seems betraying your country to score a cheap shot against the president still crosses a major line.Unable to understand when he has lost, Cotton has since been working behind the scenes to undermine the agreement any way he can. This week, he and his loyal band of obstructionists introduced an amendment intentionally meant to rankle relations between the two countries. Cotton had tried to bar the purchase of  heavy water produced in Iran.  Heavy water is  a component of making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy.  Part of the deal with Iran involved the country handing over its stock of heavy water (to show they were serious about ending their nuclear program)   but Cotton doesn t want America to take it. Why? Because then the deal would actually work.Needless to say, the White House was furious. At a press conference, Press Secretary Josh Earnest let Cotton have it: So it is clear what the intent of his amendment is. Senator Cotton is certainly no expert when it comes to heavy water. I m confident that he couldn t differentiate heavy water from sparkling water. His focus is on undermining the effective implementation of this agreement that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Cotton is fast becoming a single-issue politician. The time and energy he pours into trying to hurt Iran-United States relation borders on pathological. Even many of his colleagues, some of whom signed his letter in 2015, have given up thinking they can stop this agreement. Not Tehran Tom. He keeps plugging away.On Twitter, Cotton did not take the news of his White House dress down well. He suggested that he, a sitting United States Senator, isn t aware the existence of  sparkling water  because he was in the military   a claim many found  dubious.As for you @PressSec , you re right, I don t know much about sparkling water. It isn t served in Army, unlike in your ritzy West Wing.

The city of Oxford s city council passed a law that would allow police to imprison transgender people who don t use the right bathroom, in their eyes.The law would allow Oxford police to put those who violate the ordinance in jail for up to six months.City attorney Ron Allen told CNN the law was passed because some residents panicked after retailer Target announced that it would be open minded and allow transgender employees and customers to use the restroom for the gender they identify with.As if the law itself isn t absurd enough, here is the procedure required for police to arrest someone under it:Oxford Police Chief Bill Partridge did not return a CNN call for comment. But he told CNN affiliate WBRC the law would be enforced just like any other for a misdemeanor: A person would have to call police to complain, and when police arrive the officer would have to witness the crime.After that, Partridge said, the person who called in the complaint would have to sign a warrant.So-called  bathroom bills  have come along as Republicans need more boogeymen in order to convince religious right conservatives to vote for them as LGBT rights have become more and more mainstream in America, particularly after the Supreme Court made same sex marriage legal in the entire country.The laws rely on the belief that allowing transgender people the right to use the bathroom that  predators  would take advantage of the legal system. In reality, data shows that the claim that this would be used to assist predators to be completely false, and in fact the linkage being promoted by the right is just more bigotry and fearmongering.Conservative lawmakers in the south have begun feeling a major backlash, as businesses, entertainers, and other institutions have begun to pull out of doing commerce in states like North Carolina. Corporate America has discovered that associating with the modern descendant of Jim Crow laws is a bad brand image, and not something they want to be a part of.As a result, conservative Republicans in the south have seen their natural allies   big business   publicly condemn them and hurt the perception of anti-transgender rights states as business friendly.The market is deciding.Featured image via Flickr", INSANE: Southern City Passes Law To Jail Transgender People For Using The Bathroom

Fox News  social media team thought it was such a clever line that they went ahead and promoted it on Twitter.Things are not going well for Fox News.Tucker Carlson replaces Bill O Reilly after the Fox icon was fired for sexual misconduct that spanned decades. Tucker s show has so far managed to retain much of O Reilly s audience, but it s taken less than a week for things to start coming apart at the seams. By inviting disreputable guests like Fabio and Ann Coulter, Tucker has shown he ll aim to be more of a Sean Hannity than a serious newsman. Any chance that Fox News might try to clean itself up has already gone out the window.Sean Hannity, meanwhile, has become completely unglued since losing his boss Roger Ailes and his co-worker Bill O Reilly to sexual harassment violations.

"April 3, 2017","Sen. Richard Blumenthal laid all his cards on the table when it comes to Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. The Democratic senator from Connecticut argued that with the  looming  constitutional crisis facing the country and the growing likelihood that Trump will be impeached, Gorsuch should be filibustered.Speaking from the Senate floor on Monday, Blumenthal said that after deliberating carefully and deeply,  he has decided to vote against Gorsuch. He said that although he still harbors resentment over the way Republicans treated former President Obama s SCOTUS nominee, Merrick Garland, that isn t why he will be voting no on Gorsuch. But my vote is not about Merrick Garland. It is about Neil Gorsuch and it is about the constitutional crisis that may well be looming as a potential threat to our democracy. Blumenthal noted the testimony of FBI Director James Comey, reminding his fellow Senators that Trump is being investigated for possibly colluding with Russia to interfere with the 2016 election. This, he explained, makes the Supreme Court more important than ever. The independence of our judicial branch has never been more threatened or more important. The possibility of a Supreme Court needing to enforce a subpoena against the president of the United States is far from idle speculation. It has happened before in United States vs. Nixon. President Trump has launched a campaign of vicious and relentless attacks on the credibility of our judiciary. His disparaging comments have attempted to shake the foundations of respect for judicial rulings, the credibility and trust that is so essential to our Supreme Court and all our courts. And it is a respect that is vital to holding the president himself accountable to the people and our Constitution.The senator added that Trump had promised a  litmus test,  for whatever nominee he chose and as an  acolyte of hard-right special interests,  Gorsuch definitely fits the bill. Because of this, and Gorsuch s evasion of questions regarding civil rights, Blumenthal said he can be expected to attack abortion rights and same-sex marriage, among other things. All reasons he needs to be kept as far away from the bench of the Supreme Court as possible.You can watch Blumenthal explain why he will be voting no on Gorsuch, here:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images", Dem.

Approximately 70 members of the Traditionalist Workers Party, the League of the South and the National Socialist Movement were heavily armed when they gathered at the courthouse in town.Pike County is a very white place. At least 98 percent of the people who live there are white. The area also went heavily for President Donald Trump. Eighty percent of the people there voted for Trump. These are the reasons that Pikeville was selected for the rally. The neo-Nazis and white supremacists are looking to become more politically relevant. They picked the area because they thought their message would appeal to the working class people who live there.Pikeville residents wanted no part of the message the rally organizers were trying to spread. Most of the rally supporters are not from Pikevillee. Lifelong Pikeville resident, Elizabeth White said,  We have no clue why they would even pick Pickville. Why don t they go disrespect their own homes, their own people, their own families? We need Trump to tell them to go back to their own place. There had been a lot of concern about the rally as recent protests around the country have turned violent. One protester was shot in the abdomen at an event in Seattle. Several people were stabbed at another event in Sacramento. Unlike Washington and California, which have strict gun control laws, Kentucky residents are allowed to carry weapons. Organizers of the Pikeville protest said beforehand that their people would be heavily armed. That led some to be concerned that violence at the protest could turn deadly.Luckily, none of that happened. The three hour rally included harsh words from both sides but was peaceful.

The leak has embarrassed public officials all over the world, led for calls in Iceland for their prime minister to resign, and illuminated to the world the sneaky and greedy ways the rich stay rich and keep getting richer.In 2011, on the Senate floor, Bernie Sanders was railing against a trade policy between the United States and Panama, citing the country is one of the biggest tax havens for the wealthy in the world: Panama s entire annual economic output is only $26.7 billion a year, or about two-tenths of one percent of the U.S. economy. No-one can legitimately make the claim that approving this free trade agreement will significantly increase American jobs,  begins Senator Sanders, before asking the Senate,  why would we be considering a stand-alone free trade agreement with this country? Bernie Sanders answers his own question in the same way throughout his campaign he has criticized the broadening income and wealthy inequality in the United States which is permeating into a litany of other various social ills. Well, it turns out that Panama is a world leader when it comes to allowing wealthy Americans and large corporations to evade U.S. taxes by stashing their cash in off-shore tax havens. And, the Panama Free Trade Agreement would make this bad situation much worse. Each and every year, the wealthy and large corporations evade $100 billion in U.S. taxes through abusive and illegal offshore tax havens in Panama and other countries. Despite the harsh opposition from Bernie Sanders, the U.S. -Panama Trade Promotion Agreement went into effect in 2012, and more than likely has facilitated the ability for wealthy individuals and corporations in America to launder money and evade paying millions in taxes to federal and state governments in America.Here s the video: Featured image via screencapture", Bernie Sanders Predicted The Panama Papers In 2011 (VIDEO)
"April 4, 2017","In the age of Donald Trump, it seems that Twitter is ground zero for public spats, public shaming, and all sorts of back and forth exchanges. That is why this is the platform Lawrence O Donnell, host MSNBC s The Last Word, is using to troll Bill O Reilly s reprehensible behavior when it comes to what appears to be years and years of sexually harassing women from his throne over at Fox News.It seems that O Reilly is choosing to actually sue one of his accusers for speaking out, and O Donnell is determined to gin up as much public support as possible for this woman in her most vulnerable hour. He tweeted:O Reilly threatens to sue Wendy Walsh for ""defamation of Mr O'Reilly's character."" Sue me too because I believe her. https://t.co/jQ3y3mUvbM  Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) April 4, 2017That isn t all O Donnell did, either. He tweeted that challenge to O Reilly while he was live on the air Tuesday night, and asked all of his viewers to retweet it, thus showing Bill O Reilly that the game is up, that we know what he did to those women, and that we know that he is bullying, threatening, and intimidating the accuser who is speaking publicly, Wendy Walsh, so that she will shut up.This is what using a public platform for good looks like.

"April 5, 2016","Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus committed the grave Republican sin of being honest during a radio interview recently. While discussing the details of the Republican convention delegates, Priebus   possibly without realizing it   heavily implied something many have been suspecting: the fact that the Republican party will try to steal the nomination from Donald Trump.Priebus was attempting to explain the process of how Republican delegates work, and seemed to be justifying the concept of them not voting to represent the will of the people from their home states. He came right out and admitted that at the later stages of balloting, delegates will not be bound to candidates and can vote for whomever they want to nominate   regardless of the popular vote in the state primaries. The big giveaway, though, was the following statement he gave after that: By the way, this is a nomination for the Republican Party. If you don t like the party, then sit down. The party is choosing a nominee. To say that won t sit well with Trump voters and possibly even Cruz voters is an understatement. Trump s crew won t agreeably sit by only to see the Republican establishment walk away from them and install their  preferred  candidate as the nominee in his place.Reince didn t exactly come out and say it plainly, but he definitely is starting to lay out a framework of plausible deniability when it comes to a possible up-ending of the nomination process. By trying to explain away how a sleeper candidate can be squeezed in at the last minute, and spreading out the blame among many different delegates   some of whom are virtually unknown to regular voters   the RNC can just throw up their hands and say there was  nothing they could do, because of the rules. Many sources have been hinting at either Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney being rolled out as the panic-button replacement for Trump. The importance of this can t be understated. A very sizeable amount of the 2016 RNC delegates were previously in the camp of the Romney/Ryan ticket in 2012, and the odds favor a majority of them jumping ship to one of those two in lieu of Trump if a legitimate opportunity to do so arose.If the Republicans keep on this track and risk it all in an  anything but Trump  move, 2016 could be historical for the fact it might split the GOP permanently.Listen to the full interview where the RNC chair accidentally tells the truth below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/257440153  params= auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true  width= 100%  height= 450  iframe= true  /]Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty", Is A GOP Civil War Coming?

"April 5, 2017","While it can be said that no one is immune from punishment, a terrific example of that fact is how a Secret Service agent who was on Mike Pence s detail just got himself arrested.Why was he arrested? For getting caught soliciting sex from a prostitute.According to CNN:  a Secret Service agent on Vice President Mike Pence s detail has been suspended from official duties after meeting a prostitute at a Maryland hotel. One law enforcement source says the agent was caught after police saw him exiting the hotel. Apparently, this is how it all went down: The police responded to a call from the hotel manager who became suspicious of activity in one of the rooms. The source said this was not a sting. Now, even though the agent was off duty and wasn t currently guarding the *vice president, it is still illegal to solicit sex.CNN reports: A Secret Service spokesperson, speaking on the record, acknowledges  an alleged incident  occurred and says it involved an off-duty Secret Service employee and said that the matter is under investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility to determine the facts.According to the spokesperson, the employee was required to surrender his weapon and official gear and was placed on administrative leave. The employee s security clearance and access to all Secret Service facilities has also been suspended. Tsk tsk. You d think someone, especially in the Secret Service, would know better. Especially considering the history of prostitutes with agents in the Secret Service.Who can forget the Colombian prostitute scandal of 2012 when nine Secret Service agents had been discovered bringing hookers back to their rooms?Mike Pence s former Secret Service agent will be disciplined, but it still doesn t look good for the entire United States Secret Service, or the *vice president for that matter.

"April 6, 2016","In what seems to be another misspeak moment for the Sanders  campaign, Bernie s campaign manager Jeff Weaver appeared on CNN and completely stuck his foot in his mouth for going after Hillary Clinton s ambition to be president. I mean, is she not supposed to be ambitious? Wouldn t ambition be a good quality in a leader? Someone that wants to get the job done?Weaver said: Don t destroy the Democratic Party to satisfy the secretary s ambitions to become president of the United States. What he probably doesn t realize, in his ridiculously sexist remark, is the fact that he just directly ripped off an article from  The Onion  that was written back in 2006 before Hillary s first run at the White House.That story, literally titled  Hillary Clinton Is Too Ambitious To Be The First Female President  was of course making a parody of sorts and went after folks who thought it wise to go after Clinton for having the audacity to run for president. They said: I think it s about time we had a female president of the United States. I don t care what anyone says: Women can be just as smart and qualified as men especially the clowns we ve had in Washington lately. But Hillary Clinton? She s just a little too ambitious to do what no woman before her has ever done.Hillary seems to think she knows what our country needs better than anyone else, and believes that she, among the hundreds or thousands of qualified politicians, is the only one who can do it. Is that really the sort of person we want at the helm of our federal government? Also saying: Hillary doesn t shy away from tough situations, as she proved with her health- care proposal during her husband s first term. She likes to tackle the hard problems, no matter how entrenched the current failing system seems to be. Is it just me, or should the woman who  overturns a 230-year-old tradition not have such a tendency to rock the boat?Hillary has some very strong opinions, and she certainly doesn t hesitate to voice them. She s got an entire website dedicated to her positions on every last little thing. In debates, she always wants to have the last word. She s in love with the sound of her own voice. That s not the sort of person who should be in politics, much less the White House.Do we really want the first woman leading the free world to be such an outright take-charge type? Basically saying everything that every man has ever done who s ever run for office, but you know, since it s Hillary, well then she s  too ambitious. Now, let it be known that Weaver is not Sanders, and Sanders did not say this. However, this sort of talk doesn t make the candidate look good and should likely be reined in a tad. Maybe by Tad?C mon, Weaver, this is just awful.Here s the video via The Hill: Featured photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Sander’s Campaign Manager Literally Stole An ‘Onion’ Story To Throw Clinton Under The Bus (VIDEO)
"April 6, 2017","We already knew that Russia wanted Donald Trump to be president and interfered with the election, but new information has just been revealed showing that not only was the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) aware of this, but they were in the know as early as August of 2016. That s well before anything was revealed to the public.According to the New York Times: The C.I.A. told senior lawmakers in classified briefings last summer that it had information indicating that Russia was working to help elect Donald J. Trump president, a finding that did not emerge publicly until after Mr. Trump s victory months later, former government officials say. Further: The former officials said that in late August   10 weeks before the election   John O. Brennan, then the C.I.A. director, was so concerned about increasing evidence of Russia s election meddling that he began a series of urgent, individual briefings for eight top members of Congress, some of them on secure phone lines while they were on their summer break.It is unclear what new intelligence might have prompted the classified briefings. But with concerns growing both internally and publicly at the time about a significant Russian breach of the Democratic National Committee, the C.I.A. began seeing signs of possible connections to the Trump campaign, the officials said. By the final weeks of the campaign, Congress and the intelligence agencies were racing to understand the scope of the Russia threat. Then there s this: The officials said Mr. Brennan also indicated that unnamed advisers to Mr. Trump might be working with the Russians to interfere in the election. So, not only did Russia work to get Trump elected, but those closely connected to Trump may have been working directly with Russia.Here s the thing   if this information was available before the election, and it was well known that not only was Russia trying to influence the election, but Trump advisers may have been talking directly to Russia, why was the election allowed to even go forward? For all intents and purposes, the election should be considered absolutely illegitimate and a new election should be held in light of all this new information.Our democracy and the core of everything we are as a republic has been compromised by a foreign adversary, and NOTHING has been done. This is NOT okay.The public had a right to know this information going into the voting booth, and nothing was said.

"April 7, 2016","The Black Widow just delivered a super smackdown of Republicans for messing with women s health.Republicans on the federal and state level have repeatedly assaulted Planned Parenthood for years now, with some GOP-controlled states actually going so far as to strip funding from the women s healthcare provider, rendering them helpless to provide services that women need.The attacks against Planned Parenthood stem from the Republican effort to ban abortion and punish anyone who gets one or performs one, even though the procedure is legal and a constitutionally protected right.But in trying to destroy Planned Parenthood, Republicans are also taking away crucial medical serives such as cancer screenings. STD treatments, and access to the contraception that would prevent abortions in the first place by preventing unwanted pregnancies.And that makes Republicans a bunch of evil anti-women villains who need a serious ass-kicking.During an interview with Cosmopolitan on Thursday, Johansson provided that ass-kicking by defending Planned Parenthood.She began by criticizing Republicans for focusing so much on defunding Planned Parenthood when there are so many problems in the world that need immediate attention. There are countries at war, there s terrorism, global warming, and we re like,  We should definitely cut the budget for Planned Parenthood. Let s take away the availability of women s health initiatives!  It s nuts,  Johansson said.  We re talking about preventing cervical and breast cancers. Johansson also explained that she and some of her friends have relied on Planned Parenthood for their healthcare needs and blasted Republicans for trying to take away the only healthcare that millions of women have access to and can afford, and if they lose it, women who need an abortion will risk their lives to get one. Growing up, I used [PP s] services. All my girlfriends did not just for birth control but for Pap smears and breast exams. You read about the rise of back-alley abortions, women having to mutilate themselves and teenagers having to seek help in unsafe conditions, and for what?!

"April 7, 2017","The New York Times recently published a bombshell story about the culture of sexual harassment at Fox News, and their star host, Bill O Reilly, is at the center of it. The Times story says that O Reilly and Fox News paid five women more than $13 million in hush money who accused O Reilly of sexually harassing them. As a result, more than 50 important advertisers have pulled out of advertising their goods on The O Reilly Factor.In fact, so many ads have been pulled that Thursday s show included almost no ads at all, and certainly none from nationally recognized brands. Seemingly, as a result of all of these companies running as far and fast as they can from the public relations nightmare that is Bill O Reilly, the Thursday night edition of O Reilly s show was bizarrely cut short.There was no explanation for the abrupt ending to O Reilly s broadcast. The show usually lasts an hour, but was only on for 45 minutes. Throughout the show, O Reilly had kept promising a funny segment with Jesse Waters, who usually goes out and talks to people on the street in a mean-spirited segment meant to embarrass people and make them look bad on the air. That segment never came.Instead of the Waters segment, at the end of O Reilly s strangely short show, fellow Fox anchor Shep Smith spent the extra 15 minutes reporting on the goings on in Syria. This was prior to the world knowing that Trump had launched 59 tomahawk cruise missiles into a Syrian airfield in response to the chemical weapons attack, so it s not like this was any sort of breaking news segment.When O Reilly s extra 15 minutes was up, Smith s time ended, and Tucker Carlson s show started right on cue, with no mention of what happened to O Reilly, and no explanation.Hopefully, this is a sign that Bill O Reilly is on his way out at Fox, and his toxic message will poison the airwaves no more.Featured image via video screen capture", Bill O’Reilly’s Show Bizarrely Cut Short In Wake Of Advertisers’ Mass Exodus (DETAILS)
"April 8, 2016","Speaking to Democrats at a fundraiser at actor Tobey Maguire s house in California, President Obama issued a warning to his party that in addition to their focus on the presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, they desperately need to think about moving Congress out of Republican hands and back towards the Democrats.President Obama collected more than $1 million for his party s House and Senate candidates from Hollywood s Democratic elite Thursday and Friday, and left his deep-pocketed backers with what he termed a  professorial  lecture on the importance of recapturing Congress.Obama also told supporters that he would not be making an endorsement yet in the presidential contest (incumbent presidents usually wait until the party has chosen a successor in order to make a formal announcement). And he joked that he and his staff were too tired to run for a third term, even if he could.At another fundraiser, Obama pointed out that getting Democrats back in charge of Congress is very important.On Thursday night, Obama attended a large gathering at the Bel Air mansion of Disney Chairman Alan Horn and his environmentalist wife, Cindy. There, the president stressed the importance of  recognizing the enormous power of Congress and the difference between a Nancy Pelosi being Speaker of the House and a Paul Ryan being Speaker of the House. The President also highlighted the GOP blockade of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, even though Garland has received praise from across the political spectrum. And he pointed out that the blockade would be eroded with more Democratic votes in the Senate since,  What we ve seen out of the Republicans in the Senate is not simply a refusal to confirm him thus far, but a refusal to meet with him or to have a hearing, or to have a vote. Obama went on to point out that crazed statements from Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have also helped to expose some of the extremism that happens every day in the House and Senate from Republicans, saying,  People act as if these folks are outliers. But they re not. The President said widespread coverage of their speeches and statements could help to motivate voters.Featured image via Flickr"," Obama Tells Dems: This Is As Important As Hillary Vs Bernie, And You’re Blowing It!"
"April 8, 2017","Earlier this week, Devin Nunes finally recused himself from the House Intel Committee s probe on Russian election tampering, putting Mike Conaway of Texas in charge. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, remains in place. Schiff has been working tirelessly to ensure that Nunes  decision to leak classified info, and to talk to Agent Cheeto before the rest of his committee, doesn t derail the House s investigation any more than it has to.But some Republicans are apparently unhappy with Schiff still being there. One such Republican is former House Intel Chairman Mike Rogers, who seems to think that if Nunes had to recuse himself from the probe, then Schiff should likewise recuse himself. His reasoning is almost as batty as Mike Conaway s reasoning that Mexican performing artists are the same as Russian hackers: Representative Adam Schiff should consider recusing himself from the probe. For his part, Schiff suggested to the media that he had seen information on Russia-Trump campaign ties that was  the kind of evidence  that would be presented to a grand jury, adding that he had seen additional evidence, but not elaborating further. He went on to ask how the committee could continue doing its business when secret information is publicly discussed, even by innuendo. Except Schiff didn t go running to others with documents in hand. He simply explained how he interpreted what he had seen, without revealing what he had seen.Republicans seem to be incapable of making valid comparisons.Rogers has a serious problem with Schiff because he believes that Schiff politicized the committee s investigation. He couldn t be more wrong. It was Nunes who politicized it when he took information directly to Trump before presenting it to the rest of the committee.Rogers is right about one thing: The committee needs to get back on track as soon as possible. That won t happen without Schiff, though, because he s been relentless in trying to keep the committee on track. Rogers  call for him to recuse himself positively reeks of,  No fair!

"April 9, 2016","There are apparently still folks who believe that because the LGBT community is gaining more and more equality, and because women have the right to make their own medical decisions, they are being forced to promote being gay and apparently forcing abortions on everyone.Case in point   Arizona Pastor Steven Anderson of Faithful Word Baptist Church.Anderson seems discontent in knowing the United States is offering too much freedom for all. He seems to think the rule of his God should be the ruler of all. And now, he s even going after the Pledge of Allegiance, because he somehow thinks that by reciting it he s being forced to promote homosexuality and abortion.During one of his sermons, he said: One nation, corrupt, perverted, promoting abortion and homosexuality to all. Not gonna do it, my friend. Get mad at me. Quit the church. Umm  granting equality under the law to people who are part of the LGBT community or letting women have control over their own bodies is not  promoting  anything   it s freedom. Something the United States kinda prides itself on. He doesn t seem to understand that he isn t being forced to do anything he doesn t want to do. He can still live his life with hate in his heart and no one will do a damn thing about it. He said: I don t want anything to do with sodomy. It s wicked. I don t want anything to do with abortion. I don t want anything to do with the things that our country is starting to stand for. Then he steps further onto the crazy train by perpetuating the myth that the United States is pushing for a  New World Order.  He doesn t seem to realize that he isn t forced to pledge allegiance to the flag, nor that there is separation of church and state that protects the church as much as it protects the state. He said: The problem with making an oath or pledge or affirmation is that you might sit there and pledge allegiance, right? And then, like, 30 years later, what happens when that country is a totally different place? What happens when that country stands for something totally different? And you ve already pledged allegiance to it. I mean, we don t want to do that. We don t want to get wrapped up in that. Sure, but he doesn t seem to have a problem pledging allegiance to an archaic text that was written thousands of years ago by men who claim the are writing the word of God. It s more than fine to believe in the Bible. It s more than fine to believe in God. That s his freedom that is protected under the Constitution of the United States. He s allowed to worship freely under full protection of the law as so long as he doesn t harm anyone. So, before he goes and swears off our  earthly government  he should probably think long and hard about the fact that freedom is granted to all, not just some.

Last year, he called a reporter by a gay slur.In normal political times, Baldwin s lack of political experience, along with his caught-on-tape controversies, would be an immediate deal breaker, but these are not normal times.

He quickly granted a restraining order against the release of the videos. Did anyone else think it was really fast and very unusual that a judge would take such swift action? Well, we thought so too and now we know why. Orrick is an Obama appointee and was a bundler for the Obama campaign!A federal judge late Friday granted a temporary restraining order against the release of recordings made at an annual meeting of abortion providers. The injunction is against the Center for Medical Progress, the group that has unveiled Planned Parenthood s participation in the sale of organs harvested from aborted children.Judge William H. Orrick, III, granted the injunction just hours after the order was requested by the National Abortion Federation.Orrick was nominated to his position by hardline abortion supporter President Barack Obama. He was also a major donor to and bundler for President Obama s presidential campaign. He raised at least $200,000 for Obama and donated $30,800 to committees supporting him, according to Public Citizen.Even though the National Abortion Federation filed its claim only hours before, Orrick quickly decided in their favor that the abortionists they represent would, ironically, be  likely to suffer irreparable injury, absent an ex parte temporary restraining order, in the form of harassment, intimidation, violence, invasion of privacy, and injury to reputation, and the requested relief is in the public interest.

"Aug 1, 2017","The Trump administration is preparing to redirect resources of the Justice Department s civil rights division toward investigating and suing universities over affirmative action admissions policies deemed to discriminate against white applicants, according to a document obtained by The New York Times.The document, an internal announcement to the civil rights division, seeks current lawyers interested in working for a new project on  investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions. The announcement suggests that the project will be run out of the division s front office, where the Trump administration s political appointees work, rather than its Educational Opportunities Section, which is run by career civil servants and normally handles work involving schools and universities.The document does not explicitly identify whom the Justice Department considers at risk of discrimination because of affirmative action admissions policies. But the phrasing it uses,  intentional race-based discrimination,  cuts to the heart of programs designed to bring more minorities to university campuses.Supporters and critics of the project said it was clearly targeting admissions programs that can give members of generally disadvantaged groups, like black and Latino students, an edge over other applicants with comparable or higher test scores.For entire story: NYT sIs it legal for colleges and universities to use race as a deciding factor for purposes of admission? In 1997, one brave student took on the University of Michigan and their unfair practice of making the race of the student applicant a much higher priority than the accomplishments of the student when making admission decisions. Meanwhile, a second lawsuit on behalf of Barbara Grutter against the University of Michigan Law was also filed. Both Gratz and Grutter s cases  ended up in the US Supreme Court.Here s what happened:In 2003, the Supreme Court decided the landmark cases of Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger. Several years after CIR s historic victory in the Fifth Circuit, Hopwood v. Texas, which struck down the use of racial preferences in all states in the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit court of Appeals upheld the use of the racial preferences program at the University of Michigan. Because of the contrary conclusions of law reached by the Circuit Courts, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.CIR successfully urged the Supreme Court to strike down the racial preferences system at the University of Michigan s College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, but the Court left the door open for universities to continue using racial preferences under narrow circumstances and allowed the University of Michigan s law school to continue its practice of utilizing race-based admissions.Jennifer Gratz applied to the University of Michigan s undergraduate College of Literature, Arts, and Sciences in 1994, when she was still a high-school senior in a suburb of Detroit. In high-school, she worked as a math tutor, a cheerleader, and served as her Class Congress Representative. She scored 25 on the ACT (in the 83rd percentile) and graduated high-school with a 3.765 GPA. Despite these accomplishments, Gratz was put on a waitlist before ultimately being denied admission to the University.At the time Gratz applied, the University analyzed prospective applicants under a grid system. Gratz combined ACT/GPA scores placed her just outside the  presumptive admit  portion of the grid used to analyze her results. However, the University had a separate grid for analyzing potential applicants it considered  underrepresented minorities.  On this second grid, Gratz s score placed her far above the minimum threshold of automatic admission.On their own merit, Gratz s achievements gave her a competitive chance of gaining admission. But if the University had considered Gratz as a favored minority applicant, she would have had a 100% chance of gaining acceptance. For Gratz, race was the difference between rejection and acceptance.Two years after Jennifer Gratz was rejected from the University of Michigan undergraduate program, Barbara Grutter applied to the University Of Michigan School Of Law. Barbara Grutter had graduated from Michigan State University in 1978 with high honors and a 3.81 GPA. Even though she scored a 161 on the LSAT, Grutter postponed a Law School career to start a successful health care information firm.In 1996, at age forty-three, Grutter returned to pursue her ambitions of attending law school. Despite a life-long record of achievement, Grutter was wait-listed and eventually denied admission to the University of Michigan Law School.Like the undergraduate admissions process, the Law School used a grid system to evaluate potential candidates for admission. A white female applicant with Barbara Grutter s scores had less than a 9% chance of admission on the grid. However, under the same system, a favored minority applicant with the same scores had a 100% chance of gaining admission. As with Gratz, Grutter s race was ultimately the difference between automatic acceptance and automatic rejection.Lawsuits FiledIn 1997, CIR filed a lawsuit on behalf of Jennifer Gratz against the University of Michigan s undergraduate admission system, and a second lawsuit on behalf of Barbara Grutter against the University of Michigan Law School. Combined with CIR s recent victory in Hopwood v. Texas, these challenges made it substantially more likely that the Supreme Court would take the case.CIR argued that the University violated the Fourteenth Amendment s promise of equal protection by discriminating against Gratz and Grutter. Neither institution could profer a compelling justification for the discrimination, nor could they argue that the system of racial preferences was narrowly tailored to avoid harming students like Gratz and Grutter.In light of the ongoing lawsuits, the University of Michigan changes its admission system. The undergraduate school abandoned the grid system in favor of a points system. Under the new system, an application to the school could score a maximum of 150 points. The higher the number of points, the more likely an applicant would be admitted.The method in which points were allotted made race a decisive factor in the admission process. If the University considered an applicant an underrepresented minority, the applicant was awarded an automatic twenty points, or one-fifth of the total points needed to guarantee admission. The University did not weigh any other factors or considerations as heavily as race. The resulting method meant that an applicant with extraordinary artistic talent could only be awarded a maximum of five points for his talent, while another applicant could receive twenty points by virtue of belonging to a certain racial group.This mechanical method of assigning points based on outward characteristics alone, is a prime example of what Shelby Steele called  the disappearance of the black individual.  In his classic essay for Harper s magazine, Steele lamented that institutions, like the University of Michigan, failed to treat African Americans as individuals with real accomplishments. These institutions, Steel argued, cared more for their own image than they did for helping individual African-Americans.District Court VictoriesCIR s two cases were heard by different judges in the District Court. In Gratz, Judge Duggan ruled that the grid system under which Jennifer Gratz had been rejected was unconstitutional, but that the points system in place since then was a justified means of attaining a diverse student body.In Grutter, Judge Bernard Friedman issued a more direct and clear cut victory for CIR and Barbara Grutter. Judge Friedman held, in accordance with Hopwood v. Texas, that diversity is not a compelling government justification for discrimination. The court accordingly struck down the Law School s race-based admissions system.The University of Michigan appealed both cases, and a divided en banc panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Grutter s victory at the district court and held that the University was justified in using racial preferences to achieve diversity. The Sixth Circuit never issued a ruling in Gratz.The Supreme CourtAfter the Sixth Circuit loss in Grutter, CIR petitioned the Supreme Court, asking them to hear both cases as they presented an urgent question of constitutional law. The Court agreed and handed down decisions in June of 2003.Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court in Gratz, struck down the University of Michigan s undergraduate admissions system. Justice Rehnquist reasoned that the points system, assigning points based on outward characteristics, treated applicants in a manner that prized their race over their individual accomplishments. The failure of the University to treat applicants as individuals constituted a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.In Grutter, however, Justice Sandra Day O Connor upheld the Law School admissions system and reasoned that fostering diversity in higher education is a compelling government interest. Justice O Connor argued that a distinction could be made between the mechanical racial preferences used in the undergraduate system and the racial preferences employed by the law school. Essentially doing away with the strict scrutiny analysis that racial classifications require, Justice O Connor deferred to the law school to determine whether racial preferences are necessary. The Court did, however, limit the legality of racial preferences to a period of twenty-five years, when the government will no longer have a a compelling justification to foster diversity.Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the ruling, agreed that racial preferences would be unconstitutional in twenty-five years. However, he also argued that what is unconstitutional twenty-five years from now is also unconstitutional today. Either the Constitution forbids the use of racial discrimination or it does not.While the combined cases of Gratz and Grutter failed to end the government s use of racial preferences, it achieved the minor victory of placing limits on when and how the government may use such preferences.Gratz and Grutter are not the end of the story. CIR s client, Jennifer Gratz, was later able to end racial preferences at the University of Michigan by leading the effort to pass an amendment to the Michigan constitution that banned the use of racial preferences. When an activist group challenged the constitutionality of the amendment, CIR once again came to the aid of Jennifer Gratz. In Schuette v. Bamn, CIR successfully defended the amendment before the Supreme Court. Read more about that case here.Furthermore, almost twelve years after the Supreme Court decided Gratz and Grutter, the issue is once again back before the Supreme Court in the case Fisher v. University of Texas. CIR has filed two amicus briefs before the Supreme Court in that case that urge the Supreme Court to apply the strict scrutiny that Justice O Connor failed to apply in Grutter. In an initial opinion, Justice Kennedy agreed with CIR and ruled that even after Grutter courts may not punt on applying rigid constitutional analysis. After being remanded to the Fifth Circuit, that case is once again before the Supreme Court. Read more about CIR s ongoing efforts to challenge racial preferences in Fisher here.

"Aug 10, 2016","For anyone who thinks Trump s comments have crossed over the line, perhaps they ve forgotten about the Obama supported  Arab Spring  in Egypt that resulted in the violent overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak who was replaced by the radical Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi. And that s just one example Donald Trump accused President Barack Obama on Wednesday of founding the Islamic State group that is wreaking havoc from the Middle East to European cities. A moment later, on another topic, he referred to the president by his full legal name: Barack Hussein Obama. In many respects, you know, they honor President Obama,  Trump said during a raucous campaign rally outside Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  He is the founder of ISIS. He repeated the allegation three more times for emphasis.The Republican presidential nominee in the past has accused his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, of founding the militant group. As he shifted the blame to Obama on Wednesday, he said  crooked Hillary Clinton  was actually the group s co-founder.Trump has long blamed Obama and his former secretary of state   Clinton   for pursuing Mideast policies that created a power vacuum in Iraq that was exploited by IS, another acronym for the group. He s sharply criticized Obama for announcing he would pull U.S. troops out of Iraq, a decision that many Obama critics say created the kind of instability in which extremist groups like IS thrive.The White House declined to comment on Trump s accusation.The Islamic State group began as Iraq s local affiliate of al-Qaida, the group that attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. The group carried out massive attacks against Iraq s Shiite Muslim majority, fueling tensions with al-Qaida s central leadership. The local group s then-leader, Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in 2006 in a U.S. airstrike but is still seen as the Islamic State group s founder.Trump s accusation   and his use of the president s middle name, Hussein   echoed previous instances where he s questioned Obama s loyalties.In June, when a shooter who claimed allegiance to IS killed 49 people in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub, Trump seemed to suggest Obama was sympathetic to the group when he said Obama  doesn t get it, or he gets it better than anybody understands.  In the past, Trump has also falsely suggested Obama is a Muslim or was born in Kenya, where Obama s father was from.

"Aug 11, 2016","The NFL was able to take a stand when it comes to the Cowboys attempt to honoring slain police officers in their hometown, but when an NFL player posts an  ISIS type execution of a police officer on social media, they can t seem to find their voice to express their disapproval The NFL has denied the Dallas Cowboys  request to wear the  Arm-in-Arm  decal on their helmets for Saturday s preseason opener against the Los Angeles Rams.The Cowboys had unveiled the decal at an emotional start to their first padded practice of training camp, when they walked arm-in-arm on the field with Dallas police officials, including police chief David Brown, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings and the families of the police officers slain in the line of duty last month.The Cowboys, who wear the decal on their helmets during training camp, knew they would not be able to wear the decal for the regular season but had hoped to wear it in the preseason. We certainly understand the position the league takes on this, but it won t diminish our support for that concept of unity and supporting our police force and what they do to make our lives better on a daily basis,  coach Jason Garrett said.  That arm-in-arm image is something that we really believe in. You heard me talk about it a couple weeks back. What we re trying to do as a football team is build a team that s close. We talk a lot about unity and having each other s backs, and certainly they embody that. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has this to say about the decal controversy:Tight end Jason Witten spearheaded the idea of the players honoring the police and the families. While a little disappointed, Witten believes the gesture at the start of camp can have a long-lasting impact. What s really important is what we tried to do, and that s to unite that community, our community, and show that support for those families and really honor the leadership of our city,  Witten said.  I think that decal not being on the helmet is not going to stop that. It s going to continue to do that not only now but in the future as we move forward. As players and an organization that is something we re going to continue to support.    ESPNWe reported about Cleveland Brown s player, Isaiah Crowell s Instagram post on July 11, 2016. While Cleveland Brown s acknowledged his post, the NFL has yet to make a public admonishment or levy a fine against him for making what was akin to a terrorist threat on social media against law enforcement.Here is a screen shot of the Instagram post that Crowell posted and then removed:Under the vile picture he posted in ebonics:  They give polices all types of weapons and they continuously choose to kill us. 100percentfedup.comCleveland Police force was not taking this lightly. Here s how they replied to Crowell s vile post:Crowell got blasted for posting an illustration last week of a cop getting his throat slashed by a masked person. He posted it on Wednesday   after Alton Sterling and Philando Castile s deaths, but the day before 5 Dallas officers were shot and killed. The running back deleted the post and the Browns demanded he publicly apologize, which he did.But Stephen Loomis, President of Cleveland Police Patrolmen s Association, thinks the  store-bought apology  isn t enough.  He needs to go to Dallas, help the families who lost their loved ones last week, write them a check, look them in the eyes and give a heartfelt apology. Loomis says Crowell s post was as  offensive as putting a picture of historical African-American men being hung from a tree in the 60s.  He adds that if Crowell doesn t go to Dallas and make a donation,  I will pull Cleveland officers, sheriffs, state troopers out of First Energy Stadium this season if he doesn t make it right. As for Crowell admitting he was wrong and acted out of rage   Loomis says,  You re a grown ass man, and you claim you were too emotional to know it was wrong? Think we ll accept your apology?

And as a believing Christian, I m especially offended because anybody who believes The Bible, especially the gospels, will have to accept that there is no way that God is a respecter of persons- as scripture makes clear, He doesn t love some people more than others because of their color, because of their affiliation, even with Him. He mentioned that because he believe in the gospels that  every person has equal worth,  that makes him pro-life.Pirro asked Huckabee if the outrage over the president s remarks are just  Trump haters  who   will look for any reason to dump on  him.

THE LIST OF VACATIONS IS LONG The figures for the Martha s Vineyard vacations in the past have shown the cost for Air Force One alone to be multiple millions:Judicial Watch has been great at getting the numbers: The outbound flight to Martha s Vineyard for the Obama family August vacation cost taxpayers $890,323.20. The return flight to Washington was $273,945.60. The total price for flight expenditures alone came to $1,164,268.80.It has been reported that the Obamas have made a point of contributing to the cost of these taxpayer-funded trips, and have reportedly paid for the rental costs of the estate in the past. The kicker is that just for Air Force One incurred flight costs in 2013  it was a grand total of $7,396,531.20. DON T GET ME WRONG, EVERYONE NEEDS A VACATION IT S JUST THAT THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS WIFE ARE WAAAAY OVER THE TOPPresident Obama and his family are currently residing in a $22.5 million vacation home complete with six bedrooms, five bathrooms, and two half-bathrooms on the island of Martha s Vineyard, Massachusetts.The Huffington Post reported that the nearly 7000-square-foot Chilmark mansion, positioned on nine-and-a-half-acres, houses a sunken living room with double-height windowed walls that allow the first family a view of the heated infinity pool.It also features an oversized wood-burning fireplace, though temperatures on the island currently reach up to 80 degrees.Despite the estate s amenities, Obama has been spending plenty of time on the golf course.

"Aug 13, 2016","Hillary Clinton tells about funding the terrorists who would help defeat the Russians   most of this is true but in typical Hillary fashion she changes the story and doesn t mention Reagan s Strategic Defense Initiative. The SDI aka  Star Wars  was a big part in the defeat as well. You can guarantee you ll never see this video clip on the main stream media! During the 1970 s the CIA used the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt as a barrier, both to thwart Soviet expansion and prevent the spread of Marxist ideology among the Arab masses. The United States also openly supported Sarekat Islam against Sukarno in Indonesia, and supported the Jamaat-e-Islami terror group against Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in Pakistan. Last but certainly not least, there is Al Qaeda.Lest we forget, the CIA gave birth to Osama Bin Laden and breastfed his organization during the 1980 s. Former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, told the House of Commons that Al Qaeda was unquestionably a product of Western intelligence agencies. Mr. Cook explained that Al Qaeda, which literally means an abbreviation of  the database  in Arabic, was originally the computer database of the thousands of Islamist extremists, who were trained by the CIA and funded by the Saudis, in order to defeat the Russians in Afghanistan.America s relationship with Al Qaeda has always been a love-hate affair. Depending on whether a particular Al Qaeda terrorist group in a given region furthers American interests or not, the U.S. State Department either funds or aggressively targets that terrorist group. Even as American foreign policy makers claim to oppose Muslim extremism, they knowingly foment it as a weapon of foreign policy.The Islamic State is its latest weapon that, much like Al Qaeda, is certainly backfiring. ISIS recently rose to international prominence after its thugs began beheading American journalists. Now the terrorist group controls an area the size of the United Kingdom.In order to understand why the Islamic State has grown and flourished so quickly, one has to take a look at the organization s American-backed roots. The 2003 American invasion and occupation of Iraq created the pre-conditions for radical Sunni groups, like ISIS, to take root. America, rather unwisely, destroyed Saddam Hussein s secular state machinery and replaced it with a predominantly Shiite administration. The U.S. occupation caused vast unemployment in Sunni areas, by rejecting socialism and closing down factories in the naive hope that the magical hand of the free market would create jobs.FLASHBACK: Hillary Clinton Received Secret Memo Stating Obama Admin Support for ISISUnder the new U.S.-backed Shiite regime, working class Sunni s lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. Unlike the white Afrikaners in South Africa, who were allowed to keep their wealth after regime change, upper class Sunni s were systematically dispossessed of their assets and lost their political influence. Rather than promoting religious integration and unity, American policy in Iraq exacerbated sectarian divisions and created a fertile breading ground for Sunni discontent, from which Al Qaeda in Iraq took root.The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) used to have a different name: Al Qaeda in Iraq. After 2010 the group rebranded and refocused its efforts on Syria.Via: GR",WOW! HILLARY SPILLS THE BEANS On Funding Terrorists…The Press Is Silent [Video]

However, PRB claims that the threat posed by the 43-year-old, Sufiyan Barhoumi, can be  adequately mitigated,  in part due to  his lack of extremist views. At one point, the Pentagon deemed the prisoner to be  high risk,  linked to key al Qaeda leadership, and accused him of participating in  hostilities against the US and coalition forces.

You guessed it, the Senators from those two states are not having any of it! Remember when Obama tried this 7 years ago? It didn t go over well then but it seems desperation has kicked in and he s trying to dump the GITMO prisoners in states again. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Pat Roberts of Kansas are up in arms about reports that the Pentagon is scouting sites in their home states to house terrorist prisoners currently detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We have received reports of President Obama s attempt to shut down Guantanamo Bay, which once again reflects another egregious overstep by this administration,  Roberts said in a statement on Friday, referring to the law preventing transferring any of the inmates to a U.S. prison. Congress has consistently stopped Obama by law from moving a single detainee to the U.S.,  Roberts said in reaction to reports that Kansas s Fort Leavenworth is being considered as the terrorist suspects  new home. I shut down this administration s nominee for secretary of the Army in 2009 to prevent moving any detainees to Kansas and will do it again if necessary,  he said.  Not on my watch will any terrorist be placed in Kansas. Graham was equally emphatic upon learning that Defense Secretary Ash Carter is also considering Charleston for the new high-risk installation. If the detainees need to be moved, they must be moved to a maximum security location in a remote area far from heavily populated areas with vital infrastructure,  Graham told the Washington Post earlier this week.  Charleston does not meet that criteria. The Pentagon on Thursday confirmed to lawmakers that it is studying both Forth Leavenworth and the Consolidated Naval Brig in Charleston as potential sites.Via: WE ",SENATORS UP IN ARMS OVER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO MOVE GITMO TO TWO DIFFERENT STATES

So again, I m not as concerned with what 45 is doing, I m more concerned with us progressing as a community.CHRIS CUOMO: Wes, quick question. Why do you refer to the president as 45? Yes, he is the 45th president, but is that intentional, or is that just a quick term.BELLAMY: Well, that s just what I call him. I believe that when he begins to act as if he deserves to be in that office, and leads in terms of unifying people, then he will deserve the name of President Trump. But at this point, I believe that he has not done the things in regards to bringing this country together, he has not done the things in regards to making us a more unified place. Nor has he decided to condemn the individuals in a rapid pace, or as he should, or speak out in the way we believe he should. But again, I m not here to talk about 45.BELLAMY IS A KNOWN RACIST BUT CBS IS COMPLICIT WITH THEIR DESIRE TO CENSOR BELLAMY S RACIST TWEETS: CBS reporter Jan Crawford interviewed BELLAMY in her April 13 Evening News segment about the Robert E. Lee statue at the center of Charlottesville  controversy. Crawford downplayed the racist comments and made no mention of Bellamy s punishment for the disgusting tweets he sent (see below) His past tweets suggest that he was part of the race problem. But CBS purposefully minimized his history, shifting the blame onto the vice mayor s opponents.  Supporters of the statue unearth crude tweets written by Bellamy as a younger man,  Crawford noted,  and he also was targeted with death threats, but Bellamy feels his fight is justified. Just what kinds of  crude  things did Bellamy say? There were racist tweets, such as his comment in 2009:  I DON T LIK WHIT PEOPLE SO I HATE WHITE SNOW!!!!! FML!!!!  And his 2010 tweet:  I really #hate how almost 80% of the black people here talk white. There were inappropriate and crude tweets. The same year, he tweeted:  ALRIGHT. My phone goin ham. Lol.

"Aug 16, 2015","Remember the promise of a fence on our southern border? Yes, it was the plan but the $1.2 billion dollar plan was never executed as proposed. You can thank Obama and a popular Republican for that WE RECENTLY POSTED THIS VIDEO OF AN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL SAYING BUILDING A BORDER FENCE  ISN T POSSIBLE  EVEN THOUGH $1.2 BILLION WAS GIVEN IN 2006 FOR A FENCE:  In his speech in El Paso on immigration reform on May 10, 2011, Obama declared that the fence along the border with Mexico is  now basically complete.  Like much of what comes out of the Obama administration, that was a lie. What was supposed to be built was a double layered fence with barbed-wire on top, and room for a security vehicle to patrol between the layers. Except for 36 of the seven-hundred mile fence, what was built looks like the picture above or the one below.OBAMA CLAIMED: We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement,  Obama said.  All the stuff they asked for, we ve done. But even though we ve answered these concerns, I ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time. Maybe he s right the goal posts were moved, but to make the job easier.THE  SECURE FENCE ACT The Secure Fence Act was introduced on Sept. 13, 2006 by Rep Peter King (R-NY) and passed Congress on a bi-partisan basis. In the House of Representatives, the Fence Act passed 283 -138 on September 14, 2006. On September 29, 2006, the Fence Act passed in the Senate 80 -19. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 s goal was to help secure America s borders to decrease illegal entry, drug trafficking, and security threats by building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers along the Mexico-United States border. Additionally, the law authorized more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting as well as authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology such as cameras, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce infrastructure at the border. So far less than 40 miles of a real fence have been built   most of it during the Bush Administration.Of the almost 700 miles of fencing, DHS reports there are currently 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing, as the bill required, the kind with enough gap that you can drive a vehicle between the layers. But the majority of the fencing erected has been made from vehicle barriers with single-layer pedestrian fencing, the kind of barriers that are designed to stop vehicles rather than people. The design specifications vary, depending on geography and climate characteristics, but according to the Customs and Border Patrol website, those include  post on rail  steel set in concrete; steel picket-style fence set in concrete; vehicle bollards similar to those found around federal buildings;  Normandy; vehicle fence consisting of steel beams; and concrete jersey walls with steel mesh.PROMINENT REPUBLICAN FROM TEXAS:The first blow against the promised fence was made by Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican Senator from Texas, at the urging of DHS she proposed an amendment to give the Department discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read,  Nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.  Hutchison s amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007 despite the fact that Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., had a cow he argued the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill, he was right. Hutchison s intentions may have been honorable, but she didn t foresee Barack Obama being the next president.When Janet Napolitano became Obama s first DHS she took advantage of Ms. Hutchison s 2007 amendment, instead of building a fence which look something like the below, she built a fence that was mostly a combination of the two pictures above.When She was still Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano said,  You show me a 50-foot wall, and I ll show you a 51-foot ladder at the border. And she may be right The fence will never STOP all illegal crossings. The purpose of the fence is two-fold, slowing the intruders and making them visible to members of the border patrol. The rest of the work is done by human beings.Very little of the Israeli separation barrier erected to keep out terrorists is a wall, most of the 400 miles of the barrier which has received so much international scorn is a two layered fence like section of their barrier below. The fence has served its purpose, in 2002, the year before construction started, 457 Israelis were murdered; in 2009, 8 Israelis were killed.The reason it has been effective is not simply the fence itself but how the fence is guarded and patrolled. And that s what will make our fence along the Mexican border work.Here s the bottom line. Back in 2006 the people of the U.S. were promised a border fence. Since then thanks to Kay Bailey Hutchison and Barack Obama 95% of the fence wasn t built. The arguments against the fence are bogus especially if you look at Israel s history. It s time for America to demand that its leaders build the fence they promised. No one can honestly say it wont work, after all it hasn t been tried.

Oh yeah that was Bill Clinton who was actually IMPEACHED for LYING to a grand jury. Is there a more corrupt, self-serving power-driven couple in America?  WASHINGTON, D.C. Today, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (UT-03) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (VA-06) sent a letter to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia requesting an investigation into whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton committed perjury and made false statements when testifying under oath before Congress.The letter states: The evidence collected by the FBI during its investigation of Secretary Clinton s use of a personal email system appears to directly contradict several aspects of her sworn testimony. In light of those contradictions, the Department should investigate and determine whether to prosecute Secretary Clinton for violating statutes that prohibit perjury and false statements to Congress, or any other relevant statutes. Background:During a July 5, 2016 hearing before the House Oversight Committee, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey stated the truthfulness of Secretary Clinton s testimony before Congress was not within the scope of the FBI s investigation. According to Director Comey the Department of Justice requires a criminal referral from Congress to initiate an investigation into Secretary Clinton s congressional testimony.Additionally, Chairman Chaffetz sent a letter to Director Comey requesting the FBI s full investigative file from its review of former Secretary Clinton s use of an authorized private email server.Chairman Goodlatte sent a letter to Director Comey pressing for more information about the FBI s investigation and also led a letter signed by over 200 members of Congress demanding answers from FBI Director Comey regarding the many questions surrounding his announcement that he does not recommend federal prosecution against former Secretary Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information through private email servers.Full text of letter:The Honorable Channing D. Phillips U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia 555 Fourth Street NW Washington, D.C. 20530Dear Mr. Phillips:We write to request an investigation to determine whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton committed perjury and made false statements during her testimony under oath before congressional committees.While testifying before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on July 7, 2016, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey stated the truthfulness of Secretary Clinton s testimony before Congress was not within the scope of the FBI s investigation. Nor had the FBI even considered any of Secretary Clinton s testimony. Director Comey further testified the Department of Justice requires a criminal referral from Congress to initiate an investigation of Secretary Clinton s congressional testimony.

"Aug 16, 2017","Mainstream news channels rarely draw attention to the negative side of abortion, but CBS News did so this week with a report about Iceland s near 100-percent abortion rate for babies with Down syndrome.  few countries have come as close to eradicating Down syndrome births as Iceland,  the report begins.  Since prenatal screening tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, the vast majority of women   close to 100 percent   who received a positive test for Down syndrome terminated their pregnancy. Just a handful of children with Down syndrome have been born in Iceland in the past decade. Two are born each year, on average, but the rest are killed in the womb. For most of the children who were born, their mothers decided not to have prenatal screening tests.This deadly discrimination against babies with disabilities is a problem in countries across the world, not just Iceland. In 2014, the Danish government reported 98 percent of unborn babies who tested positive for Down syndrome were aborted. CBS reports the rate in France was 77 percent in 2015, 90 percent in the United Kingdom and 67 percent in the U.S. between 1995 and 2011. Some put the rate even higher in the United States, but it is difficult to determine the exact number because the U.S. government does not keep detailed statistics about abortion.In many of these countries, late-term abortions are legal in cases of fetal anomalies, such as Down syndrome. The UK, for example, prohibits abortions after 24 weeks but allows wide exceptions for late-term abortions involving fetal anomalies.Iceland hospital counselor Helga Sol Olafsdottir does not see any problem with the fact that so many women are having their unborn babies aborted because of Down syndrome. This systematic discrimination is simply a  woman s choice  in her mind.The issue is not gray. It s very clearly wrong, says Penny Nace, president and CEO of Concerned Women for America. This is eugenics and barbarianism at best,  Nace said.  These individuals have no less worth than anyone else. Iceland and many other countries are killing human beings in abortions simply because they have a disability. Down syndrome varies in severity, but most people with the genetic disorder live into their 60s. Some even live on their own, hold down jobs, go to college and get married.For entire story   Life News",ICELAND PROUDLY CLAIMS TO HAVE “ERADICATED” Down Syndrome…In Most Gruesome Way Imaginable
"Aug 17, 2015","This is another twist and turn in the mega scandal that is all Hillary s mess. The interesting thing about this e-mail discovery is that Philippe Reines had been battling with reporters in March via e-mail regarding guilt or innocence in this e-mail scandal:A key member of Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton s team sent several angry emails to a group of journalists on Tuesday night. The messages criticized a source for being a  lying liar  and what the aide described as a reporter s  cockamamie theory. Fast Forward to this new development: State Department officials have uncovered thousands of emails between Philippe Reines, a top Hillary Clinton aide, and members of the media, they previously said did not exist.In a court filing last Thursday, the State Department estimated that a recent search turned up more than 81,000 emails from Reines s official account while at the State Department. And 17,855 potentially fall within a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by Gawker earlier this year.That is a reversal from 2013, when the State Department said a thorough search turned up no responsive records for Gawker s request. In 2012, Gawker requested all emails between Reines and reporters from 34 media outlets.The State Department did not explain the reversal in the court document, nor did it return a request for comment.It will begin releasing a tranche of Reines s emails by the end of September.After it was revealed earlier this year that Clinton, and potentially some of her aides, used personal email accounts for official business, Gawker sued the State Department over its initial request for communications between Reines and reporters.Via: The Hill",OOPS!

"Aug 17, 2016","Vice Presidential candidate Tim Kaine has some explaining to do! It sure looks like he sold his soul to the Clintons to run as Vice President. He had a totally different view of Bill Clinton in 2002 and stated he thought Bill should have stepped down during the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. The lack of integrity and lack of respect for the office that Bill Clinton held should be enough for any Democrat to not want him anywhere near the White House again. Clinton shook his finger as he looked in the camera and LIED  to the American people about his disgusting affair with a White House intern. Does anyone care to recall that this was a HUGE DEAL AND NOW HIS ENABLING WIFE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT! This all seems so impossible but the press, globalists and Republican elitists are making it possible Do what you can to keep the Clinton Grifters out of the White House. America deserves better! TRUMP 2016!  How quickly Democrats forget! Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine is pretty much part of the Clinton family at this point. But in 2002, he said Bill Clinton should have stepped down in the wake of his affair with a White House intern.Bill Clinton should have resigned over the Monica Lewinsky scandal at least, that s a view Tim Kaine once held.Kaine s remark reported 14 years ago in the Richmond Times-Dispatch in the aftermath of a state-level sex scandal hasn t drawn any attention thus far in the 2016 presidential cycle. But it suggests Hillary Clinton s running mate at one point harbored reservations about the integrity of the man poised to become the country s first first gentleman.Kaine commented on the Lewinsky scandal in 2002, when allegations of sexual harassment had rocked the Virginia House of Delegates. The speaker of the house, Vance Wilkins, was a Republican power broker who had just helped his party flip the House and build its majority after Democrats had historically controlled the chamber.Just one problem: Earlier in 2001, Wilkins agreed to pay $100,000 in hush money to a former female employee at his construction company who said he sexually harassed her.The woman, Jennifer Thompson, alleged privately that Wilkins groped her and pinned her against office furniture. She considered pressing charges, according to a Washington Post report that broke the news on June 7, 2002. But she ultimately decided not to, accepting the $100,000 from Wilkins and signing a confidentiality agreement. The Post cited  sources familiar with the settlement  in their report on it. Wilkins held and still holds, as he stated in an interview with The Daily Beast that he didn t sexually harass Thompson, and that he only paid her to keep her allegations from becoming a scandal that would have undermined Republicans  efforts to control the House.The Post s report caused an immediate firestorm, and top Republicans called for Wilkins to resign. Jerry Kilgore, then the state s attorney general and top-ranking elected Republican, joined the chorus.So did Tim Kaine, who was the state s lieutenant governor at the time. And according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, he said he also believed Bill Clinton should have resigned from the presidency over his own sex scandals.Here s what the paper wrote, in a story published June 8, 2002: If the allegations are true, he should definitely resign,  Kaine said, adding he held the same view about President Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.  That is an intolerable way to treat women and it s not something that the state should be dragged through. The Times-Dispatch story is behind a paywall in its archive.A report in The Washington Post, also published on June 8, 2002, characterized his views the same way:Lt. Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D), who may face [state Attorney General Jerry] Kilgore in the 2005 governor s race, likened the matter to the sexual scandal of President Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, saying,  If the allegations are true, he ought to resign. Somebody in public life shouldn t behave that way toward women,  Kaine said.  It s tawdry. It s not the leadership that Virginia should have. An AP story that ran on the same day also highlighted Kaine s criticism of Bill Clinton. When I read it this morning, my reaction was the same I had when I read about the Clinton-Lewinsky affair: this is not appropriate conduct. It s beneath the dignity of the office,  he said.Amy Dudley, a spokesperson for Kaine, said the Virginia senator is focused on the future. As the Associated Press reported at the time, Kaine characterized President Clinton s actions as  not appropriate  conduct, but he had previously been on record criticizing the impeachment effort,  she said.  He believes this election is about Hillary Clinton s vision to make historic investments to create good paying jobs, make college debt free and build an economy that works for everyone, not re-litigating personal issues from the distant past. Wilkins told The Daily Beast that he didn t recall Kaine making the comment, but that he  didn t pay much attention to him anyway. He saw a political opportunity to make a political hit and he took it,  Wilkins added.  It doesn t surprise me at all. Kaine wasn t the only Democrat disturbed by Bill Clinton s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton s world-famous lie I did not have sexual relations with that woman became one of the definitive lines of the  90s. And their dalliances ultimately led to the House voting to impeach Clinton. Five House Democrats including Virginian Virgil Goode, who later became a Republican voted for some of the articles of impeachment. No Senate Democrats voted that Clinton was guilty.

"Aug 18, 2016","Hillary Clinton is a Planned Parenthood s champion. She was greeted like a rock star at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund event in June, 2016. She mocked Donald Trump s defense of life, while highlighting her undying support for destroying the life of the most vulnerable. She s been bending over backwards to pander to Blacks for their votes, while trying desperately to gain the confidence of the Black Lives Matter movement. But isn t Hillary s concern for Black lives just another one of her lies? She is the darling of Planned Parenthood after all, and their stated goal has always been to kill off the Black population? Finally, a prominent Black professional athlete is speaking out and telling the truth about the true intentions of this killing machine for profit.Christian NFL player Ben Watson does not hesitate to call out Planned Parenthood s targeting of minority women and their babies for abortions.In a recent interview with Turning Point Pregnancy Resource Center in San Diego, the Baltimore Ravens player talked about the racial divide in America and how it factors into the abortion issue.  abortion saddens me period, but it seems to be something that is really pushed on minorities and provided to minorities especially as something that they should do,  Watson said.He pointed to Planned Parenthood s founder Margaret Sanger and her eugenic push to exterminate people she deemed  unfit.  Today,  it s working,  Watson said. We sit here and talk about advancing the black agenda, whatever that means, we talk about our interests, and what s important to us   like having political power and advancement and all those things   and then we are turning around and we are killing our children,  Watson continued.  And we are buying the lie that it s our personal decision to make. Here s Hillary Clinton slamming Donald Trump over his defense of life and her willingness to destroy it at a Planned Parenthood event:The NFL star said he is sympathetic to the women who are struggling with an unplanned pregnancy. But Watson, a husband and father of five children, said many men are not stepping up to help their children and the women in their lives like they should. He urged men to take responsibility for their actions. He need to be there to support her through the physical changes of the pregnancy, and help and provide emotional strength, and do it together,  Watson continued.  As much as he has a role in making the baby in the first place, it needs to take both of them the whole way through. Sometimes, Watson said he does have the opportunity to talk with other NFL players about abortion and his pro-life convictions. Just like in almost any career setting, Watson said they talk about many different things, including politics and religion. You ve got guys that consider themselves Conservative and pro-life, and you ve got guys that consider themselves Liberal and pro-choice, and it kind of goes back and forth,  he said.  What I love is that in most of the situations I have been in, not all of them, but most, even if we sometimes talk abrasively to each other, we still have love for each other. Last year, after the Center for Medical Progress began releasing its undercover Planned Parenthood videos, Watson wasn t shy about speaking up for unborn babies either.He posted on his Facebook wall:As horrific as it is, the issue isn t really the sale of human parts. It s the legal practice that allows this to even be a possibility. Killing children and simply discarding the leftovers is not any more acceptable than profiting off of them. #PlannedParenthood  Asked if he has faced backlash for his stance, Watson told Turning Point,  I won t say I m not afraid, and I will say that I ve received some flack for some of the things I ve said   I decided that you know, if the spirit of God has prompted me to say something, I m gonna trust in God and say it.

Gatestone Institute An apparent draft of one of the secret side agreements to the Iran nuclear deal indicates that Tehran will be permitted to use its own experts to inspect the Parchin nuclear site believed to have housed nuclear arms development.The Associated Press obtained the document, which an anonymous official described as a draft of an agreement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that does not differ much from the final version. The IAEA is the U.N. agency responsible for ensuring that Tehran abides by the stipulations in the finalized deal.The secret agreements between Iran and the IAEA of which there are at least two have to do with the inspection of Iran s Parchin military facility as well as the extent to which Tehran must admit to the details of its alleged nuclear weapons program.Despite repeated calls from lawmakers, President Obama has refused to provide Congress with the details of the secret deals.The AP reports:Any IAEA member country must give the agency some insight into its nuclear program. Some countries are required to do no more than give a yearly accounting of the nuclear material they possess. But nations like Iran suspected of possible proliferation are under greater scrutiny that can include stringent inspections.But the agreement diverges from normal inspection procedures between the IAEA and a member country by essentially ceding the agency s investigative authority to Iran. It allows Tehran to employ its own experts and equipment in the search for evidence for activities that it has consistently denied trying to develop nuclear weapons.The document suggests that IAEA officials will merely monitor Iranian experts as they inspect the Parchin site and provide the U.N. agency with photos and videos taken only of areas that Iran has not deemed off-limits because of military implications.Iranian technicians are also to perform the sampling of weapons development work, which is limited to seven samples inside the facility building.In the face of criticism, the Obama administration has denied that the nuclear deal is built on the trust of the Iranians.Multiple GOP lawmakers have sounded the alarm regarding the secret agreements between Tehran and the IAEA, accusing Obama of violating the law by denying Congress access to the details of the side deals.Before the final deal was reached in Vienna, Obama signed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which requires congressional lawmakers view all documents of the nuclear agreement specifically including those reached on the  side.

The content of this manual is disturbing and should be read by every American, so we understand what we are up against. It helps to explain why these groups call our President and his supporters  Hitler  or  racists  or  homophobes.  It s not that Trump or his supporters are any of these things, it s just part of a campaign to humiliate and shut down any opposition to radicals whose ultimate goal is a one world order and the destruction of capitalism in America. This manual gives every day Americans a look into the mind of a leftist radical who hates America and everything Americans stand for. They clearly have no regard for free-speech and are willing to use any means necessary, including deceit, outright lies and of course, violence to achieve their ultimate goals of a New World Order.This page explains how Antifa members are to use name-calling as a means to create a culture of tolerance.  When all else fails, compare someone to Hitler.  Next they discuss how to use ones minority status, and to remember that you are  Black first  and  American second.  or  Gay/Lesbian first  and  American third  and so on.It s important to gain control of the media through any means necessary.Some major media conglomerates are swinging to our side, but they have not gone far enough.It s no coincidence that CNN just published a fluff piece on Antifa today: Unmasking the leftist Antifa movementThe CNN piece was clearly written to shed a sympathetic light on the violent group that s been caught attacking and harming so many innocent Americans, many of them were harmed by Antifa for defending free speech and/or our President Donald J.

"Aug 2, 2015","A transcript from the Friday, July 31, 2015 Rush Limbaugh show. Rush is truly one of the most brilliant political analysts of our time. He proves it with this commentary on Mitt Romney and Ted Cruz:RUSH: Mitt Romney is out there ripping into Ted Cruz, and I made the observation that I can t recall a presidential candidate   losing presidential candidate   ripping presidential candidates in his own party in the next election cycle. I was trying to think, in the modern era, if there was an example of it. I couldn t think of one. It wasn t so much trying to think of Reagan s 11th commandment as I was thinking more about establishment Republican versus upstart Tea Party conservative.By the way, here s another thing: I ve been doing  In the course of show prep, I ve been doing just a voluminous amount of reading about the divide here between the establishment in Washington, both parties, and the Republican Party, what s happening with Trump and so forth. Now, I knew! I knew that the Democrats had elevated the Tea Party into being something horrible and giant and bad, negative. I had no idea Eh, that s not quite true. I didn t fully appreciate the extent to which the Republican Party has enmity for the Tea Party. The Washington establishment treats the Tea Party  They re genuinely afraid of it. Let me put it this way: They re genuinely afraid of it because of its size and its power, and the amazing thing about that is the Tea Party is not something about which is organized around an individual. I think this is why they fear it. It is genuinely bottom-up.It s an effervescent movement of average, ordinary people fed up with Washington, just totally fed up with government, totally fed up with what government is doing. Peggy Noonan has a piece today, and she says that the Tea Party and others, it s not hatred for government they have, it s contempt for government. But the Tea Party is genuinely feared, and it s genuinely feared because it is thought to be huge, and it s put the whole Republican establishment on defense.So, anyway, Ted Cruz  isn t backing off the tough rhetoric he s used to describe the Iran nuclear deal, despite criticism leveled by  Mitt Romney yesterday. Cruz  fired back at Romney in a Thursday radio interview   So Mitt Romney s tweet today said,  Gosh, this rhetoric is not helpful,  Cruz said.  John Adams famously said,  Facts are stubborn things.  Describing the actual facts is not using rhetoric; it is called speaking the truth.'  Cruz then fired another fact. Part of the reason that Mitt Romney got clobbered by Barack Obama is because we all remember that third debate where Barack Obama turned to Mitt and said,  I said the Benghazi attack was terrorism and no one is more upset by Benghazi than I am!  And Mitt, I guess listening to his own advice, said,  Well gosh, I don t want to use any rhetoric. So OK, never mind. I ll just kind of rearrange the pencil on the podium here,  Cruz said.  And he s right! We do remember that debate.I mean, Romney must have had three, different, slow-pitch curveballs, softballs, just tailor made for grand-slam home runs, and he just didn t even take a swing at them. Remember that? After the first debate, when Romney just cleaned Obama s clock, do you remember that? The Democrats and the media were all asking,  What happened to Obama? Oh my God, does he even want to be reelected?  They were scared to death because Romney just made mincemeat.After that one, it was like it never happened, almost like Romney felt guilty for doing it. Because he went into a defensive mode and did not do anything else that might offend or upset or irritate anybody. And it was clear that the consultants had gotten hold of him. Maybe they didn t have to. Maybe he believed it himself. But the consultants had gotten a hold of him and said,  Look, you can t keep criticizing the president. The independents don t like that! We re never going to win. We have to show we can cooperate. We have to show we can work with the Democrats!  So Romney shut up. But what Cruz s point is very simple (summarized):  What are you beating up on me for? I m not the enemy. I m not the Democrat Party. Why don t you start talking about them this way? They re the ones actually doing a deal that s going to put this country at risk. Why don t you say that?  Effectively what Cruz is saying is,  I m not the problem here, Mitt! And this isn t  rhetoric.  I m simply citing facts. So now people are starting to ask:  Is Cruz following in the Trump mold? Is Trump serving to show the way for other Republicans how to respond?  Well, maybe Trump is, but Cruz doesn t need to be shown. This is standard operating procedure for Cruz. I mean, it was just two weeks ago that he went to the floor of the Senate and accused the majority leader of lying to him face to face. Now he s firing back at Romney. But try this headline. Well, it s not a headline. It s a paragraph subhead. Both Obama and Romney have called Cruz s remarks inappropriate.  What has Cruz done? He s  maintained that [Obama] would become a leading state-sponsor of terror if the agreement it struck with Iran makes it past Congress. He and others have argued that Iran would use a windfall from sanctions relief to finance terror abroad.  He has said on that basis alone this deal ought not get done! And then Romney piped up and said in a tweet (paraphrased):  Gosh, this rhetoric isn t helpful. Gosh, this rhetoric isn t helpful! Cruz fired back:  You re telling me what s not helpful? You got clobbered by Obama for a reason! You got clobbered because you backed off. You got clobbered because you didn t have the guts to keep going.  So this is  I like this, folks. Whatever Trump s responsible for it or not.END TRANSCRIPTVia: RushLimbaugh.com",ROMNEY CRITICIZES TEA PARTY CANDIDATE TED CRUZ ABOUT TOUGH RHETORIC ON IRAN AND CRUZ COMES OUT SWINGING: “You got clobbered [by Obama] because you didn’t have the guts to keep going.”
"Aug 2, 2016","US Congressman Joe Wilson was right! Obama is a liar His reckless and amateur decisions have made America more unsafe than we have ever been. Now he s asking Americans to vote for Hillary to ensure his lawless legacy lives on The Obama administration secretly organized an airlift of $400 million worth of cash to Iran that coincided with the January release of four Americans detained in Tehran, according to U.S. and European officials and congressional staff briefed on the operation afterward.Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said.The money represented the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a decades-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the 1979 fall of Iran s last monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.The settlement, which resolved claims before an international tribunal in The Hague, also coincided with the formal implementation that same weekend of the landmark nuclear agreement reached between Tehran, the U.S. and other global powers the summer before. With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well,  President Barack Obama said at the White House on Jan. 17 without disclosing the $400 million cash payment.Senior U.S. officials denied any link between the payment and the prisoner exchange. They say the way the various strands came together simultaneously was coincidental, not the result of any quid pro quo. As we ve made clear, the negotiations over the settlement of an outstanding claim were completely separate from the discussions about returning our American citizens home,  State Department spokesman John Kirby said.  Not only were the two negotiations separate, they were conducted by different teams on each side, including, in the case of The Hague claims, by technical experts involved in these negotiations for many years. But U.S. officials also acknowledge that Iranian negotiators on the prisoner exchange said they wanted the cash to show they had gained something tangible.Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and a fierce foe of the Iran nuclear deal, accused President Barack Obama of paying  a $1.7 billion ransom to the ayatollahs for U.S. hostages. This break with longstanding U.S. policy put a price on the head of Americans, and has led Iran to continue its illegal seizures  of Americans, he said.Since the cash shipment, the intelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guard has arrested two more Iranian-Americans. Tehran has also detained dual-nationals from France, Canada and the U.K. in recent months.At the time of the prisoner release, Secretary of State John Kerry and the White House portrayed it as a diplomatic breakthrough. Mr. Kerry cited the importance of  the relationships forged and the diplomatic channels unlocked over the course of the nuclear talks. For entire story: Wall Street JournalAs a bonus, here is Rep.

"Aug 20, 2015","Hillary Clinton is trying to blame the State Department for her lawlessness but new information is coming out showing the destruction of evidence by two Clinton aides. Thank goodness for Judicial Watch and their effort to get to the bottom of this e-mail scandal. Hillary Clinton and two aides appear to have violated two national security laws by sending classified information on a private email server, according to a former Army counterintelligence agent and investigator for a public interest law group.Additionally, the two Clinton aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, disregarded a federal judge s order this month requiring both to make sworn statements to the court that all government documents in their possession will be returned to federal officials, said Chris Farrell, director of investigations for Judicial Watch, the law group. What we have is a secretary of state, the only cabinet official in our history, who established her own private email server   in an effort to avoid the normal protocols for unclassified and classified communications. It s an end run,  he said.Farrell, in a briefing on the Clinton email affair at the Judicial Watch offices, said supporters of Clinton have sought to portray the use of the private email system to send classified information as a minor administrative matter. It is not,  he said.  It is a national security crime, and should be a national security crime investigation,  he said, noting that Clinton created the private email server a week before she took up her duties at Foggy Bottom, indicating that she planned to avoid using official email that must be stored under federal rules.Two laws apply to the mishandling of classified data on unsecure networks, Farrell said.The first is 18 USC Sec. 1924, which outlaws the unauthorized removal and storage of classified information. Penalties can include fines and imprisonment for up to one year.That statute was used to prosecute retired Army General David Petraeus, a former CIA director who provided classified documents to his mistress and biographer, Paula Broadwell. Petraeus was sentenced to two years  probation and a $40,000 fine as part of a plea deal in March.A second federal statute that prosecutors could use to charge Clinton and her aides is 18 USC Sec. 793, a more serious felony statute Farrell described as a  hammer. That law covers national defense information and people who misuse it to injure the United States or benefit a foreign power.Those convicted of violating that law face fines and up to 10 years in prison.Farrell said he that as an Army counterintelligence officer, he has conducted investigations in the past that are similar to the Clinton email probe. He also worked at a special security officer who was in charge of SCIFs special facilities used for handling sensitive intelligence. When it comes the law on these, intent doesn t matter,  Farrell said. Mishandling top-secret information should bring down the full weight of the law on violators, he said.The Clinton email matter is a  serious national security crime issue,  Farrell said.  It s not two agencies fighting over classification after the fact. Judicial Watch currently has 18 lawsuits pending against the State Department seeking access to records under the Freedom of Information Act. THE CLINTON E-MAIL SCANDAL EXPLAINED IN 2 1/2 MINUTES: A hearing on one of the lawsuits is set for Thursday before Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who recently ordered Clinton, Abedin, and Mills to make the sworn statements regarding federal documents in their possession.According to Farrell, only Clinton supplied the sworn statement that promised to return all government data and not destroy any records involved in the case. Abedin and Mills, however, did not and instead supplied the court with statements from their lawyers.Thursday s court hearing will be the latest turn in an unfolding security scandal involving the former secretary of state that has the potential to undermine her bid to win the Democratic presidential nomination.Via: WFB",BREAKING REPORT: CLINTON AND TWO AIDES BROKE NATIONAL SECURITY LAWS
"Aug 20, 2016","For anyone who s paying attention, Hillary just got caught in ANOTHER big lie Former Secretary of State Colin Powell  has no recollection of the dinner conversation  recounted by Hillary Clinton to FBI agents, as documented by journalist Joe Conason in a forthcoming book.Conason s anecdote, reported Thursday night by The New York Times, recounts a small dinner party at Clinton s Georgetown home toward the beginning of her time as secretary of state, with former secretaries Madeleine Albright, Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice also in attendance. During that dinner, Conason reports, Albright asked the former secretaries to impart advice to Clinton. Powell told her to use her own email, as he had done, except for classified communications, which he had sent and received via a State Department computer,  Conason wrote in his book  Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton,  of which the Times said it acquired an advance copy. Powell, according to Conason s account, told Clinton that  his use of personal email had been transformative for the department  and  thus confirmed a decision [Clinton] had made months earlier   to keep her personal account and use it for most messages. A spokeswoman for Powell s office issued a statement following the Times  story:  General Powell has no recollection of the dinner conversation. He did write former Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department. At the time there was no equivalent system within the Department. He used a secure State computer on his desk to manage classified information,  the statement continued.  The General no longer has the email he sent to former Secretary Clinton. It may exist in State or FBI files. Watch here:Powell s pushback comes amid an ongoing legal dispute between Clinton s lawyers and Judicial Watch over whether the conservative legal watchdog group can depose the former secretary of state as part of its lawsuit over State Department records.Read more: Politico",COLIN POWELL SAYS HILLARY LYING About Private Email Server Conversation: “has no recollection of the dinner conversation” [VIDEO]

"Aug 21, 2016","Mike Rowe of Discovery Channel s show Dirty Jobs  took to Facebook to answer a fan s request to  encourage your huge following to go out and vote this election. Jeremy Schneider writes Hey Mike, I have nothing but respect for you. Your no-nonsense outlook and incredible eloquence have really had a profound impact in my life. Can you please encourage your huge following to go out and vote this election? I would never impose on you by asking you to advocate one politician over another, but I do feel this election could really use your help. I know that there are many people out there who feel like there is nothing they can do. Please try to use your gifts to make them see that they can do something   that their vote counts. Hi Jeremy Thanks for the kind words. I appreciate it. I also share your concern for our country, and agree wholeheartedly that every vote counts. However, I m afraid I can t encourage millions of people whom I ve never met to just run out and cast a ballot, simply because they have the right to vote. That would be like encouraging everyone to buy an AR-15, simply because they have the right to bear arms. I would need to know a few things about them before offering that kind of encouragement. For instance, do they know how to care for a weapon? Can they afford the cost of the weapon? Do they have a history of violence? Are they mentally stable? In short, are they responsible citizens? I would need to know a few things about them before offering that kind of encouragement,  he told the reader.  For instance, do they know how to care for a weapon? Can they afford the cost of the weapon? Do they have a history of violence? Are they mentally stable? In short, are they responsible citizens? And responsibility is what it all comes down to. Casting a ballot is not so different. It s an important right that we all share, and one that impacts our society in dramatic fashion. But it s one thing to respect and acknowledge our collective rights, and quite another thing to affirmatively encourage people I ve never met to exercise them. And yet, my friends in Hollywood do that very thing, and they re at it again,  he observed.He said that liberal celebrities urge their fans to  get out and vote  during every presidential election cycle, calling it our  most important civic duty,  noting that  they speak as if the very act of casting a ballot is more important than the outcome of the election. Calling those pleas  somewhat hysterical,  Rowe said there s an ulterior motive behind them. Does anyone actually believe that Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen DeGeneres, and Ed Norton would encourage the  masses  to vote, if they believed the  masses  would elect Donald Trump?  he asked.He described voting as  a right, not a duty, and not a moral obligation,  which carries with it a responsibility on the part of the voter. But even the irresponsible are allowed to cast a ballot. If you believe aliens from another planet walk among us, you are welcome at the polls. If you believe the world is flat, and the moon landing was completely staged, you are invited to cast a ballot. Astrologists, racists, ghost-hunters, sexists, and people who rely upon a Magic 8 Ball to determine their daily wardrobe are all allowed to participate. In fact, and to your point, they re encouraged. Rowe reasoned that encouraging everyone to vote   regardless of their mental state or knowledge of issues and current events is crazy. When they tell us that  everybody in the country should get out there and vote,  regardless of what they think or believe, I gotta wonder what they re smoking.

"Aug 23, 2016","After Obama was embarrassed by Donald Trump acting more  presidential  than he, as Trump traveled to one of the poorest states in America bringing a semi-truck filled with needs for the LA flood victims. He finally managed to find his way off the golf course on Martha s Vineyard to visit the people who couldn t have cared less if he showed or not, by the time he got there. Like Trump said, it was  too little too late for Obama s phony photo-op.Of course, only Obama could turn the flood into a race issue. While refusing so far to survey the Louisiana flood disaster until days later, he did let state and local officials know that he s watching to make sure they don t engage in racial discrimination. In a 16-page guidance issued Tuesday, the Obama administration, led by the Justice Department, warned Louisiana recipients of federal disaster assistance against engaging in  unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin (including limited English proficiency). The guidance s frameworks  highlight the importance of complying with nondiscrimination requirements of civil rights statutes, addressing the needs of the whole community, and ensuring equal opportunity to access recovery efforts. Black residents should be asking where the thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters, who are so concerned about the lives of Blacks in America are when they really could ve used their help? George Soros, Al Sharpton and Barack are so good at organizing, why weren t they putting their heads together and coming up with a plan to help the poor black residents of LA who had lost everything they owned to the historic flooding? They can be organized in a very short time to create chaos, burn cities and loot, but where are they when they have an opportunity to do something positive for Blacks in LA? The recent flooding that hit Louisiana is the worst natural disaster to hit the United States since Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey in 2012. So far we know that at least 13 are dead and tens of thousands were left homeless in the flooding. Even worse, most of those affected do not have flood insurance. Up to $21 billion worth of housing stock was wiped out by the deluge of rain.The recovery will be long and difficult in one of the poorest states in the country. There is the challenge of finding employment and housing for all these displaced people. Given the fact that Louisiana is a hot and humid state most of the year, there will also be the issues of dealing with mold and increased injuries as people try to rebuild.But one of the greatest stories of the Louisiana flooding is how the people and free markets are playing a role in helping to both rescue people and deliver relief much quicker than the government.Black patriot Arlene Barnum asks,  Where s the BlackLivesMatter men?

The  Cajun Navy  was responsible for saving the lives of thousands of Louisianians and their pets and livestock.#CajunNavy is shown deploying in this pic by Troy @gulfsails #BatonRougeFlood pic.twitter.com/P9yI0QRQoM  walter michot (@WalterMichot) August 15, 2016#CajunNavy doing what they can to help in #BatonRouge pic.twitter.com/7nltb8Q1nU  Ashley Doan (@AshleyMDoan) August 15, 2016The people of Louisiana also distributed immediate relief to their displaced neighbors much more efficiently than the government was able to. One of the best examples of this was the conversion of a movie studio into a shelter housing over 2,000 people. The Celtic Media Centre is one of Louisiana s premier film production studios located in Baton Rouge, which was one of the cities hardest hit by the flooding. The studio s executive director, Patrick Mulhearn, saw how devastated his neighbors were by the high water and decided to open up Celtic as an emergency shelter.There were smaller examples of churches opening themselves up, without prodding by either the Red Cross or the state government, as storm shelters for those who lost everything. Such shelters are all over the parishes that were flooded, and have largely been stocked with supplies by volunteers all over the state. People are even taking donations to the parking lots of stores that were unaffected to bring food, water, and other supplies to the flood zone.People looking to donate supplies have been coordinating their relief efforts on Facebook and other social media. If people are looking to donate supplies, they can use social media to find places to drop them off. If people in other parts of the state and out of state want to donate, they re being directed on social media to places where they can help.Even while the streets of Louisiana flooded, trucks from Wal-Mart and UPS did not stop rolling. Wal-Mart, in particular, was able to use its corporate meteorologists to plan delivery routes and shift deliveries of much-needed supplies such as baby formula and water to the affected areas. UPS is able to prioritize delivery of items such as mail order prescription drugs. Companies are rushing supplies into the disaster area quicker than lethargic government agencies and the Red Cross.Motivated by HistoryIn 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, Louisianians tried waiting on the government. That help never came and over 1,500 Louisianians died in the flood waters of New Orleans, St. Bernard Parish, Plaquemines Parish, and Jefferson Parish. The people of Louisiana learned the hard way that they had to rescue themselves.The people of Louisiana were motivated by a sense of community. While the Federal government was giving anti-discrimination lectures to flood victims, the Cajun Navy was rescuing people of all races. Louisiana has come together like never before.But it wasn t just the compassion of the people of Louisiana that saved lives. Companies which were seeking profit were also responsible. Everyone from the smartphone app developers to the retailers who provided the products to sustain and save lives played a role in this. Businesses and entrepreneurs meeting the needs of customers were literally lifesavers.For entire story: Kevin Boyd","DON’T EXPECT GOVERNMENT Or Black Lives Matter To Help: PRIVATE CITIZENS, FREE MARKET Provide Much Needed Help For Total Strangers In LA Flood"

We can t stop laughing at Steyn s account of Hillary on pretty much everything. The best had to be how Clinton lied about how she was named. Too funny!HERE S OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE BIG WHOPPER HILLARY TOLD ABOUT HER NAME: This story is from 2006 and is the first in a long series of Hillary s lies that we ll be exposing over the next couple of months For more than a decade, one piece of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton s informal biography has been that she was named for Sir Edmund Hillary, the conqueror of Mount Everest. The story was even recounted in Bill Clinton s autobiography.But yesterday, Mrs. Clinton s campaign said she was not named for Sir Edmund after all. It was a sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter, to great results I might add,  said Jennifer Hanley, a spokeswoman for the campaign.In May 1953, Sir Edmund and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, became the first men to reach the summit of Mount Everest. In 1995, shortly after meeting Sir Edmund, Mrs. Clinton said that her mother, Dorothy Rodham, had long told her she was named for the famous mountaineer.  It had two l s, which is how she thought she was supposed to spell Hillary,  Mrs. Clinton said at the time, after meeting Sir Edmund.  So when I was born, she called me Hillary, and she always told me it s because of Sir Edmund Hillary. Even though Bill Clinton repeated the story in his 2004 autobiography,  My Life,  Hillary Clinton did not mention it in her own autobiography,  Living History,  which was published in 2003.But one big hole has been poked in the story over the years, both in cyberspace and elsewhere: Sir Edmund became famous only after climbing Everest in 1953.

The problem is that Romney failed in his strategy of being Mr. Nice Guy and not attacking which really let Obama just steamroll over him in 2012. Not a good idea!Colorful former Trump adviser Roger Stone thinks 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney is thinking about getting back in the presidential race. Stone tweeted his suspicion, and told CNN he had heard that Romney was considering a run from his sources.The move could indicate Romney sees an opportunity to better confront and challenge front-runner Donald Trump. Some see current establishment standard bearer former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as flailing. Trump has mocked Bush for being  just flat  on the campaign trail and Sunday called him a  low energy  candidate.Romney publicly considered a third run as recently as January, but decided against it, after he lost most of his valuable donor base to Bush, and the massive prospective Republican field proved too unpredictable.Romney ran for president in 2012, and lost the nomination to Sen. John McCain in 2008. Romney supporters point to Ronald Reagan s three attempts at the White House   1968, 1976, before his successful win in 1980, as evidence that Romney has a chance.The man who floated this rumor, Trump s former adviser Stone, has a history almost as colorful as that of his former boss. Stone was an aide to President Richard Nixon, and remains one of Nixon s staunchest defenders. He is known for his penchant for expensive but elaborate dress clothes, which are often a departure from the more understated nature of most political menswear.He has been described as a  self-admitted hit man for the GOP  by the Daily Beast, is a popular presence on Twitter, and allegedly, has a tattoo of his former boss   Nixon  on his back.Via: Washington Examiner",IS ROMNEY SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT ENTERING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE?

So there s more incentive for people to come over to this country illegally. So all he s saying is, let s make the process to come here easier and less expensive so there s more incentive to do that. When people cross the border who are not supposed to be here, let s make sure they are sent back.

"Aug 25, 2017","UPDATE: White House official says, ""Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House."" https://t.co/nHPCg5XhOW  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) August 26, 2017According to The Telegraph, now that Mr Bannon is on the outside, he will target a ring of presidential advisers sometimes known as the  globalists . It includes Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, with whom Mr Bannon appeared to have lost a battle over putting more troops in Afghanistan. Now, only one week after Bannon leaves the White House, The Federalist is reporting that Sebastian Gorka has resigned from his post as Deputy Assistant to President Trump, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation.In a blunt resignation letter, the national security and counterterrorism expert expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of the Trump administration.  [G]iven recent events, it is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA promise are   for now   ascendant within the White House,  Gorka wrote.  As a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the People s House. Gorka s letter expressed unhappiness with the direction the Trump administration s foreign policy has taken, as signaled by the president s recent speech on Afghanistan: Regrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will  Make America Great Again,  have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months. This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week The fact that those who drafted and approved the speech removed any mention of Radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of your presidential campaign has been lost Just as worrying, when discussing our future actions in the region, the speech listed operational objectives without ever defining the strategic victory conditions we are fighting for. This omission should seriously disturb any national security professional, and any American who is unsatisfied with the last 16 years of disastrous policy decisions which have led to thousands of Americans killed and trillions of taxpayer dollars spent in ways that have not brought security or victory. During his time in the Trump administration, Gorka focused on issues such as countering the Muslim Brotherhood, the crisis in Qatar, supporting efforts to draft a new long-term national security strategy, and combatting China s economic warfare. Before coming to the White House, Gorka was the Major General Matthew C. Horner Chair at Marine Corps University and also contributed to Breitbart News.Gorka s tenure at the White House was marked by unusually vociferous attacks against him and his family by left-leaning media organizations and the Democratic Party. This includes personal attacks against his wife, mother, and son.A source close to the White House said of his decision,  This was more or less going to be a done deal when Bannon submitted his resignation. Not because he didn t have a protector, but because there is no point in having your life ruined every day if you re not going to get much accomplished.  The same source said that what did change after Bannon left was that anti-Bannon factions began erecting bureaucratic road blocks to undermine Gorka internally.

Most specifically, the massively leading, top of the list responses for Hillary Clinton have to be giving her team nightmares.

"Aug 27, 2016","Apparently, using thug Michael Ferguson s mom as a prop at Black functions was not enough to be granted the Black vote Black Men for Bernie founder Bruce Carter s mission to restore black communities didn t end when Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders lost to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. He opposed Hillary Clinton and the Democratic establishment then because he knew that they didn t represent the minority communities he engaged in politics to fight for.After the leak of internal DNC emails, Carter is convinced that the Democratic Party  rigged  the primary against his candidate and that Hillary Clinton s Democratic Party has no intention of changing the policies that led to the destruction of the communities he s working to improve.Bruce Carter still believes that Hillary Clinton is the poster child for the kind of cronyism, corruption, and evil that the Bernie revolution was built to overthrow. He doesn t believe Hillary Clinton when she labels Donald Trump and his supporters as racists because he knows she falsely labeled her opponents in the primary as sexist  Bernie Bros.  Carter s preparing to take the experience, knowledge, and contacts his group built during the primary to campaign against Hillary Clinton and for Donald Trump and other Republicans in battleground states across the country.Bruce Carter and Black Men for Bernie are at war with the Democratic establishment, whom he says pander for votes but haven t delivered meaningful results to minority communities for decades. Carter became politically active to support Bernie Sanders, who taught him how the establishment s only real constituency was the donor class. When he paired that knowledge with what he knew about the decline in the black and minority neighborhoods he loves, he realized Democratic politicians and the media had been lying. Bernie inspired us to disrupt the status quo because it only works for the elites and not regular people who are struggling,  Carter told Breitbart News.  If black communities vote for Hillary Clinton and Democrats in November, nothing will change because Democrats will continue to believe they don t have to do anything to earn our votes. Carter became one of the most prominent and recognizable supporters of the Sanders campaign by traveling the country in a tour bus and fleet of vehicles wrapped with the Black Men for Bernie logo and a picture of Sanders being arrested during the civil rights movement. His online videos received millions of views and featured celebrities like Mark Ruffalo and ice cream makers Ben and Jerry.This guy knows what he s doing when it comes to rallying the troops to get behind his candidate. Watch Carter organizing supporters for Bernie before Hillary cheated him out of the chance to become the Democrat Party candidate:Carter told Breitbart News that his greatest awakening of how Democrats exploit minority voters came when he learned from the Washington Post that the Democratic Party spends less than 2 percent of its campaign resources with minority-owned companies, even though they get better than 90 percent of the black vote. It is a practice that Carter calls  political slavery. Now Black Men for Bernie are rebranding and again planning to tour the country with an emphasis on battleground states. Carter says he s going to organize black and minority communities to vote against Hillary Clinton and the Democratic establishment. Donald Trump is a business man and a real estate mogul who could provide knowledge and resources to transform urban communities through the development of minority-owned businesses,  Carter said.  With this tour, we re going to show Mr. Trump and Republicans that the black and minority communities are ready to work with anyone willing to work with us to build opportunities in businesses, employment, and housing. We don t want welfare, we need opportunity. Carter had a lot of ideas when asked about what Trump could do to help him win black votes away from the Democrats.  When Donald Trump tells black people, what do you have to lose by voting for me, he s getting close to a message that will work, but it s not quite there yet,  Carter explained: We re going to go back to these communities in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and across the country to lead people to the facts about the Clintons  and Democrats  failures with our struggling communities,  Carter said:For Carter and the Black Men for Bernie, they can t unlearn what they discovered about Hillary during the primary.  We know that Hillary Clinton is for Hillary Clinton and the rich donors of the Clinton Foundation,  Carter said.  We know that Bill and Hillary did major damage to our communities the last time they were in the White House. We know they will lie about their opponents by unfairly labeling them sexists and racists and radicals. Donald Trump isn t a typical politician and he isn t beholden to the same old political powers,  Carter continued.  We want to earn our seat at the table in his administration and I think he and the Republicans are smart enough to realize that when we deliver them a historic number of minority votes, they better do a better job than the Democrats have done or they re never going to get an opportunity like this again.

"Aug 29, 2016","When multi-millionaire San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided to take a stand against an  oppressive  America, some very patriotic Americans hit back.Prior to the 49er s pre-season game against WI Green Bay Packers, multi-millionaire quarterback Colin Kaeprernick, who was raised by White parents made the decision to sit out the national anthem as a form of protest: I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,  Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game.  To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. Kaepernick s decision didn t sit well with many Americans, but this  Gold-Star Mom Teri Maxwell Johnson, who lost her son in Afghanistan isn t just going to sit by idly without letting this whiny,  oppressed  anti-American know how she feels.From Gold Star Mom Teri Maxwell Johnson: My heart is exploding, my lungs are without air, my blood is boiling, my body is shaking, and tears are running down my face. Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers is refusing to stand for the national anthem. His comment stated he would not stand and show pride in a flag that represents an oppressive nation  while there are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder .Mr. Kaepernick, I am sitting in my livingroom looking outside at my American Flag   flying at half staff. You see, my son s body lay in a street after an IED blew up the vehicle he was fighting in. His blood stains the sands of Afghanistan. He died protecting the ideals of the flag you refuse to respect. He died so that ungrateful, privileged, arrogant men like you can be just that   ungrateful, privileged, and arrogant.There are brave men and women all around that stand between evil and you. Men and women willing to die to protect you because they believe in the ideals this country was founded on. Men and women of all races and all religions. Ask them, sir, about pride in the American Flag. Ask them how their heart feels when they hear the National Anthem being sung. You are a public figure, someone young people look to as an example.Shame on you. Shame on you for your disrepect towards those who are true examples of honesty, integrity, pride, and leadership. Shame on you for disrespecting my son and his life. His sacrifice.**Sgt.

"Aug 3, 2015","Is there really any point to go through the work and expense to become an American citizen anymore?Huntington Park may become the first city in California to appoint two undocumented immigrants as commissioners on city advisory boards, a lawmaker confirms.City Councilman Jhonny Pineda has picked Francisco Medina to join the health and education commission and Julian Zatarain for the parks and recreation commission.The 32-year-old lawmaker told CBSLA online producer Deborah Meron that he promised voters while running for office that he would create more opportunities for undocumented residents. Huntington Park is a city of opportunity and a city of hope for all individuals regardless of socioeconomic status, race, creed, or in this case, citizenship,  the councilman said in a statement.  Both these gentlemen have accomplished a great deal for the city. For that, on behalf of the city council, mayor, and our city, I want to say thank you to them both and I am confident they will do an excellent job on their commission posts. Pineda says he cleared the appointments with the city attorney, who confirmed there s nothing that requires a commissioner to be a registered voter, a documented citizen or even a resident, which technically means someone here without legal residency can serve.Appointees first pass a LifeScan background check.Medina and Zatarain would not be paid for the volunteer positions and would not have a direct hand in constructing policy but would help advise the council on legislation. Other commissioners receive a $75 monthly stipend on months when they hold meetings.Coming the same year that California allowed residents to apply for a driver s license, regardless of immigration status, this move is the latest in an effort to recognize an increasingly sizable demographic in the state.Pineda says at 13 years old he emigrated alone to the United States. He established legal residency and told Meron he feels blessed to have been able to come here and work. He s served as a district representative on the California State Senate and legislative assistant for the U.S. House of Representatives. He currently is president of the California Latino Leadership Institute, an organization designed for young professionals interested in leadership development and serving their community.A graduate from Cal State Dominguez Hills with a bachelor s degree in sociology and Chicano studies, Medina interned for then-Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, who now serves on the Los Angeles City Council, Pineda says. Medina also organizes immigration forums aimed a helping working-class communities.Pineda says the decision will be announced at the City Council meeting scheduled for 6 p.m. Monday and will become official after being processed by the council.Via: CBS Los Angeles",TWO ILLEGAL ALIENS TO BECOME FIRST APPOINTED CITY COMMISSIONERS: Hope To Create More Opportunities For Illegals

Sununu:  If the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice, the White House should have been officially notified. Sununu:  What bothers me the most and there must be a reason for it, is Mueller making four of his first hires so blatantly biased lawyers, pro-Democrat lawyers with a bias certainly against the President.

"Aug 31, 2016","In January 2015 a group of Haitians surrounded the New York offices of the Clinton Foundation. They chanted slogans, accusing Bill and Hillary Clinton of having robbed them of  billions of dollars.  Two months later, the Haitians were at it again, accusing the Clintons of duplicity, malfeasance, and theft. And in May 2015, they were back, this time outside New York s Cipriani, where Bill Clinton received an award and collected a $500,000 check for his foundation.  Clinton, where s the money?  the Haitian signs read.  In whose pockets?  Said Dhoud Andre of the Commission Against Dictatorship,  We are telling the world of the crimes that Bill and Hillary Clinton are responsible for in Haiti. Haitians like Andre may sound a bit strident, but he and the protesters had good reason to be disgruntled. They had suffered a heavy blow from Mother Nature, and now it appeared that they were being battered again   this time by the Clintons. Their story goes back to 2010, when a massive 7.0 earthquake devastated the island, killing more than 200,000 people, leveling 100,000 homes, and leaving 1.5 million people destitute.The devastating effect of the earthquake on a very poor nation provoked worldwide concern and inspired an outpouring of aid money intended to rebuild Haiti. Countries around the world, as well as private and philanthropic groups such as the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, provided some $10.5 billion in aid, with $3.9 billion of it coming from the United States.Haitians such as Andre, however, noticed that very little of this aid money actually got to poor people in Haiti. Some projects championed by the Clintons, such as the building of industrial parks and posh hotels, cost a great deal of money and offered scarce benefits to the truly needy. Port-au-Prince was supposed to be rebuilt; it was never rebuilt. Projects aimed at creating jobs proved to be bitter disappointments. Haitian unemployment remained high, largely undented by the funds that were supposed to pour into the country. Famine and illness continued to devastate the island nation.The Haitians were initially sympathetic to the Clintons. One may say they believed in the message of  hope and change.  With his customary overstatement, Bill told the media,  Wouldn t it be great if they become the first wireless nation in the world? They could, I m telling you, they really could. I don t blame the Haitians for falling for it; Bill is one of the world s greatest story-tellers. He has fooled people far more sophisticated than the poor Haitians. Over time, however, the Haitians wised up. Whatever their initial expectations, many saw that much of the aid money seems never to have reached its destination; rather, it disappeared along the way.Where did it go? It did not escape the attention of the Haitians that Bill Clinton was the designated UN representative for aid to Haiti. Following the earthquake, Bill Clinton had with media fanfare established the Haiti Reconstruction Fund. Meanwhile, his wife Hillary was the United States secretary of state. She was in charge of U.S. aid allocated to Haiti. Together the Clintons were the two most powerful people who controlled the flow of funds to Haiti from around the world.Bill and Hillary weren t the only ones profiting off the devastation of poor Haitians. This video shows how Hillary s brother cashed in on a lucrative gold-mining permit in Haiti:An unusual nexus of mining interests, relief work in Haiti, and a former U.S. first family is raising new ethics questions that could affect Hillary Clinton s presidential ambitions.Clinton s brother, Tony Rodham, was a board member of a North Carolina mining company that enjoyed prime access to Haitian gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by former president Bill Clinton through the Clinton Foundation.Another board member of the firm, VCS Mining, was former Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, who co-chaired the charitable Interim Haiti Recovery Commission with Mr. Clinton.https://youtu.be/nlS4SimQfv8The Haitian protesters noticed an interesting pattern involving the Clintons and the designation of how aid funds were used. They observed that a number of companies that received contracts in Haiti happened to be entities that made large donations to the Clinton Foundation. The Haitian contracts appeared less tailored to the needs of Haiti than to the needs of the companies that were performing the services. In sum, Haitian deals appeared to be a quid pro quo for filling the coffers of the Clintons. For example, the Clinton Foundation selected Clayton Homes, a construction company owned by Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway, to build temporary shelters in Haiti. Buffett is an active member of the Clinton Global Initiative who has donated generously to the Clintons as well as the Clinton Foundation. The contract was supposed to be given through the normal United Nations bidding process, with the deal going to the lowest bidder who met the project s standards. UN officials said, however, that the contract was never competitively bid for.Clayton offered to build  hurricane-proof trailers  but what they actually delivered turned out to be a disaster. The trailers were structurally unsafe, with high levels of formaldehyde and insulation coming out of the walls. There were problems with mold and fumes. The stifling heat inside made Haitians sick and many of them abandoned the trailers because they were ill-constructed and unusable.The Clintons also funneled $10 million in federal loans to a firm called InnoVida, headed by Clinton donor Claudio Osorio. Osorio had loaded its board with Clinton cronies, including longtime Clinton ally General Wesley Clark; Hillary s 2008 finance director Jonathan Mantz; and Democratic fundraiser Chris Korge who has helped raise millions for the Clintons. Normally the loan approval process takes months or even years. But in this case, a government official wrote,  Former President Bill Clinton is personally in contact with the company to organize its logistical and support needs. And as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has made available State Department resources to assist with logistical arrangements.  InnoVida had not even provided an independently audited financial report that is normally a requirement for such applications. This requirement, however, was waived. On the basis of the Clinton connection, InnoVida s application was fast-tracked and approved in two weeks. The company, however, defaulted on the loan and never built any houses.An investigation revealed that Osorio had diverted company funds to pay for his Miami Beach mansion, his Maserati, and his Colorado ski chalet. He pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering in 2013, and is currently serving a twelve-year prison term on fraud charges related to the loan. Several Clinton cronies showed up with Bill to a 2011 Housing Expo that cost more than $2 million to stage. Bill Clinton said it would be a model for the construction of thousands of homes in Haiti. In reality, no homes have been built. A few dozen model units were constructed but even they have not been sold. Rather, they are now abandoned and have been taken over by squatters.THE SCHOOLS THEY NEVER BUILT USAID contracts to remove debris in Port-au-Prince went to a Washington-based company named CHF International. The company s CEO David Weiss, a campaign contributor to Hillary in 2008, was deputy U.S. trade representative for North American Affairs during the Clinton administration. The corporate secretary of the board, Lauri Fitz-Pegado, served in a number of posts in the Clinton administration, including assistant secretary of commerce.The Clintons claim to have built schools in Haiti. But the New York Times discovered that when it comes to the Clintons,  built  is a term with a very loose interpretation. For example, the newspaper located a school featured in the Clinton Founation annual report as  built through a Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action.  In reality,  The Clinton Foundation s sole direct contribution to the school was a grant for an Earth Day celebration and tree-building activity.

"Aug 4, 2017","The Washington Post   Nearly a third of territory reclaimed from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria since 2014 has been won in the past six months, due to new policies adopted by the Trump administration, a senior State Department official said Friday.Brett McGurk, the State Department s senior envoy to the anti-Islamic State coalition, said that steps President Trump has taken, including delegating decision-making authority down from the White House to commanders in the field, have  dramatically accelerated  gains against the militants.Combined Islamic State losses in both countries since the group s peak control in early 2015 total about 27,000 square miles of territory   78 percent of militant holdings in Iraq and 58 percent in Syria. About 8,000 square miles have been reclaimed under Trump, McGurk said in a briefing for reporters.Although the Trump administration has yet to announce its new strategy for the campaign against the Islamic State, McGurk cited  key changes  under Trump. In addition to the delegation of decision-making authority, which he said has allowed much greater responsiveness to opportunities and changing circumstances, he cited a  campaign of annihilation  that has concentrated on surrounding cities held by the militants before launching offensives, to ensure that no militants will escape.He said the 2,000 militants remaining in Raqqa  most likely will die in Raqqa.  The United Nations has estimated that 25,000 civilians also remain in the city.McGurk, who held the same job in the Obama administration, also cited renewed administration efforts to  increase burden sharing from the coalition  among what he said were 73 countries. Most of them do not contribute to the warfighting but are expected to help with stabilization efforts in cleared areas, including in the Iraqi city of Mosul, where U.S.-backed Iraq security forces declared victory over the Islamic State last month.","WOW!

"Aug 6, 2016","When you re Donald Trump (or any Republican for that matter) and the Washington Post comes to your defense, you know it means there are too many untruths surrounding the story to pull off this particular lie Donald Trump is complaining that the media has spun a fable that he kicked a baby out of his rally in Ashburn, Va.The New York Post, for instance, headlined its article:  Trump loves crying baby, then kicks the tot out of his rally. The New York Daily News, in its article on the incident, began:  What a baby. Donald Trump booted a fussy baby from a rally Tuesday because the tot was wailing over the businessman s speech. The Guardian newspaper even used the incident to declare that this is a core problem with Trump   that he has  a total lack of empathy. In reality, this is a situation when the video can lie   and Trump s odd sense of humor can backfire. Let s roll the tape.The FactsThere are two parts to the video. During his speech a baby starts to cry, and Trump says:  Don t worry about that baby, I love babies.   I hear that baby crying. I like it. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don t worry, don t worry. The mom s running around like   don t worry about it, you know. It s young and beautiful and healthy, and that s what we want. But then about a minute later he says:  Actually, I was only kidding. You can get the baby out of here.   I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I m speaking. So, just from watching the video, Trump sounds rather cruel. But what s missing is what the mother was doing. As it happens, Daniel Dale, a reporter from the Toronto Star, was sitting right behind her and wrote that the entire incident was mischaracterized.The baby was one row in front of me, three or four rows from the stage, at Trump s event at a high school in Ashburn, Va. When it began to cry, Trump said,  Don t worry about that baby, I love babies. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. I like it. What a baby, what a beautiful baby. Don t worry, don t worry. The mom s running around   don t worry about it. People applauded. One minute later, though, the baby began to cry again. This time, the mother quickly decided to take the baby out of the room. Trump, looking in our direction, appeared to notice that she was on her way to the exit.And then he said,  Actually, I was only kidding. You can get the baby out of here. That s all right. Don t worry. I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I m speaking?  He cupped his hand over his eyes to watch her leave.  That s okay, people don t understand. That s okay. A joke? Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trump s tone is eternally hard to read. But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection   it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mother s own decision to depart.One other salient fact is missing from all the pieces on babygate. Mom and baby, very much not kicked out, came back to their seat a bit later.The baby was sucking a pacifier, silent.Dale had this perspective because he was not sitting in the news media corral.  I almost never request press credentials from the Trump campaign anymore   partly because I like being in the crowd rather than the pen,  he told The Fact Checker.  I was lucky, this time, that the usher people seated me very close to the stage, and one row behind the baby. There was one empty seat up there. Virtually no one in the media noticed Dale s version of events. He said he did not seek to interview the mother himself, as he did not realize until later how much attention had been paid to this incident.  Washington PostWithin days, the Clinton campaign highlighted the baby affair in a video trashing Trump s week:Trump just said he  doesn t throw babies out  of his rallies Let s review the record.https://t.co/u3a8RDNNrr  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 5, 2016Trump responded (as only Trump can) to this ridiculous allegation while speaking at a rally in WI last night:The mother of the baby who Trump allegedly  ejected  from his rally, Devan Cierra Ebert is speaking out and setting the record straight about what REALLY happened.Statement from Devan Cierra Ebert who  was removed  with her crying baby at a Trump Rally: I was the mother in his rally on Tuesday, August 2nd, in Ashburn, VA, with the baby who started to cry. I would just like him to know personally that I, by no means felt I was ever  kicked out  of his rally.I excused myself and my child when he awoke from his nap and began to cry. It was only because I had to grab my child s belongings and then make my way out of the aisle I was seated in that I wasn t out of there sooner.I realize Mr. Trump doesn t know me personally, but for those that do, know that I am the first one to excuse myself and my child when he begins to cry because I personally believe it s rude to disturb anyone else s ability to hear what they came to see. I ve left movies, violin recitals, and other events if I felt my child was disturbing others. It is the considerate thing to do. I stood right outside the doors of the auditorium continuing to watch and listen to what Mr. Trump had to say. In fact, the police that were right outside in the same hallway with me, treated me with so much respect it was incredible. They were so kind and made me feel welcomed to stand with them.One officer commended me on my bravery to bring my child to Mr. Trump s rally.I fully support Mr. Trump. I thought he responded very graciously to my child crying and he made a lighthearted moment out of what I usually consider to be stressful. I actually was out of the auditorium before he even made his follow up comment about my child and even then, when I was informed of his comment,I laughed. I understand he says things jokingly, and I understand no one wants to speak over or struggle to listen over a crying baby.I am in no way offended and I again reiterate, Mr. Trump NEVER kicked me or my child out of the Briar Woods High School, Trump rally.And for the record, while my child and I stood outside of the auditorium, my eleven year old stepdaughter and my Grandmother sat inside the auditorium and continued to support and listen to everything Mr. Trump had to say.We all were so excited to be able to see Mr. Trump so close to home. I didn t have a babysitter to watch my kids and honestly, to me it was a historical moment that I am happy that my kids were there for.I apologize for the trouble this has caused Mr.Trump. The media has severely blown this out of proportion and made it out to be something that it wasn t and is clearly using this as political gain for the Democratic party.I hope this message sheds light to what really happened.Thank you for your time. Best of luck! You have our vote. Trump 2016 Via: Facebook",MOTHER OF CRYING BABY AT TRUMP RALLY: “Mr. Trump NEVER kicked me or my child out”…Liberal Reporter Backs Up Her Story

This painting is taking the iconic symbol of the Statue of Liberty and making it a religious symbol of islam with the hijab. Congressman Correa needs to take this painting down!A student painting that depicts the Statue of Liberty wearing a Muslim hijab, displayed in congressman Lou Correa s Santa Ana office, is being attacked as an unpatriotic violation of the separation of church and state by members of We the People Rising, a Claremont-based activist group that advocates stricter enforcement of immigration laws.The group, which includes several Orange County participants, has asked without success that Correa remove the painting, which hangs with other finalists from the Democratic congressman s annual student art competition.Because of the complaint, Correa said he asked the House Office of Legislative Counsel for advice and was told there was no legal issue. That has not appeased the activists, who are tentatively planning a Sept. 11 protest at Correa s district office. It s a bad example for our congressman,  said Orange resident Mike McGertrick, an activist with We the People Rising.  He shouldn t have anything religious in his office.

"Aug 7, 2015","Hello America Are we awake yet?AUSTIN, Texas   Texas Sheriffs, the Lieutenant Governor, and experts in immigration related issues met at the State Capitol on Wednesday to discuss the federal government s creation of a sanctuary state for criminal aliens through its Priority Enforcement Program (PEP).Jackson County Sheriff Aj (Andy) Louderback, immediate past president of the Sheriff s Association of Texas, told Breitbart Texas that the federal government s PEP program  has created a sanctuary state for criminal aliens because it has gutted the immigration system. A press conference was held on the crisis facing Texas that was created by the new immigration policies of the federal government. The sheriffs complained that aliens are being brought into the criminal justice system in Texas but are being released into the community because of the federal policies.In the past, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) could place a 48-hour hold on illegal immigrants when they were wanted on immigration related issues. The PEP program replaced the U.S. Department of Homeland Security s (DHS) Secure Communities plan and now that is no longer possible.The policy was released by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in November, 2014. In January, the program went into effect and Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby exclusively reported leaked training documents detailing how the program would be implemented. Darby dubbed the program,  Catch and Release 2.0. Breitbart Texas has reported many examples of criminal illegal aliens who have been previously deported many times only to come back and commit even more serious crimes.In July, Breitbart California s Michelle Moons reported on the murder of Katheryn Steinle. She was killed by an illegal alien who was released by the San Francisco sheriff despite an ICE detainer in effect. Her killer had been deported several times.The same week as Steinle s murder, Darby reported on the murder in Laredo, Texas, of a woman who was killed by her criminal illegal alien husband. He had been deported four times. Despite numerous domestic violence calls to the Laredo Police Department, he was allowed to remain in Laredo until he finally killed her.There have been many other such reports in the past month about violent criminal illegal aliens who commit more heinous crimes after returning from being deported.The lieutenant governor, Texas sheriffs, and the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies spoke at the press conference in Austin, Texas. Their message   the federal government has placed the public in danger through its policies, and these policies have essentially tied the hands of Texas law enforcement.Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (speaking) joined Sheriff Aj Louderback; Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne; Victoria County Sheriff Michael O Conner, and Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies for the Center for Immigration Studies. (Photo: Breitbart Texas/Lana Shadwick)Sheriff Louderback told Breitbart Texas,  This federal program (PEP) replaced a Congress-mandated program and replaced it with a program that now prioritizes criminal behavior and is excluding thousands of criminal aliens.  He says the program is forcing Texas sheriffs to sometimes release even violent offenders.Louderback said that criminal aliens know that law enforcement officials in Texas have their hands tied because of these new federal policies. They know they can come into the country illegally and stay here with impunity.He said illegal aliens cannot be held until after there is a final conviction. He said,  These criminals bond out and disappear into the country. These policies, say the immediate past sheriff s association president,  mean that local jurisdictions have to deal with the costs. Victoria County Sheriff Michael O Connor said criminal aliens are traversing over the border and coming in throughout the country. He said that the sheriffs intend to  connect, communicate, and collaborate with community stakeholders  to deal with the problem.Victoria County, Texas, is located about halfway between Houston and the Mexico/Texas border. He said his county is a  fatal tunnel between Harris County and the rest of the U.S. Sheriff Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas,  This is about a secure community program.  He said in 2008, law enforcement were able to do that. He said,  PEP is, and will be, a failure by this [federal] administration. Lt. Gov. Patrick promised that the senate would pass legislation to deal with the problems of sanctuary cities in the next legislative session. He said that he was confident that the senate now has the votes to deal with this issue. Sanctuary cities legislation was a contentious topic in the senate this past session.Via: Breitbart News","SHERIFFS, LT.

Specter s amendment would have stricken the provision regarding habeas review. The underlying bill would have authorized a trial by military commission for violations of the law of war. Here is what Senator Lindsey Graham had to say about the bill from the Senate floor:Senator Graham asked,  Do we really want enemy prisoners to bring every lawsuit known to man against the people fighting the war and protecting us? No enemy prisoner should have access to Federal courts a noncitizen, enemy combatant terrorist to bring a lawsuit against those fighting on our behalf. No judge should have the ability to make a decision that has been historically reserved to the military. That does not make us safer.

"Aug 7, 2017","The Democrats and their allies in the media would like you to believe that President Trump has been so distracted by their allegations and by the untold number of  unnamed sources  they ve quoted in their fabricated stories about him, that he s been virtually paralyzed by the negative press. They d like you to believe he s been so distracted by their antics, that he s been unable to accomplish any of his campaign promises That is 180 degrees from the truth. And that s the case across a wide range of issues, but none is so important   or of long-lasting consequence   as the judiciary.So here s an update on Trump s judicial nominations, as compared to Obama, Bush 2, Clinton, and Reagan. Like Trump, each replaced a President of the other party and each came into office with a Senate of their own party. G.W. Bush made 15 of those 44 nominations on August 2, 2001.1. President Trump has made more judicial nominations at this point than Obama, Clinton, and Reagan combined, all of them outstanding.2. Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has held hearings for more judicial nominees at this point than the Committee held under any of these previous Presidents.3. Despite having to take a cloture vote on every nominee, the Senate has confirmed more judges so far than under these previous Presidents.That s just an incredible record, particularly with regard to the extremely high quality of these picks. And we should be very grateful: it was not at all obvious, even to many of the most ardent Trump supporters, that Donald Trump would be good on judges, given that this is far from his obvious area either of expertise or interest.But in fact, at the rate he s going at present, Donald Trump may well prove to be the best President in American history on judges. And of all the things he might achieve, that is orders of magnitude more important than all the rest.  Rod D.

"Aug 8, 2015","Every GOP Presidential candidate is racing to align themselves with Reagan. Is it possible they just don t really understand why America loved Reagan? Maybe it s just as simple as the fact that he genuinely loved America and was passionate about fixing what had been broken by the previous feckless administration. There are a few candidates in the GOP field who we believe truly love their country and have the same convictions and objectives as Trump. The question is, do any of them have the backbone to do what s needed to fix it? (By the way, we believe there are finally a few candidates in the GOP field besides Trump who do.) (Reuters photo credit)Beneath all the bluster of Trump, there is a very sincere idea that may explain why so many primary voters are flocking to him. And to understand it, we need to look back a few years to his amazing speech at CPAC in 2011:If I remember correctly, the typical conservative pitch one year before Obama s successful reelection campaign was: Obamacare is terrible, the economy is terrible, etc. Conservative principles will fix that. I enthusiastically retweeted a lot of that white noise.With Trump, however, he spent exactly one sentence on ObamaCare, and his economic critique instead fixated on the idea of our wounded national pride:The reason I m thinking about [running for office] is that the United States has become a whipping post for the rest of the world. The world is treating us without respect  America today is missing quality leadership, and foreign countries have quickly realized this. It s for this reason that The United States is becoming the laughingstock of the world  I deal with people from China, I deal with people from Mexico. They cannot believe what they re getting away with. I ve said on numerous occasions that countries like China, like India, South Korea, Mexico, and the OPEC nations view our leaders as weak and ineffective and have repeatedly taken advantage of them to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars a year.He focused his ire mostly on China for manipulating currency and OPEC for gouging prices at every opportunity (he did incorrectly predict $7-9 per gallon gasoline maybe he wasn t in the know on the fracking boom yet). The argument boiled down to two appeals: 1) Foreign countries are making out better than us, and 2) We look weak.In his signoff, Trump delivered a prototype of his current slogan:  if I run and if I win, this country will be respected again  Our country will be great again. That vow didn t come from some overblown promise to get possessed by Ronald Reagan s ghost. Trump simply stated he s had a lot of success in negotiations and business deals because he cares about and relentlessly fights to get the best outcome for his interests. Therefore, he would take that same relentless fight to get the best outcome for America s interests. That might mean screwing over China, Saudi Arabia, or Mexico home to plenty more poor citizens than ours but their leaders care nothing about poverty, and it s a screw-or-be-screwed world.Re-watching that speech, his message and pet issue haven t changed much in four years and I doubt many of us could honestly claim the same feat.As he s officially thrown his hat (and what a hat) into the ring, the Donald has expanded on that message. Not only is his approach the best to fix America s problems, he s saying, but none of his rivals can do it not because they re not competent enough (though, in time, he ll surely call them all dummy losers) but because they re not rich enough.In Thursday night s debate, Trump hammered on a theme of his budding campaign: big-money donations have strings attached take it from a guy who pulled them. I ll tell you what, with Hillary Clinton, I said,  Be at my wedding,  and she came to my wedding,  he said.  You know why? She had no choice because I gave. And, of course, very few big donors pull strings for favors as benign as a wedding RSVP (see: Peter Schweizer s Clinton Cash). The big business types with enough disposable income to donate so much cash to politicians, like Trump himself, have operations around the world and they re not quite as concerned with America s pride as DJT.Indeed, as the Chamber of Commerce crowd has proven with support of a wage-depressing immigration law, they re concerned with growth above all else. And the fastest path to their businesses  growth does not include the step of  More Money for America s Workers.  There s a reason we don t allow foreign nationals to donate to U.S. political campaigns. Trump is sounding the alarm on U.S. citizens whose interests and income can be effectively the same.This issue has been made all the more salient from two major stories coinciding with the start of the Republican primary: Obamatrade and the Iran nuclear deal. Part of a President s job, in a world more connected than ever, is negotiation with other world powers on economic and defense agreements. Over the past 7 years and beyond (most notably, the push for immigration paydirt during Bush 43 s tenure), globalists fueled by left-wing ideology or corporate cronyism have been representing America, while nationalists have been representing our greatest rivals.Obama s failures in defense are seemingly endless Trump s reminder of the Bergdahl prisoner swap seems like an eternity ago, followed by so much more but warnings on donor influence resonate most deeply after the GOP s handling of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for the White House.Indeed, even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) darling of the purest conservatives, inexplicably stood with the Republican establishment on TPA a massive globalist power grab until a last-minute blink, likely thanks to intense grassroots anger at his support. Over a month before Cruz s change of heart, Trump was riffing on a familiar theme:The trade deal is a disaster for many reasons. Number one, we don t have any good negotiators in our government. That s possibly the single greatest reason we don t have our best and our brightest negotiating for us. That s a real problem  What happens is all of these countries get the best of everything and we get the worst of everything.And one day before Cruz announced his opposition, Trump took to Twitter, saying,  Any Senator who votes for it is disqualified for being POTUS.  And he didn t forget his primary objection to the deal:  Protect the American worker and manufacturer! Through all of Trump s controversial life, I see plenty of reasons why reasonable people would balk at his run. I can see why conservatives want detailed policies from him and pledges of allegiance. But I don t see any reason to doubt his love for America.When he s talking about making America great again, I know he s not thinking some WASPy suburban paradise. He s thinking about Manhattan in the 1970s, where he first made a name for himself. He s talking about Weird America where  flash and excess  rule, where you can run for president after getting a WWE bio page.I like that America, where people file $500 million lawsuits over beauty pageants  Spanish-language broadcasts. I d like an America that makes 7  Fast & Furious  movies without making concessions to Ayatollah Khamenei. I d like an America that humiliates the likes of Vladimir Putin, not vice-versa. An America that punches back eight times as hard over a tiny offense. An America that everyone might laugh at but ultimately stop attacking because it can only end poorly for them.And if I trust that Trump likes America almost as much as he likes Donald Trump, then I trust that he will defend America s pride almost as much as does Donald Trump s. The rest of the GOP/Democrat field up to their necks in donors they ll need to mount a national campaign? Not so much.Via: Ezra Dulis  Breitbart News",THE SECRET BEHIND AMERICA’S LOVE AFFAIR WITH TRUMP [Video]

Laura Ingraham interviewed President Trump Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller tonight:Miller has been spot on from the beginning of his tenure as Senior Adviser to Trump He often  warmed up  the Trump rally crowds with incredibly uplifting speeches. He also gave a great speech about why not to vote for Hillary:Trump spokesperson Stephen Miller just hammers Hillary Clinton! You will love every minute of this!The guy is so dialed in on immigration and what needs to be done to reform it.

NUTS!Ingraham pivots to speak about polls and the media Note that he calls the media the  extreme media LOL! Who doesn t love that new term?Ingraham discusses Trump s agenda and the populist movement. It s about trade, immigration, public safety to help ALL Americans.Uplifing everyone is the key!SOME BACKGROUND ON MILLER S RISE TO TRUMP S INNER CIRCLE:When Jeff Sessions first looked at Stephen Miller, he saw potential in the recent Duke University graduate.Miller, then in his early 20s, took up an offer from the conservative author David Horowitz to visit Capitol Hill to introduce him to members of Congress. Horowitz believed that Miller, who penned conservative columns at Duke and in Horowitz  Front Page Mag, would be a capable D.C. staffer. A meeting with Sessions was on the top of Miller s Washington wish list. What was supposed to be a 15-minute meeting became an hour-long meeting with the senator,  Stephen Boyd, Sessions  former communications director who eventually hired Miller.  Sen. Sessions immediately saw that Stephen Miller was an extraordinary young man who had a deep grasp of conservative politics. It wasn t only Sessions who saw something in Miller.When Donald Trump takes the oath of office on Friday, the 31-year-old Miller will be one of the president s closest confidants, serving as a senior White House advisor. That title, announced last month, comes after Miller worked as a senior policy advisor for the better part of a year on the Trump campaign. Trump also tasked Miller with writing his speech to the Republican National Convention, and initial reports indicated that Miller would be writing the inaugural address. The Trump camp is now saying that the president-elect wrote that one himself, although New York Magazine poked some holes in that claim.While Sessions did not have an opening for Miller at the time of that first meeting nearly 10 years ago, he told Boyd to put him on his radar. He came out and he said to me,  I want you to keep an eye on him and see if he can be a part of our team one day,'  Boyd recalled. After working as a press secretary to two House members, Miller was hired as a communications staffer on the Judiciary Committee, where Sessions was the top Republican. I remember setting up a staff and it was Friday afternoon, and I got the go-ahead to hire a press secretary just to work on Judiciary. [Sessions ] directions were very clear and he and I discussed it   that it was obvious this was a kid with a lot of talent,  Boyd said.Miller would move up the ranks from a Judiciary Committee staffer to press secretary for Sessions  office, eventually rising to communications director when Boyd departed to become chief of staff to Rep. Martha Roby, R-Montgomery, in 2012. Miller could not be reached for this story.On the surface, there didn t seem to be much in common between Sessions, who grew up near Selma, and Miller, who was raised in liberal Southern California.The turning point for Miller came after the Sept. 11 attacks, when he was disgusted with how his high school in Santa Monica ridiculed President George W. Bush and how the liberal-leaning faculty banned conservatives like Horowitz and talk show host Larry Elder from speaking at the school but allowed  leftists and a Communist  to address the student body, according to an interview he gave to the Los Angeles Times. During that dreadful time of national tragedy, anti-Americanism had spread all over the school like a rash,  Miller wrote in a 2003 essay,  How I Changed My Left Wing High School,  which Horowitz published.  The co-principal broadcasted his doubts about the morality of the air strikes against the Taliban to the entire school via the PA system. One teacher even dragged the American flag across the floor as we were sending off brave young men to risk their lives for it. It was then that I first took action, writing to prized radio personality Larry Elder. He invited me to discuss these issues on his program, which immediately drew the ire of the teachers, administrators, and even my fellow students. Their resistance only strengthened my resolve. Miller continued his conservative advocacy at Duke, when he gained attention for defending the white lacrosse players accused of raping a black stripper (the players were ultimately exonerated) at a time when public opinion was against them. His position led to appearances on cable news, further raising his profile. Three of our fellow students are being put on trial not because of evidence but because of a DA s incompetence and malice,  he wrote in the university s student paper.  Sadly, many in the community have shown that they are not fair minded but would rather hunt for witches than search for justice. Miller s writings were one of the main factors in Boyd hiring him. I focused on his material he had written for the other two members of the House. I was very impressed he had a column in college and he was a very good writer,  Boyd recalled.  I was impressed with his intellect, I was impressed with his grasp of politics. I was impressed with his ability to get the core of the matter and articulate it in a way [the public would] understand. Sessions  office later found out that Miller had an uncanny ability to channel the senator s when dealing with the press. Colleagues of Miller s and Sessions  told Politico that the two had a  mind meld,  a quality that Boyd also attested to. Miller has demonstrated an ability to capture the voice of his boss in a way that is very important and also exceeds the ability of most Capitol Hill staff,  Boyd said.That voice was mostly flexed on immigration, where explained Sessions  views to the public.When his boss was accused by pro-immigration groups of being a demagogue for his opposition to an unsuccessful 2010 bill to grant illegal immigrants amnesty for enrolling in college or enlisting in the military, Miller stuck to the issue instead of responding with another attack. The DREAM Act is a proposal for mass amnesty that would even include those who have committed serious criminal offenses,  he told AL.com in November 2010.  It would add millions of newly authorized workers at a time when Americans are struggling with high unemployment and recession. Besides being a conduit between the senator and the media, Miller also played a role on policy matters; he was instrumental in helping Sessions derail the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill in 2014 that would have given illegals a pathway to citizenship. Miller helped put together a briefing book for Republicans filled with talking points and data to bolster their case. We had been working on the ideas in it for months, and Stephen put it in the handbook in a very quick time in a very cogent fashion,  Sessions told Politico.  It was very timely and it impacted the outcome of the vote. Boyd said Miller s involvement on policy was unusual for a communications staffer. It is rare, although in his case I think it speaks to his grasp on the issues and his understanding as they impact the average man and woman,  Boyd said.  There s no doubt that there was a great trust between Sen. Sessions toward Stephen Miller and they made a great team. Miller s having switched to a high-level position on Trump s team at a relatively young age does not come as a shock to Boyd, who said his former colleague has adeptly articulated Trump s views. I think personally that Miller was one of the first people to really understand the deep frustration that the American working class is feeling, their concerns with open borders and trade policies that hurt them more than they help, and also brought an ability to channel that energy toward president-elect Trump,  he said.Steve Bannon, former Breitbart News CEO and Trump s campaign manager who will join Miller in the White House as chief advisor to the president, said Sessions  work in the Senate   with Miller s input   paved the way for Trump s candidacy. Whether the issue was trade or immigration or radical Islam, for many years before Donald Trump came on the scene, Sen. Sessions was the leader of the movement and Stephen was his right-hand man,  Bannon told Politico in their June profile of Miller.What started out as the potential of a recent college graduate has turned into high expectations for Miller.

"Aug 9, 2015","The race card thing is getting old fast The Austin County Sheriff s Office released the dash camera video of a July 14 traffic stop of State Representative Garnet Coleman Tuesday to refute claims Coleman made last week about being disrespected and treated  like a child. Coleman, as the chair of the Committee on County Affairs, held a hearing last Thursday in Austin as the first public inquiry into the arrest and death of Sandra Bland in Waller County. In that hearing, Coleman recounted his own history of being pulled over in traffic stops and gave this account of an I-10 traffic stop that happened just two weeks ago. He talked to me like I was a child,  he said of the sheriff s deputy who pulled him over for speeding.  He was so rude and nasty. Even when he found out I was a legislator, he became more rude and nasty. And I didn t understand why this guy was continuing to go on and on and treat me like a child. And basically like I m saying is treat me like a boy. I want to be very clear about that,  Coleman said in the committee hearing.  Via: Breaking 911KHOU    The Texas Municipal Police Association, the Harris County Deputies Organization, the Houston Police Officers  Union and the Dallas Police Union all issued demands for Coleman to apologize for his  fabrication  of the events in the traffic stop. Sheriff Brandes asked Coleman to apologize for his remarks about the sheriff s deputy. Instead, Coleman seemed to double down on the race card  boy  word.

"August 1, 2016","Warren Buffett is one of the richest people in the world (third on the list, according to Forbes  most recent ranking, and he is backing Hillary Clinton for President of the United States. Buffett appeared with Clinton at a campaign event on Monday, and he took aim at Donald Trump.Buffett, campaigning on behalf of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, challenged Trump to meet him  any place, any time  with a copy of his tax returns. Buffett said he would bring his returns and the two of them would answer questions from the public. He dismissed Trump s contention that he couldn t release them because he s being audited. Buffett said his return is being examined by the Internal Revenue Service as well. You re only afraid if you ve got something to be afraid about,  Buffett told a cheering crowd in Omaha.  He s not afraid because of the IRS, he s afraid because of you. While it has been impossible to verify Trump s claims to wealth, investor Buffett   often described as the  oracle of Omaha,  has a well documented fortune that is estimated to be $60.8 billion dollars. Also unlike Trump Buffett is known for living a relatively humble life style for someone with his sort of rent. He lives in a relatively modest home in Nebraska (no gold plating) and traded in his 2006 car for a 2014 Cadillac.Buffett is the third well-known billionaire to come out in support of Clinton and bash Trump. Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Clinton at the Democratic convention, while Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban praised Clinton at a Pennsylvania rally while calling Trump a  jagoff. Trump has claimed to be worth  $10 billion dollars  but has offered no documentation to prove his net worth or show what his tax payments have been. Previous testimony from Trump has shown him wildly changing on his net worth, and he sued an author who documented an investigation showing Trump to be worth several million but not among the world s billionaires.Featured image via YouTube", Meet The REAL Billionaire Who Just Took Trump To The Woodshed (VIDEO)
"August 1, 2017","Washington was rocked by yet another staff shakeup in the White House on Monday when Trump s newly hired communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, was fired after only ten days on the job. But who they are thinking about replacing him with is astounding.Apparently, the Trump administration is somehow considering the possibility of naming Kellyanne Conway, the queen of  alternative facts,  as the new White House communications director.The Daily Caller reports:There is chatter within the White House that Kellyanne Conway is being looked at as the next communications director, a White House insider told The Daily Caller.Scaramucci was ousted after an embarrassingly profane rant in which he called Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who has since been fired, a  f*cking paranoid schizophrenic.  During his temper tantrum, he also made some very unfortunate comments about Steve Bannon s  c*ck.  And as the White House explained, President P*ssy Grabber just can t have someone in his administration using that type of language. (Insert eye roll here.)Now Trump thinks that maybe the person he needs as his communications director is his good old adviser and former campaign manager, Conway. She has proven time and time again that she is loyal to Trump   and that she has no problem lying to the press about anything and everything. This also happens to be the reason that she has absolutely no credibility.Way back in February, Morning Joe s Mika Brzenski said that she refused to have Conway appear on the show because she is the epitome of  fake news. So, Joe was just saying that she books herself on these shows. We know for a fact she tries to book herself on this show. I won t do it because I don t believe in fake news or information that is not true. Everytime I ve ever seen her on television something s askew, off, or incorrect,  Brzenski said on-air.And this is who the White House thinks should be their number one spokesperson? Seriously? The fact that she is even being considered is enough to let you know that these people are a few flakes short of a full bowl of cornflakes. But with Trump in the Oval Office one thing is for sure, just when you think things can t get any more absurd, they do.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images", You Won’t Believe Who The White House Wants To Replace Scaramucci With
"August 10, 2016","Many people will assume those who are religious will automatically vote Republican. That may be true with Evangelicals and Protestants, but that s not the case with Catholics, Jews and Muslims.But there is one religious group that is stuck between a rock and a hard place: Mormons.It s no secret Mormon voters (especially in Utah) hate Donald Trump. He s arrogant, vulgar, an adulterer, a liar and a sneak. And he openly exults it with little to no shame.The New York Times found that Trump does in fact have a  Mormon  problem, with only 33 percent having a favorable view of the Republican candidate. In the Utah Republican primary, Trump finished dead last with only 14 percent of the vote (Ted Cruz won).When it comes to Hillary Clinton, Mormons often give the same response   the cold shoulder   but not with the same vitriol as shown to Trump.That s why Clinton is seizing the opportunity and appealing to weary voters in Utah and aboard, hoping to solidify a coalition of traditional religious, Republican voters.In an op-ed featured in a newspaper owned by the Mormon Church, Clinton makes that appeal head on, writing:I ve been fighting to defend religious freedom for years. As secretary of state, I made it a cornerstone of our foreign policy to protect the rights of religious minorities around the world   from Coptic Christians in Egypt to Buddhists in Tibet. And along with Jon Huntsman, our then-ambassador in Beijing, I stood in solidarity with Chinese Christians facing persecution from their government.We stood up for these oppressed communities because Americans know that democracy ceases to exist when a leader or ruling faction can impose a particular faith on everyone else.Clinton drew parallels between Mormons, who were once profiled and discriminated against, and Trump s call to ban Muslims from entering the United States:Everyday Trump continues to prove he lacks the morals to be our commander in chief. With a new and outrageous headline seeming to pop up every day, it s easy to forget that Trump showed us his true colors early on, when he proposed banning all Muslims from our shores. That would undue centuries of American tradition and values. When it comes to religion, we strive to be accepting of everyone around us. That s because we need each other.The editor of the newspaper shed some hopeful light on the prospect of a Clinton win for Utah, stressing that the Republican, Mormon voter base has a  libertarian streak  when it comes to the issue of immigration, which affects the southwest more than any other region in the United States. Sensing that immigrants make communities stronger, Mormons tend to be more sympathetic to their plights. And the newspaper also noted that Mormon voters are  very sensitive  to religious persecution, which Trump has successfully made a crux in his campaign.The last Democrat to win Utah was Lyndon Johnson in 1964.

"August 10, 2017","It seems like a lifetime since March 23rd, 2010. But thanks to a pretty significant bill signed that day, at least there are no lifetime caps on your health insurance anymore. In fact, there were so many rules and regulations inside Obamacare that benefited consumers instead of insurers that the GOP went absolutely insane trying to undo them. That s no small wonder: Insurance companies gave Republican candidates and conservative groups nearly 37 million dollars in the last election cycle of 2015-16 alone.But the one thing Obamacare didn t do  couldn t do   was clamp down on premiums. Not without changing the way the entire industry is regulated. The fact is, premiums have been skyrocketing for a long time, and for a simple reason. Insurance companies know you need them more than they need you. In other words, because they can. But an interesting thing happened after the ACA was signed: The rising cost of premiums slowed to less than half the growth rate they were undergoing during the Bush years. Why? Because more people were getting insured.Republicans point to raw numbers and call it an increase that happened under Obama. But the premium increase from 2010 to 2016 was much, much smaller than it would have been without the changes to the system that Obamacare wrought. What will they point to now that premiums are on a fast track again? They won t point to Republican policy or Donald Trump. But I will.The Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan, non-profit health care think tank, has been studying premium growth for nearly 20 years. In fact, if you ve ever read stats on health care   who s insured, median cost, what might happen if various bills were passed   you were likely looking at KFF data. And according to their latest study, there s a definitive reason that premiums are going up at the rate they re back to: Because Donald Trump is sabotaging the ACA.Trump s constant description of Obamacare as  failing  is already unhelpful. But his threats to stop cost-sharing subsidy payments are worse. And even worse than that, his persistent badgering of the GOP Congress to repeal Obamacare entirely   even without a replacement plan   has insurance companies scrambling to figure out how to stay in business. If Donald Trump got his way, after all, the number of people without health insurance in America would double in a very short time. And if you don t have insurance, they don t have a customer.So what s the effect of Trump s sabotage? Premiums are about to go through the roof. Just by threatening to stop enforcing the individual mandate   the mechanism that makes Obamacare even work   Trump has caused insurers to request rate increases from regulators anywhere from 1.2 percent to 20 percent. And his threats to stop cost-sharing payments bumps that startling figure up to 23 percent.For years, Republicans liked to point to any increase in premiums as the fault of Obamacare. But premium growth slowed as America got used to the idea of a larger risk pool, and it hasn t started under Obama in the first place. Now we can point directly to the actions of Donald Trump as the reason premiums are once again on the rise.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images"," Trump Is Raising Your Healthcare Premiums, And That’s A Fact"
"August 11, 2016","There s no doubt about it: Trump and his campaign are in full meltdown mode. If he were a nuclear power plant, he d be Chernobyl s number four reactor in the early stages of its spectacularly horrific failure.Panicked Republicans are openly calling for the RNC to pull Trump s funding and send it into down-ticket races. Trump himself, despite being a narcissistic jagoff, is starting to beg for help in places like Ohio and, oddly enough, Utah.And Time has captured everything about this in one beautifully accurate cover:Trump should hate this Time magazine cover, but he ll probably hang it in his office https://t.co/nXe6GuTZ4h pic.twitter.com/u6wAyvBO75  Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) August 12, 2016Time has gone into some depth on what s happened in Trump s camp. They go beyond listing the obvious, like the thinly veiled threat to Hillary Clinton, his bizarrely ridiculous claim that Obama founded ISIS (on which he later doubled down), his childish feud with a Gold Star family, and his equally childish refusal to endorse Paul Ryan, John McCain and Kelly Ayotte in their re-election bids, among other things.He s now anywhere from six to fifteen points behind Hillary nationally in the polls, and trails her badly in several key swing states. His atrocious approach to running for President isn t just costing him deep-red Utah, it s also throwing other traditionally red states, like Georgia, into play.Time points out, correctly, that Trump doesn t understand that the people who attend and cheer at his rallies aren t going to be the people who decide this election. There s a solid chance that he s incapable of understanding that   his ego won t let him. In Jacksonville, he actually said: I don t know why we re not leading by a lot. He could stand to look in the mirror, but he needs a magic mirror to see the truth. He still thinks he s infallible, and that the turnouts at his rallies, along with his Twitter supporters, are accurate indicators of how the country as a whole sees him. So he looks at the polls and finds himself baffled at how he could possibly be losing.After all, he only tells the truth (pardon us while we laugh hysterically).For Hillary, this is awesome news. She needs the next 90 days to be all about Trump and his meltdown, and that s what s happening. Trump may love the spotlight, but he doesn t like the spotlight to be so negative. Time has him on their cover, but in a very negative and unflattering light.In short, they ve highlighted a meltdown he s only now beginning to realize, if not understand.

"August 11, 2017","Before dawn on Wednesday, the feds raided the home of former Donald Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Trump, as intelligence expert Malcolm Nance says, is getting buggy. The investigation is getting closer and closer to him, and his poll numbers are in a free-fall, so from the safety of 17 day golf vacation in New Jersey, Trump is threatening war against not one, not two, but three countries.Most of the media has been covering his exchange of provocative nuclear threats with North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un. If that s not terrifying enough, Trump also hinted that he s planning to attack Iran because, well, they may or may not be abiding by the nuclear deal. All indications are that they are, but that doesn t stop a commander-in-chief who desperately, so desperately, needs a way to wag the dog.On Friday, Trump announced that there might be a third war on the table. This one against Venezuela. We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary,  Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf club on Friday.The president did not answer a question about whether American troops would lead a potential operation. We don t talk about it. But a military operation, a military option, is certainly something we could pursue,  he responded.Source: CNBCTo be fair, Venezuela isn t exactly our friend. Two years ago, President Obama issued sanctions against the oil-rich country, in part over its human rights abuses.The White House said the order targeted people whose actions undermined democratic processes or institutions, had committed acts of violence or abuse of human rights, were involved in prohibiting or penalizing freedom of expression, or were government officials involved in public corruption. Venezuelan officials past and present who violate the human rights of Venezuelan citizens and engage in acts of public corruption will not be welcome here, and we now have the tools to block their assets and their use of U.S. financial systems,  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement. We are deeply concerned by the Venezuelan government s efforts to escalate intimidation of its political opponents,  he added.Source: ReutersTrump, whose only political tactic is to try to intimidate his political opponents, also complained about the human rights abuses, despite having no problems with the human rights abuses of Saudi Arabia, Russia and the Philippines.One fact, and only one fact, might indicate that Trump is just bluster. Trump s cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin might actually be keeping us safer, at least as far as the idea of Trump waging war against Venezuela or North Korea. Venezuela is a strong trading partner of Russia. Putin also backs North Korea, as does our largest trading partner, China.This whole show could be just Trump trying to boost his poll numbers, or it could be his way of pretending to create distance between him and Putin, but regardless, the talk is reckless and potentially deadly. The people he s threatening don t see his talk as political posturing. They are taking it very seriously and even if Trump doesn t pull the trigger first, they certainly could.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images", Trump Is Now Talking About Going To War With Three Countries
"August 12, 2016","Donald Trump still refuses to release his tax returns. So when Fox blowhard Eric Bolling tried to defend him for it he was utterly laid to waste by his own colleague.As usual, the panel of Fox hosts were busy trashing Hillary Clinton and attacking her over her recently released tax returns. But Bolling claimed that he cares more about the transcripts of Hillary Clinton s speeches to Goldman Sachs, remarking that he  really wants  to see them.Julie Roginsky then chimed in suggesting a trade in which Trump would release his tax returns in exchange for the release of the speech transcripts which drew approval from the panel. But Roginsky pointed out that she doesn t think Trump will do it because the New York Times reports that his tax returns will show that Trump pays zero percent in taxes while Clinton paid 43.2 percent in federal, state, and local taxes in 2015.In short, his tax returns would be embarrassing, and would spark outrage as it would be clear that Trump doesn t pay taxes while Hillary Clinton does.Roginsky s colleagues immediately jumped to Trump s defense by claiming that he can t release his taxes because he is being audited, but Roginsky didn t let that excuse fly. She pointed out that Trump is only being audited for a couple years of his taxes and said it doesn t stop him from releasing other years. In fact, an audit doesn t prevent releasing any tax returns at all even if they are under audit.Bolling, of course, continued making excuses for Trump and claimed that he can t release any of his taxes because the current audit could somehow affect his past returns. And that drew a sharp rebuke from Roginsky in which she called him out for being a total hypocrite. You are are coming up with Kool-Aid excuses! If this was Hillary Clinton, you d be the first to demand that she release those taxes. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, if Hillary refused to release her tax returns, Fox would immediately begin demanding that they be released and it would be a never ending topic from now till Election Day. But because Trump is the Republican nominee, Fox News has no problem defending him for refusing to release his own. That is except Julie Roginsky.

"August 13, 2016","A prominent conservative  Christian  is calling for women to be prohibited from having any leadership roles in our society whatsoever.American Family Association radio host Bryan Fischer bellowed about the probability that a woman will be the leader of the United States during his show on Friday.As usual, Fischer claimed that God specifically reserves leadership roles for men only, even in the home and used the Bible as proof. That s always the pattern in the word of God. The kings were all males, when you had a departure from that with Jezebel and Athaliah, it was not a good thing, it did not work out well. Leadership in the church is reserved for men, leadership in the home is reserved for men. In other words, in God s economy, he has designed leadership and authority in society and in the church and in the home to be exercised by men.I think you could make a good case that leadership in culture, society, politically as well as in the home, that that is something in God s economy that s reserved for men. What if somebody had the courage to go on national TV, somebody of some kind of prominence or visibility, and said,  Look, I m going to vote for Trump because he s a man. I don t believe that women should be entrusted with high political office    That s the position I happen to take. Here s the video via Right Wing Watch:Of course, Fischer merely cherry-picked two examples of female leadership in the Bible while blatantly ignoring all the other examples of female leadership.What follows is a list of female leaders in the Bible as put together by religioustolerance.org:Exodus 15:24: Miriam, the daughter of Aaron was a prophet and one of the triad of leaders of Israel during the Exodus from Egypt.Judges 4 & 5: Deborah, a prophet-judge, headed the army of ancient Israel.2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chronicles 34:22 Huldah, a prophet, verified the authenticity of the  Book of the Law of the Lord given through Moses    the Book of Deuteronomy. She triggered a religious renewal.Acts 21:8: Philip the evangelist had four unmarried daughters who were prophets.Romans 16:1: Paul refers to Phoebe as a minister or deacon of the church at Cenchrea.The Gospel of Philip, was widely used among early Christian congregations. It portrayed Mary Magdalene as the companion of Jesus, in a position of very high authority within the early Christian movement.The Gospel of Mary described Mary Magdalene as a leader of Jesus  disciples. She delivering a passionate sermon to the disciples after his resurrection. This raised their spirits and inspired them to start evangelizing the known world.In short, Fischer apparently has never actually read the Bible. It s either that or he only reads the parts he agrees with.And he is not the only conservative  Christian  who wants to place women under the boot heel of men.The Christian right-wing s favorite fake historian David Barton called for stripping women of the right to vote two years ago. And a more recent example would be conservative  Christian  pastor Steven Anderson who called for women to not only be banned from voting but also called for confining them solely to the home.Opinions like these are the reason why women need to band together and put a woman in the White House this November. Conservatives need to be put in their place for their extremist views and that place is definitely not in a position of leadership, but in the fringes where they can never hurt anyone again.Featured Image: Screenshot", WATCH: Conservative ‘Christian’ Leader Says Women Should Be Banned From Being Leaders

One man, Keegan Stephan, tweeted a series of great pictures from New York City, and Fox News promptly contacted him for permission to use them across all their networks.This initially happened via direct message, but Stephan was kind enough to post the brief exchange to Twitter.

"August 14, 2016","Donald Trump s mouth gets him into trouble a lot. There have been endless examples of his inability to curb what he says, which in and of itself means that he is disqualified from the presidency. There are many right-wingers who are so terrified of Trump that they are backing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and while others won t vote for Clinton, they won t vote for Trump, either.Well, now, conservatives have another option: Former CIA operative Evan McMullin. While he has never held public office, McMullin is certainly a sight better than Trump. His candidacy, at this late stage of the 2016 race, is most likely just a way to stop Trump; after all, he entered the race far too late to gain any real traction, and Independent bids for the presidency in America always fail spectacularly. However, thanks to the outrageous nature of Trump s candidacy, McMullin is definitely shaking things up.Appearing on ABC s This Week, McMullin had quite a few choice words for Trump. He said: He s not a credible candidate. It s clear, the numbers, the fact that Donald Trump can t control what he says. He s never had to control what he said. Never in life has he had to do that. It s unrealistic to expect him to do that now. McMullin went on to make the case for voters to consider him instead of one of the two major party candidates: We need someone who will bring this country together. I firmly believe that the time has come in this country for a new generation of leadership, and that certainly is not Donald Trump nor [Democratic nominee] Hillary Clinton. Clearly I disagree with the guy regarding Hillary Clinton. She is easily the most qualified person to ever run for the office of the presidency. But McMullin is definitely right about Trump. There s no way in hell that guy should be anywhere near the nukes. All McMullin s candidacy would do is help further shift things in Clinton s direction, and that is A-OK with me.Watch McMullin s remarks below:.@Evan_McMullin: Trump's ""never had to control what he says It's unrealistic to expect him to do that now."" https://t.co/HFwtipADk6  This Week (@ThisWeekABC) August 14, 2016Featured image via video screen capture", Evan McMullin: ‘Never In His Life’ Has Trump Had To Watch His Mouth (VIDEO)

While many conservatives have stated that Trump s first pathetic response on Saturday was more than enough, many have gone after Trump and called for him to publicly denounce white supremacy in a follow-up statement. Williams said: Mr. President, your initial remarks were cowardly and dangerous, and they indeed warranted a second statement. Williams  attack on Trump got even more bold when she bashed his  Make America Great Again  slogan, stating that people have been confused about the inclusiveness of Trump s message. Williams said that she will no longer give Trump  the benefit of the doubt  when it comes to Trump excluding other races. I was legitimately unsure, but absent more conclusive evidence, I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. I can no longer do that, Mr. President. No more benefit, all doubt. Williams also called Trump out for his statement in which he  very intentionally chose to be ambiguous and to equivocate : President Trump, I do not know your heart. But what I do know for sure is that you ve clearly done the math, and you ve decided that your portion of the base that is absolutely racist is so significant, so valuable that you hesitate, even in the face of blatant, flagrant hatred to risk turning them off and thereby crippling your political stronghold. While you personally might not be a racist, President Trump, what you are is all too happy to reap the benefits of their support. Williams warned Trump that  this moment is on you , making sure that Trump knew he missed a major opportunity to prove his critics wrong. Instead, he only solidified everyone s belief that he s a racist piece of sh*t.

"August 15, 2016","President Barack Obama is sick and tired of talking about Republican nominee, and he didn t hesitate to let everyone know how eager he is for Trump to disappear from the political limelight.While on his 16-day vacation in Martha s Vineyard, Obama took a short break to join Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at a fundraiser   and honored everyone in attendance with an insult the GOP will never forget. Speaking to the 60 donors in attendance, Obama said: I know this is not an audience where I need to make a hard sell. To some degree, I had you at hello when it comes for voting for Hillary. Then Obama laid down some cold truth for the Republican party   Trump is doing such a good job at destroying himself that no one needs to spend time and energy making a case against him: Frankly, I m tired of talking about her opponent. I don t have to make the case against her opponent, because every time he talks, he makes the case against his own candidacy. Ouch. The GOP knows this is true, too   they are currently planning on dumping Trump if he can t stay on message and turn his campaign around. Without a doubt, Obama s words are going to hit too close to home.Obama also spoke about the GOP s  unrelenting negative campaign  against Clinton, and urged Americans to continue to take this election seriously and be fierce in getting their fellow Americans to the polls to vote against Trump, even though numerous sources report that Trump s campaign is tanking. Obama warned that this is no time to relax: If we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake. If we do our job, then Hillary will be elected president of the United States. But if we do not do our jobs, then it s still possible for her to lose. When I say do our jobs, what I mean is we are going to have to continue to be engaged, we are going to continue to have to write checks, we are going to continue to have to make phone calls and rally people behind her candidacy. Obama doubled down and said We have to be aggressive in our campaign for 80 days and that s not a lot, but when you think about the stakes, there s nothing more important.

"August 16, 2016","Jayme Liardi makes no secret of the fact that he s isolationistic and xenophobic, and also seems to support, or at least sympathize with, Nazi ideology. That s not hyperbole   he actually does at least appear to be sympathetic to the Nazis, if not an outright supporter.Now he s created a group for young Trump fans and other young xenophobic conspiracy theorists with a name that bears a striking resemblance to the Hitler Youth. It s called the Trump Youth. While they don t mention Trump s name anywhere other than in their own name, the purpose is clear: Donald Trump represents an end to globalism, an end to multiculturalism, and an end to what Liardi clearly sees as the myth of equality.In a video he s made for the Trump Youth, he speaks of the parasites that we must throw off our backs: These parasites, they want war, they want destruction, they want slavery, and they re getting it. And unless we hold them accountable, unless we take justice into our own hands, and throw these parasites off our backs, the world will come to chaos.  [emphasis mine]He goes on to preach fear about the  New World Order,  which is made up of the globalists that are trying to destroy the world. Watch his entire fear-laced spiel below: The Trump Youth are the  hero generation. What does that whole thing sound like? It s not just that Liardi sees globalists as parasites. Nazis considered the Jews to be parasites that fed on society, and were the root of their problems from the end of WWI, into WWII: In this war for the very existence of the German people, we must daily remind ourselves that Jewry unleashed this war against us  As early as 1922 the F hrer said:  We were also those who for the first time made major efforts to explain to the people a danger that had crept up on us, and which millions of people did not recognize, even though it threatened to ruin us all: the danger of the Jews The German people has recognized that the Jew has crept in like a parasite not only into our people, but into all the peoples of the earth, and that it is attempting to corrupt the original racial characteristics of the peoples in order to destroy them both racially and as states, and thereby rule over them.  [emphasis mine]On his own website, Liardi says of WWII: WWII was a turning point in human history. A battle of opposite ideologies. Nationalism vs Globalism, International Communism vs  Nazism Our world today is the world of the victors, the world of the so-called Allies.On one path you have globalism. This is the world of capitalism/communism  The world of blind  equality : All races, cultures and ethnicities are the same, the sexes are the same, each individual is essentially the same. In our sameness, in our equality we are all one homogenous goop, rootless and without an identity, able to be exploited by the tyrants, our alleged representatives that we have in power today. If you have no identity, one will be installed into you by the kosher forces of The State.  [emphasis mine]So there you have it. A blond-haired, fair-skinned young man trying to create a group to fight for the same nationalism for which the Nazis fought. That he calls the group the Trump Youth indicates he may be a white supremacist himself, since it s evocative of the Hitler Youth and since Trump has received endorsements and support from known white supremacists (but don t call them that. They don t like it).Liardi is definitely a racist, a nationalist, and a conspiracy theorist, and he wants to gather other xenophobic racists to bring Trump s ideology to fruition, possibly even if Trump doesn t get electedFeatured image via screen capture from embedded video"," WATCH: A Nazi Apologist Has Created A Group For Young Trump Fans, And It’s Downright Terrifying"
"August 16, 2017","Christopher Cantwell, one of the Nazis featured in Vice s special about the Charlottesville Nazi riot that left a woman dead, is really really sad yo.Cantwell says he got into the  race stuff  because of Trayvon Martin, who he describes as a  black asshole who acted like a savage  and got himself in trouble. Martin, of course, committed no crime and was walking home from the store when he was stalked and murdered by right-wing activist George Zimmerman.He also describes the actions of his fellow Nazi who murdered a woman with a car as  more than justified  because she was an  animal. I m trying to make myself more capable of violence,  Cantwell explained during the interview   adding that this, not self-defense, is the reason he typically carries a pistol.After the rally, Cantwell learned he might be arrested and really turned into a little sniveling b*tch-boy. I called the Charlottesville Police Department,  Cantwell says through a veil of little Nazi b*tch tears in a YouTube video,  and I said,  I have been told that there s a warrant out for my arrest.

We can t find where Manning posted this picture, but it sounds pretty awesome.He admits that he was  engaged in violence  at the Nazi rally, but blames it on the fact that he couldn t take his gun with him.No, seriously, that s what he says:I ve been engaged in violence, I have. There s no question about it and I ve done nothing to hide that and by the way, if the University of Virginia was not a gun-free zone and I had my pistol I would have stayed far away from that goddamn melee.

"August 17, 2016","So if natural disasters are sent by God to punish us for legalizing same-sex marriage, what does it mean when a flood destroys the home of one of the biggest anti-gay bigots in the country?That s the question that should be asked of Tony Perkins, since he is now living out of an RV because a flood drove him and his family out of their Louisiana home, forcing them to escape in a canoe.During a Family Research Council radio show on Wednesday, Perkins explained that once the water reached ten feet high his family loaded up in the boat and floated toward safety. They attempted to seek a place to stay but were denied by one shelter. So they sought refuge in the home of a former member of their church.Perkins is also still trying to figure out why God would smite his home. We re gonna look for what God s gonna do in this,  Perkins said.  I m asking those questions and I m going to see. Here s the audio via Raw Story.Usually, it s customary to feel sympathy for people who suffer losses due to flooding, but this is a special kind of irony that needs special commentary.As we all know, conservative  Christians  are constantly telling us that whenever there is an earthquake or a hurricane or a flood that it s punishment by God over homosexuality or abortion or some other social issue that has them all in a tizzy, especially when that natural disaster doesn t affect them personally.Now, the idea that God is sending natural disasters to punish people is complete bullshit, but let s just pretend for a moment that that is the case. The Perkins household just got severely damaged by a  flood of biblical proportions  as stated by Perkins himself, and they were driven out of their home.So by conservative logic, that must mean that he is being punished for something. And since Perkins is an anti-gay bigot who wants to suppress women s rights, one could easily surmise that God is sending Perkins a message to stop being a dick toward other human beings. You know, actually love your neighbor and treat others the way you want to be treated.But Perkins will likely fail to see that message. He ll just twist it to his own advantage. Because when it comes right down to it, conservative  Christians  think natural disasters are only sent to punish others, but when they are affected personally they believe it s only sent by God to test their faith. In other words, complete and total hypocrisy.The moral of the story, however, should be that conservatives should stop claiming that disasters are punishments by God, because there is a such thing as karma and Tony Perkins is learning that the hard way.Featured image via Wikimedia"," KARMA: Anti-Gay Bigot Tony Perkins Gets Punished By An Angry God, Flooded Out Of Home"
"August 17, 2017","While the President of the United States seems to be very, very confused about how racism, violence, and bigotry should be dealt with, many Americans are not. In response to the horrific white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, numerous politicians and companies have raised their voices and taken a stand against white supremacy in a way that Donald Trump has not. One of the best responses so far has come from online dating site OkCupid, who responded perfectly when it discovered that neo-Nazi Chris Cantwell was one of its members.Cantwell recently got his 15 minutes of fame when he was seen in a viral video crying about being arrested by police after the Charlottesville attack. Once OkCupid was alerted that Cantwell was a member on the dating website, the company worked quickly to show that white supremacist values would not be tolerated. In response,  white supremacist Chris Cantwell  has been banned from OkCupid   for life! This is the perfect response to a hateful imbecile who stated publicly in the viral video that neo-Nazis like himself were  not nonviolent  and we ll fucking kill these people if we have to.  OkCupid made an entirely appropriate move to not only protect its other members from dating a dangerously unstable psychopath like Cantwell, but to also show that these attitudes should not be tolerated in any degree.To add an extra sting to the end of Cantwell s dating life (especially after he looked so pathetic in that video), OkCupid followed up their banning announcement with this perfect tweet:Bravo. We certainly hope this will encourage more companies to handle intolerant individuals in the same way. When we can t count on our president to do what should be morally obvious, we must count on each other to uphold the true values of this country.Featured image is a screenshot", OkCupid Wins The Internet With PERFECT Response To The Charlottesville Neo-Nazi On Their Site (TWEETS)
"August 18, 2016","Donald Trump gave his first ever apology on Thursday. It was half-assed and the work of a teleprompter, but regardless, he did manage to spit out the words. The Republican nominee told the crowd at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina that he  regrets it  if he at times has said the  wrong thing  and  caused personal pain.  At the same time, he said that this should all be excused and ignored because  too much is at stake. As you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I ve never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I ve never been politically correct   it takes far too much time, and can often make it more difficult to achieve total victory.Sometimes, in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. Trump then attacked the honesty of his rival, Hillary Clinton, and swore that he would  never lie  and would always put the interests of his voters first. In this journey, I will never lie to you,  Trump promised the crowd. I will never tell you something I do not believe myself. I will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours.Trump said that Clinton  has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time,  which is particularly ironic coming from a man who was awarded Lie of the Year by Politifact in 2015. So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day,  he said.So those  wrong things  he has said, the ones he regrets so much, like when he said that all Mexicans are rapists. Yeah, well, that was just him being  too honest.  What a great apology.

But Trump s failure to directly blame the Nazis who stormed the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia in his name while carrying torches and shouting  Blood and soil,  a Nazi Germany era slogan and  Jews will not replace us!  has resulted in a backlash of epic proportions.

If it gets much lower, he ll be in Nixon territory and Mr. Watergate, unlike Trump, started his presidency with strong approval ratings. By the end of his presidency, Nixon s approval rating had tumbled to 24 percent. Now, Nixon may not have had support from Nazis but he did have Roger Stone.Trump s approval ratings are worse than Bill Clinton s were at the height of the proceedings to impeach him because he was the recipient of an adulterous blow job. The Trump campaign s collusion with Russia scandal is rocking the White House but Robert Mueller is all over that.

He had not even given his famous  Two Americas  speech, which took place at the 2004 Democratic Convention on July 27, 2004.

"August 20, 2016","Once again, Republicans are throwing a hissy fit because President Obama did not cut his vacation short to go immediately to Louisiana, but Governor John Bel Edwards put them in their place.As Louisiana deals with historic flooding that has broken records while killing 13 people and destroying tens of thousands of home, Republicans have been complaining about President Obama not dropping everything to visit the state.But during an appearance on The Rachel Maddow Show on Thursday night, Governor Bel Edwards set the record straight.As it turns out, Bel Edwards thinks President Obama s presence would be a distraction that would force the state to shift people and resources to prepare for the visit instead of remaining where they belong.First responders and emergency personnel are still involved in the rescue and recovery phase of the disaster, so pulling them away from that effort would be unwise. Therefore, Bel Edwards appreciates that President Obama did not jump on the first plane to Baton Rouge. The president is welcome anytime he wants to come,  Bel Edwards said. I do want you to know, and your viewers to know, that within hours of me making a request for a federal declaration I got it from the president. He called me. I want you to know that I ve been speaking to Valerie Jarrett just about every day. He dispatched the FEMA administrator to meet with me for an entire day. Today I had the Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. We ve also had the four-star general who runs all of the guard for the country here today. Bel Edwards said he would prefer if President Obama waited a week or two before coming to tour the flood damage and gave an example of what has to done to prepare for such a visit by pointing out how the state prepared for Vice-President Joe Biden s visit when he attended a memorial service three weeks ago for slain police officers. It is a major ordeal, they free up the interstate for him. We have to take hundreds of local first responders, police officers, sheriffs, deputies and state troopers to provide security for that type of visit. I would just as soon have those people engaged in the response rather than trying to secure the president. So I d ask him to wait, if he would, another couple weeks. Bel Edwards also noted that FEMA has been embedded in Baton Rouge since last Thursday, so President Obama and the federal government were well prepared to respond to the flooding unlike President Bush was for Hurricane Katrina, which killed 1,836 people.Rachel Maddow also pointed out that the state would have had emergency funding for this disaster had former Governor Bobby Jindal and Republican lawmakers not crippled state revenue by giving massive tax cuts to the wealthy.Here s the video via MSNBC:In short, President Obama has not ignored Louisiana s struggle. He has done everything short of visiting the state. And if he did visit, it would only do more harm then good.Donald Trump, on the other hand, visited the state and he couldn t even be bothered to cut a check to help those in need. The only  help  he provided was to assist in unloading play-doh from a truck instead of food or water or any other useful supply that people actually need.Meanwhile, President Obama has given Louisiana all the assistance they could possibly ask for in order to help people affected by the flooding. That s what real leadership is all about. Republicans would be well-advised to follow his example.Featured Image: Screenshot", WATCH: Louisiana Governor Tells Republicans To Stop Whining About President Obama
"August 20, 2017","This week s chaotic news cycle was mostly dominated by Donald Trump s disgraceful response to the violence perpetuated by white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and other far-right hate groups in Charlottesville, Virginia. However, that news cycle had a great big exclamation point at the end of it on Friday, when it was announced that Trump s white supremacist Chief Strategist, Stephen K. Bannon would be ousted. Of course, Bannon quickly returned to his perch at Breitbart News, and promised war. Now, we are seeing just what he meant.Everyone remembers the insane interview in which Bannon promised to continue pushing his twisted ideology from outside the White House. He told the Weekly Standard, a conservative publication that has long been critical of Trump, in part: I feel jacked up. Now I m free. I ve got my hands back on my weapons. Someone said,  it s Bannon the Barbarian.  I am definitely going to crush the opposition. There s no doubt. I built a f***ing machine at Breitbart. And now I m about to go back, knowing what I know, and we re about to rev that machine up. And rev it up we will do. Now, aside from the insanity of that remark, it seems that Bannon is just as much of a dangerous lunatic as we all knew him to be. His only loyalties lie with his white supremacist agenda. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that he has already begun attacking Trump s National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster in the pages of Breitbart. This weekend, the right-wing rag ran a story that featured the following headline: H.R. McMaster Endorsed Book That Advocates Quran-Kissing Apology Ceremonies. The attack charges that McMaster refuses to adequately condemn Islam, which is something of a requirement in pro-Trump circles. Where do they get this evidence? Well, because McMaster allegedly supported a military manual that said not to offend Muslims by desecrating their holy book, the Qu ran. Of course, the radical right only thinks that Christians deserve any respect whatsoever.This is likely just a jumping off point for Breitbart s attacks on McMaster now that Bannon is out of the White House. They will likely go after General Kelly as well. After all, it was known that neither of the Generals was fond of Bannon and the combative and chaotic nature of his White House tenure. Despite the messages coming out of the White House, it is widely believed that General Kelly is the one who actually was able to get Trump to get rid of him.All in all, Bannon s return to Breitbart will likely mean heightened chaos in the White House, and therefore in the nation.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Bannon Takes His ‘Weapons’ At Breitbart; Smears ‘Quran Kissing’ McMaster In Scathing Hit Piece
"August 21, 2016","Kirstie Alley hasn t been relevant in the world of acting in many years. Usually, the only way she can get any news attention is by either appearing on the cover of The National Enquirer or by making outrageous statements   which is just what she did on this weekend when she tweeted out complaints regarding President Obama s response to the flooding situation in Louisiana.Everyone is well aware that the people of Louisiana are hurting due to a massive amount of flooding that swept the state. However, due to the fact that the President or any presidential candidates visiting the area would be nothing but a distraction and a drain on resources, the Governor of Louisiana has asked the president and the presidential candidates to not go to the state until things are more controlled. This information somehow missed Kirstie Alley, who, of course, supports Donald Trump for president.

"August 21, 2017","The Congressional Black Caucus, like most Democrats and reasonable people everywhere, have never had very warm feelings toward Donald Trump   to put it mildly. After all, this is a section of the House of Representatives dedicated to protecting the interests and rights of Black Americans, and Trump is a lifelong open and avowed racist. However, they have, for the most part, seemed to stop short of calling for Trump s removal   with the exception of Rep. Maxine Waters, who is, of course, in a league all her own.This level of restraint being exercised by the majority of this powerful group of lawmakers has definitely changed as of late, though. Ever since Trump s disgraceful response to the horrific events in Charlottesville at a rally of neo-Nazis that resulted in countless injuries and the death of a brave young woman, it seems that the Black Caucus is done playing. They want Trump out of office, posthaste. During a conference call held with the press on Monday, Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-LA) said of Trump: You can make an argument based on pure competency and fitness to serve, and that s the conversation the caucus will have. Am I concerned about high crimes and misdemeanors? Absolutely. Am I concerned about this president s fitness to serve? Absolutely. Richmond also indicated that Charlottesville was the last straw when it came to giving Trump the benefit of the doubt when it comes to whether or not he really has the concerns of Black America at heart. Granted, all of this is a pipe dream for now. The GOP will criticize Trump until the cows come home, but they sure as hell won t do anything about him. They won t even formally censure him, much less move to remove him from office.All of that could change, however, if the House is returned to Democratic control in 2018. Folks, if we want to save our republic, we ll give the Congressional power to the Democrats next year while we still have a country to save.Featured image via Law Officer", Congressional Black Caucus Signals That They Absolutely Intend To Impeach Trump
"August 22, 2016","Former President George W. Bush s Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy joined the ranks of an ever-growing list of Republicans who find themselves backing the Democratic nominee when he announced on Monday that he is endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.Speaking with MSNBC on Monday night, James Glassman, who also happens to be the founding director of the George W. Bush Institute at the former president s library in Dallas, officially announced he was backing Clinton and hailed her as by far the superior candidate. She has the experience. She s got the character. She has the values,  Glassman said.  She is the kind of candidate I support and that, as I say, millions of republicans are supporting. Glassman may be the highest ranking Republican to decide that he would have to be batshit crazy to support Donald Trump, but he is far from alone. He joins a growing number of other Bush administration officials who have endorsed Clinton and denounced Trump s bid for the presidency. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, former aide to President Bush Lezlee Westine, and former Bush State Dept. and NSC official Kori Schake have all said that they are backing Clinton over Trump.Sally Bradshaw, who managed two campaigns for Jeb Bush when he was running for governor, has said that because she lives in a swing state, she will cast her vote for Clinton if the race in Florida is close in November. Other former Bush officials, including former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden, have strongly criticized the GOP nominee but have stopped just short of officially announcing their support for Clinton over Trump.Republican Rep. Richard Hanna, who decided a while ago that he would retire when his term is up, is currently the only elected Republican to officially declare that he is endorsing Clinton. However, there are many prominent conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill who have said that they refuse to vote for Trump even though they have not officially come out in support of Clinton.Featured image via YouTube", Founder Of Bush Institute Endorses Hillary Clinton – Even He’s With Her Now
"August 22, 2017","All hell broke loose on Monday when the city of Charlottesville held their first city council meeting since torch-wielding white supremacists took over the small Virginia town, leaving a counter-protester dead in their wake. Residents were more than ready to let the city council know just how they felt about the city allowing Nazis to march through their streets. You had multiple opportunities to intervene and you did not intervene one time.  We told you exactly what you needed to do and you did nothing,  one man told the city council members at the meeting.Two protesters who were holding a sign that read  Blood on your hands  climbed up on top of the dais, at which point several members of the city council got scared and ran away. Police eventually removed several people from the meeting and arrested at least three of them, which prompted the crowd to chant Shame  and  Shut it down. Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy, was the only official who had the guts to stay and try to negotiate with the protesters, who have every right to be pissed off that Nazis were given a permit to spread their hate and violence throughout Charlottesville. The protesters called for Mayor Mike Signer to resign from his position, chanting  Signer must go! After making it abundantly clear that they do not appreciate the city council inviting white supremacists to town, they also demanded the removal of Confederate monuments from Charlottesville. The city agreed to begin the removal process and a motion was approved by the council that will commemorate the victims of the Nazi rally by draping black fabric over the statues.Watch more on the mayhem here, via WVIR: NBC29 WVIR Charlottesville, VA News, Sports and WeatherFeatured image via video screen capture", All Hell Breaks Loose At First Charlottesville City Council Meeting Since Nazi Rally
"August 23, 2016","Donald Trump has been raising a lot of eyebrows lately with his new and pathetic attempts to win over African American voters, despite the fact that he only has about 2 percent of the black vote as of right now. As usual, Trump s delivery has been nothing but problematic, because he s been giving his speeches to mostly-white crowds in mostly-white areas because he doesn t feel safe in urban neighborhoods. This sparked a conversation on CNN that erupted into a heated exchange of words between guests Charles Blow and Bruce LeVell.Don Lemon started the discussion by rolling a ridiculous clip of Trump claiming that he would be able to win 95 percent of the black vote after he serves four years in the White House. LeVell, who was representing the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, got into an argument with Blow so intense that Lemon could hardly contain it and the two men forced CNN to skip a commercial break.Many of the two guests  jabs at each other were delivered in low voices but things got extra heated when Blow, a New York Times columnist, accurately called Trump out for being a bigot and then accused LeVell for supporting bigotry. LeVell responded by trying to place blame on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign by saying that they had purposely portrayed Trump to look like a bigot. This was all too much for Blow to handle. He erupted and laid into LeVell: I m not part of the Clinton campaign. I m a black man in America and I know a bigot when I see a bigot and you are supporting a bigot and that makes you part of the bigotry that s Donald Trump. LeVell fired back,  I know someone who doesn t tell the truth on national TV when I see it, sir. Lemon eventually had to jump in and mediate, and was probably thankful that his guests hadn t been in the same studio for this discussion.

"August 23, 2017","While the right accuses the left of being  snowflakes  because we think all people should be treated with fairness and respect, the right, led by Donald Trump, is becoming more and more frightened of any dissenting voices.That point couldn t have been made more clearly on Wednesday s Fox and Friends. They did one of their  man on the street  segments, where they visited a diner in Louisville, KY. The idea was to have a debate, but only with Fox s rules, apparently. Let s get right to the debate,  (Fox s Todd) Piro said.  Jefferson County, where we are, highly Democrat. Bullitt County, right across the way here, heavy Republican. Turning to a man named Keith, Piro began to ask a question of a  Trump voter    but he was quickly interrupted by a man who approached from behind with a sign reading  Fox Lies. I m a Democrat right here,  the man said.The appearance of an actual Democrat, and not one hand-picked by Fox was a bit too much to deal with, apparently.Source: Raw Story Alright, alright,  Piro replied, pushing the man s sign out of view of the camera.

He did call Fox  fake news  though, which is only a threat, apparently, if a Democrat says it.Then Steve Doocy admitted that  we don t know exactly what was going on there, but they felt it in the best interest of the telecast, we cut away.

"August 24, 2016","Donald Trump s presidential campaign has been trying hard to convince the media and (white) voters that he is wholeheartedly making an appeal to black voters. But in reality the Trump attempt to speak about the issues that black Americans have been insulting and ham-fisted at best.Taking that into consideration, Conan O Brien broadcast an ad poking fun at what Trump outreach to black voters would really look like:Like the real Trump campaign s efforts, the hilarious ad comes across more as something that a white person who has never interacted with a black person would come up with. It starts out echoing Trump in the way he has argued that black people have terrible lives, then ratchets up to point out different ways that Trump could pander to black voters   including appointing Denzel Washington to run the FAA.The comedic bit points out how bad the actual Trump work has been, showcasing just how little attention Trump gives to how real black Americans are dealing with life. Instead, Trump treats these voters as simpletons who are looking to him to be their savior. His pitch has literally been to ask black voters what else they have to lose, a far cry from a positive sales job.And black voters are   understandably   not responding to the Trump come-on. Polls show that Trump is on track to have less black vote support in the election than either John McCain or Mitt Romney did in their elections, although President Obama was on the ballot in those contests.Some polling in swing states has shown Trump polling at zero percent with black voters. They have largely been turned off by a campaign using the most nakedly racist appeals seen in such an effort since the pro-segregation  Dixiecrat  party was a player in the 1960s.Featured image via screen capture", HILARIOUS: What A Trump Ad For Black Voters Would REALLY Look Like (VIDEO)
"August 24, 2017","Early next month, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives will take up a spending bill that provides funding for nearly every department in the federal government. It s a must-pass bill because, without it, the government will shut down. That s a non-starter for many Republicans, who still feel the pain of the last time there was a government shutdown. Republicans were largely unable to shift blame to the Democrats as they attempted to do, and their popularity suffered as a result. But despite the GOP s absolute grip on Congress, the bill is still subject to amendments, and one Democrat from Tennessee has a doozy in mind.Representative Steve Cohen is introducing amendments to the spending plan that would ban the use of federal funds at Trump-branded properties. It covers every business listed on Trump s financial disclosure form, including hotels, country clubs, and resorts. That means events like the ones at Mar-a-Lago where Trump has hosted dignitaries and foreign leaders would either be held elsewhere, or Trump would have to provide accommodations free of charge.Such an arrangement would have prevented the Secret Service from having to stay in a trailer outside Trump Tower, where they moved after price negotiations fell apart over them staying inside while protecting the president. It also would have precluded the State Department from spending upwards of $15,000 on rooms at a hotel that Trump recently opened in Vancouver. Most of all, it might reduce the amount of money you and I pay for the president to spend more than 20% of his time in office (so far) at his own resorts.In a statement Cohen released Wednesday morning, he said:Congress should not allow the President to use his office to profit himself and his family.  The President s refusal to divest from his privately owned businesses creates a conflict of interest when steering federal spending to his resorts and other businesses  The American people should have total confidence that the President is serving their interest, not his own financial enrichment.  President Trump s refusal to disclose information to Congress or seek Congress s authorization for accepting profits from foreign governments stemming from his sprawling foreign financial interests is a brazen violation of the Constitution and a danger to our democracy.We couldn t agree more, Congressman. And while these amendments stand about a snowball s chance in hell of passing   or possibly even being brought up for a vote   it will be nice to see you force Republicans to go on record and either declare their allegiance to Donald Trump, or to the principles of conservatism.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images", House Dem Wants GOP On Record: Stop Gov’t Spending At Trump Properties
"August 25, 2016","Sarah Palin has stepped out of the shadows and sent a warning shot across Donald Trump s bow. Largely silent for most of the election since she endorsed Trump some months ago, Palin is speaking out after Trump made comments that have been interpreted as a change in his anti-immigration position.While there s no actual concrete policy shift, and just comments made on cable news, Trump has said he could back away from his proposed plan for a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.That has angered Palin, who went on the record with the Wall Street Journal.In recent days, Mr. Trump has shifted away from calling for mass deportation of illegal immigrants to suggesting some could stay if they paid back taxes. If Mr. Trump were to go down a path of wishy-washy positions taken on things that the core foundation of his support has so appreciated, and that is respecting our Constitution and respecting law and order in America, then yeah, there would be massive disappointment,  Mrs. Palin, the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008, said in a telephone interview with the Wall Street Journal.  Parts of that message we heard in the last week are clearly not consistent with the stringent position and message that supporters have received all along. Support from Palin undoubtedly helped Trump during the primaries, especially when she had previously been associated with more traditional conservatives like Senator Ted Cruz.But since then she has been on the backburner. He has done few campaign events with her, and she did not receive a speaking slot at the Republican Convention in Cleveland. When asked about the apparent snub, Trump made the bizarre claim,  It s a little bit difficult because of where she is. We love Sarah.

This is a man who was convicted of being a bigot and using the law and the powers of his office to racially profile and brutalize Latino citizens. He was found in criminal and civil contempt of court, but of course, since he was targeting Latinos, who Trump hates, that is just A-Okay with the orange fascist.Generally, when people receive pardons, they have served some time, and shown some remorse. This is nothing more than an extension of Trump s open and visible contempt for non-white immigrants and those from Mexico in particular   and all minorities, really   this comes as no surprise, reprehensible as it is.Also, to top it all off, Sheriff Joe is a birther, and he constantly went to the press to dispute the validity of President Obama s birth certificate in explicitly racist terms. This, of course, was Trump s number one crusade in his original foray into presidential politics, and it was a huge factor in his gaining real traction with the racist Republican base voters.Of course, we cannot forget the infamous  tent city  in which imprisoned immigrants were housed in tents and forced to be humiliated with pink underwear. It goes on and on.This is disgusting. A racist who was found to have used the power of his elected office to enact racism as policy is now going free because the guy squatting in the Oval Office is a racist, too.All I can say is that at least the people of Maricopa County voted him out after all of these years and all of this open bigotry as policy.If there isn t GOP backlash from this, we need to all rise up.

If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,  Bornstein wrote.The letter and Trump s doctor have received renewed scrutiny after the desperate Trump campaign began trafficking in rumor and innuendo about Hillary Clinton s health. Campaign surrogate and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani raised eyebrows when he urged voters to Google search  Clinton illness  to pull up conspiracy theories about the former Secretary of State, and Trump himself has been making remarks about Clinton s  stamina. Despite the Trump campaigns allegations, Clinton s health has been assessed to be good by a real physician citing an actual examination, compared to Trump s doctor.Trump s doctor claims to be board-certified in internal medicine and gastroenterology, but also made comments in his letter attesting to Trump s mental health   how would he have any insight into that?The episode, as with issues of race and religion so far in the election, have shown once again that so many of Trump s attempts to attack Clinton backfire on him due to his odd behavior and the oddity of those he has surrounded himself by.Featured image via YouTube", Trump’s Doctor Makes Bizarre Confession (VIDEO)
"August 26, 2017","Donald Trump just threw a match on this tinder box of a nation when he decided to pardon former Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. This guy is a racist who was convicted in court of contempt for refusing to follow an order to stop racially profiling and detaining people. Arpaio terrorized that county for years with impunity and without consequence, and now it seems that he will be able to carry on being awful.Now, there is even more nefarious news out there regarding this. It seems that Trump tried to get Jeff Sessions  Department of Justice to let Arpaio off the hook by dropping the case against him altogether. It seems that Sessions told Trump that such an action would not be the appropriate thing to do. Having no other choice, Trump waited until Arpaio was convicted, and THEN decided to wait for the perfect time to issue a pardon. One White House official says of Trump s thinking on the Arpaio matter: We knew the president wanted to do this for some time now and had worked to prepare for whenever the moment may come. Of course, we mustn t forget that Arpaio and Trump have been political partners in crime ever since they started the birtherism nonsense, in which they promoted the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States. They both doggedly tried to prove that the nation s first Black President was not a legitimate Commander-in-Chief   all because he s Black.In short, they are two racist peas in a pod, so of course Trump wasn t going to let his man go to jail, even though if there was ever someone who deserves to rot in jail, it s this racist, abusive former Sheriff.One good thing came out of this, though: It showed that when Trump is willing to do something truly egregious, the Department of Justice has maintained at least a little independence and is willing to push back. However, in this instance, said pushback had no real effect.Come on, Congress, Mueller, whomever   please get rid of this lawless president while we still have a nation left.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images", WaPo: Trump Tried To Get Sessions To Let Racist Sheriff Joe Arpaio Off The Hook Months Ago
"August 27, 2016","President Obama used this week s  Weekly Address  to discuss the Zika virus and slam the Republicans who have chosen to block the funding necessary to fight the spread of this mosquito-borne disease.The president began by talking about a call he had gotten from a pregnant woman named Ashley who said she was  extremely concerned  about Zika and  what it might mean for other pregnant women like her.  He added that, as a father, he shared this mother s worry. Conservatives in Congress on the other hand, not so much. Republicans in Congress did not share Ashley s  extreme concern,  nor that of other Americans expecting children. They said no. Instead, we were forced to use resources we need to keep fighting Ebola, cancer, and other diseases. We took that step because we have a responsibility to protect the American people  said Obama.  But that s not a sustainable solution. And Congress has been on a seven-week recess without doing anything to protect Americans from the Zika virus. Obama said that his  Administration has done what we can on our own,  but that is not nearly enough to stop the spread of this disease. He explained the steps that citizens can take to try to protect themselves from the mosquitos who carry and spread the virus: use insect repellent, wear long sleeves and pants, get rid of standing water where mosquitos breed, etc.And then, President Obama tore into the Republican lawmakers who have been dragging their feet when it comes to funding the measures that will stop the threat of this disease, which is known to cause serious birth defects when a pregnant woman is infected, including microcephaly. But every day that Republican leaders in Congress wait to do their job, every day our experts have to wait to get the resources they need   that has real-life consequences. Weaker mosquito-control efforts. Longer wait times to get accurate diagnostic results. Delayed vaccines. It puts more Americans at risk. One Republican Senator has said that  There is no such thing as a Republican position on Zika or Democrat position on Zika because these mosquitoes bite everyone.' I agree. We need more Republicans to act that way because this is more important than politics. It s about young mothers like Ashley. Today, her new baby Savannah is healthy and happy. That s priority number one. And that s why Republicans in Congress should treat Zika like the threat that it is and make this their first order of business when they come back to Washington after Labor Day. That means working in a bipartisan way to fully fund our Zika response. A fraction of the funding won t get the job done. You can t solve a fraction of a disease. Our experts know what they re doing. They just need the resources to do it.

"August 27, 2017","Former Attorney General Eric Holder responded to a report that Donald Trump asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to drop the charges against Joe Arpaio (aka America s most racist sheriff) by throwing shade at the crooked administration on Twitter.The Washington Post published an article on Saturday claiming that Trump had personally asked Sessions to abandon the case against Arpaio, who was convicted of criminal contempt charges after ignoring a federal court order. Holder tweeted out that in all the years he had worked as Attorney General under former President Obama, he had never once been asked to drop charges against anybody, ever. Number of times over six years that President Obama called and asked me to think about dropping a case: ZERO,  Holder tweeted on Sunday, with a link to the article written by the Post included.Number of times over six years that President Obama called and asked me to think about dropping a case: ZERO https://t.co/je7dhk7R28  Eric Holder (@EricHolder) August 27, 2017According to the Post, Trump s advisers told him that asking Sessions to drop the Arpaio case would be a mistake but naturally, he did it anyway. When the charges against Arpaio moved forward, Trump decided that it didn t matter because he was just going to pardon him if he was convicted anyway. What are friends for? Right?Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt charges after a federal court ordered him to stop the racist policing practices he employed as sheriff of Maricopa County, which included jailing suspected illegal immigrants in a  tent city.  Despite the court s ruling that his practices were discriminatory and violated the Constitution, Arpaio basically gave a middle finger to the judge and continued his bigoted tactics.Trump pardoned his loyal supporter on Friday night while the nation was being ravaged by Hurricane Harvey. He was promptly condemned for this move by both Democrats and Republicans alike. Even House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke out against Trump s decision to pardon Arpaio on Saturday.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images", Eric Holder Just Hilariously Called Trump Out On Arpaio: Obama Never Asked Me To Drop A Case
"August 28, 2016","It s been a hell of a week for the Trump campaign with Donald Trump s recent pivots on immigration. The Republican presidential nominee and his surrogates have placed themselves in a place where they can neither go forward nor retreat. The media is trying to get a clear message from the campaign on just exactly where Trump stands on his initial proposal to forcibly deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. Trump campaign senior adviser Boris Epshteyn appeared on CNN Sunday morning, where he gave probably the most honest statement regarding Trump s new position that we re going to get.The idea is lunacy. Not only would such a massive deportation wave create one of the largest human rights crises in history, it would also cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Not to mention the fact that it would also completely destroy the United States  entire economy.That being said, Trump catapulted to his current position by tapping into his base s anti-brown hatred by promising he would do just that. So it could be said that the campaign is trapped between appealing to white supremacists and well, reality itself.After dodging the question on every cable news journalist s lips by talking about Trump s Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton s immigration plan, which agree with it or not on some points, at least actually exists, Epshteyn says: Donald Trump will make sure America stays America and Hillary Clinton s plans will make sure we have illegal immigrants coming to this country at will. Just to be clear,  make sure America stays America  is code for  make sure the United States stays white. That s all the Trump campaign has left. Vague promises to implement racist policies.

"August 28, 2017","It was almost inevitable, really. We were bound to find out just how much better than us the Trumps think they are. After all, Donald himself hails from a long line of Trumps who have never had to work a day in their lives. Why would his own family be any different? And possibly the most spoiled of all is, of course, Ivanka, in whom Donald clearly sees all of the traits he thinks are good about himself.But there s no way to be prepared for the nickname that the president s aides have given her because it is absolutely maddening. According to a long-form piece in the upcoming October edition of Vanity Fair, West Wing advisers have taken to calling her  Princess Royal.  That s a name that came up during the G20 Summit when Trump gave her his seat at the conference table between England and China. The move angered even some insider fans of Trump, with one saying at the time,  This is not a royal family. They ve got that right. America was founded by people who believed in democracy, who wanted to get away from a king. Sure, we love to watch the British royal family   because it all seems like a fantasy. In fact, America s obsession with the Windsors mostly began with Princess Diana, the first in the royal house whose marriage did not include a vow to  obey  her husband.The unnamed advisers to Trump may call his daughter that behind her back, but there is little doubt that both she and her father see things that way. Her appointment to a position inside the White House was essentially a coronation, and the veins of nepotism that course through Trump s administration carry blood as blue as the states Trump lost last November.In the pages of the upcoming article, another anonymous member of the inner circle outlines the problem with Ivanka and even  Prince  Jared:What is off-putting about them is they do not grasp their essential irrelevance. They think they are special.Let s hope the House of Trump is short-lived.Featured image via Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Lord & Taylor", The Nickname White House Aides Have For Ivanka Is Going To Seriously Piss Off America
"August 29, 2016","Another day, another foreign hack into America s electoral system. This time, the hackers aren t targeting the Democratic Party specifically, but rather the state elections systems in an attempt to disrupt the General Election in November.According to the FBI, intelligence officials have sent out warnings, titled  Targeting Activity Against State Board of Election Systems  to state officials, claiming that cyber intrusions at the hands of (allegedly) Russian state-sponsored hackers have penetrated the election systems, with independent reports concluding that among the states affected were Arizona and Illinois. The FBI told  NEED TO KNOW  state officials that they have obtained evidence of  exfiltration,  which is the theft of voter registration data, among other offenses:In the Illinois case, officials were forced to shut down the state s voter registration system for 10 days in late July, after the hackers managed to download personal data on up to 200,000 state voters, Ken Menzel, the general counsel of the Illinois Board of Elections, said in an interview. The Arizona attack was more limited, involving malicious software that was introduced into its voter registration system but no successful exfiltration of data, a state official said.The FBI bulletin posted is requesting that  states contact their Board of Elections and determine if any similar activity to their logs, both inbound and outbound, has been detected. The FBI was able to determine that the hacks were foreign based on eight separate IP addresses that were linked to the sources of the hack, with two of them coming from Russian-backed hackers flagged in the past.Although not coming to any conclusions as of yet, Ken Menzel, the general counsel of the Illinois Board of Election, said the FBI, while certain it was foreign, are still trying to find a possible link between this and the Russian-based group found to have breached the DNC.How interesting that these possible breaches are coming once again from the Russians, after the links between their cozy relationship with the Trump campaign (and Trump asking for hacks) have been exposed. Considering Trump feels the election will be  rigged  against him should Clinton win, it would come as no surprise if these hacks had something to do with making sure Trump has a comfortable win.Trump, are you sure hackings are the way to go this election?", FBI Finds Evidence That Foreign Hackers Infiltrated U.S. Election Systems
"August 29, 2017","A furious Georgia Republican issued a horrifying threat to a Democrat over her push to remove Confederate statues. In an ominous social media post, State Rep. Jason Spencer warned that if former state Rep. LaDawn Jones doesn t abandon her fight against monuments to slavery, she might  go missing. In a contentious back and forth on Facebook, Spencer told Jones that people in South Georgia are people of action, not drama  and then added that people who don t understand that  will go missing in the Okefenokee. Too many necks they are red around here,  he wrote.  Don t say I didn t warn you about  em. Jones, a black woman who represented an Atlanta-based district from 2012 to 2016, did not back down from Spencer s threat of physical violence. Enjoy but know   WINTER IS COMING,  Jones wrote back.  You know it too   otherwise you wouldn t have found a need to even make this post or those hollow threats of not coming to south GA. Spencer now swears that he really wasn t threatening Jones. Of course. No, to the contrary, he was just trying to keep her safe by giving a  warning to her of how people can behave about this issue.  (Insert eye roll here.) She is from Atlanta   and the rest of Georgia sees this issue very differently,  Spencer said.  Just trying to keep her safe if she decided to come down and raise hell about the memorial in the back yards of folks who will see this as an unwelcome aggression from the left. Jones later said in an interview that she and Spencer had developed a friendship during their time representing the people of Georgia and that she wasn t worried about his online threat. If it were anybody other than Jason Spencer, then I would be alarmed. But we had a unique relationship in the Georgia Legislature,  Jones said.  If that had come from anybody else, I d take it as a serious threat. But she did say that she was very concerned  by his appalling reaction to her efforts to remove the statues of people who fought against the U.S. in their quest to continue the practice of owning people based on skin color. Because if that s representative of what people in south Georgia think, then yikes.

"August 3, 2016","No wonder Donald Trump is accusing everything of being rigged   the polls are no longer showing Trump  beating  Hillary Clinton. Some polls have her six points ahead, some seven, some as high as fifteen.But a new poll from the conservative Fox News shows a very telling attitude in the public s shift towards Hillary Clinton. As it turns out, Clinton is leading the conservative-dream-come-true by 10 points, 49 percent to 39 percent, well above the margin of error (3 percent).The poll shows some very good news for Clinton: she s winning over the Obama coalition (which, as we all know, secured his reelection)When it comes to being  qualified  for the office of the presidency, Clinton leads Trump by 22 points (65-43).When it comes to the temperament to be President? Clinton, once again, bests Trump, by 27 points (64-37).When it comes to having the knowledge to be President? Guess who takes the lead! You guessed it! Clinton does, by 32 points (72-40).Trump is only winning men by 5 points, 45-40, and whites by 10 points. Interesting enough, when it comes to whites without a college degree, he leads by only 16. Considering Trump needs a blowout win amongst whites and men to win, these numbers should make Republicans nervous. Trump is currently underperforming all of these demographics when compared to Mitt Romney in 2012.When factoring in Libertarian Gary Johnson, who gets 12 percent support, Clinton still comes out on top with 44 percent to Trump s 35 percent.This poll is drastically different than their matchup in May, where Trump was beating Clinton by 3 percentage points, which sent liberals into a frenzy.Something that also helps Clinton? President Obama s approval rating. Currently, according to the Fox News poll, President Obama stands at 52 percent approval while 45 percent disapprove. That s his best showing on a Fox News poll since May 2011 when Osama bin Laden was killed.As Trump continues his decent into madness, Clinton is looking like the savior we ve all needed during this atypical election season. Liberals, remember, vote! If one thing rings true it s that Trump is unpredictable.

"August 3, 2017","The August 11, 2017 issue of Newsweek is one you might want to pick up. In fact, if you happen to own a golf course or two, you might even want to hang some copies up for decoration, because all that s missing from the cover is the golden club he got as a gift from the PM of Japan leaning against his easy chair.Accompanying the cover is a scathing op-ed from Brendan Smialowski that tears apart the legend Trump has tried to cultivate: He paints a picture of a successful presidency so far, with lots of accomplishments, admiration,  deals  with foreign leaders, and a jet-setting lifestyle befitting the king he surely thinks he is. Smialowski disagrees:The most impressive quality of Trump s myth is not just that it strays from reality but how thoroughly, even aggressively, it contravenes easily confirmable fact. When he was king, he was the King of Debt, and he may still owe as much as $1.8 billion to creditors. His casinos closed. His airline went bust. But even as he accrued failures, lawsuits and debts, Trump managed to turn  Trump  into a synonym for success. The letters were made of plastic, but they were dipped in gold.The article is a must-read, but it s the image on the cover, titled  LAZY BOY, that steals the show:Image via TwitterThe composite image, the caption, the details in this picture   it s almost too good to be true. I don t know if I would have depicted the corpulent commander with a diet soda, but the lazily-wiped Cheeto dust on his $250 Oxford shirt more than makes up for the forgiving choice of beverage.Beside the image is a damning round-up of his presidency by the numbers:  SIX months in office, 40 days at golf clubs, ZERO pieces of major legislation.

"August 30, 2016","The majority of Donald Trump s campaign is built on xenophobia, but while his supporters are ranting non-stop about immigrants, Trump himself is taking full advantage of the flaws in our immigration system   at least according to a report in Mother Jones, in which Trump is accused of human trafficking (my words, not theirs).Are those words a little harsh? Well, according to the report, Trump Model Management has been using foreign models who arrived on tourist visas, not work visas. Yes, that s a violation of federal law. It gets worse, though. The models are what could be considered indentured servants because much of what they make goes right back into the pockets of Donald Trump.Founded in 1999, Trump Model Management  has risen to the top of the fashion market,  boasts the Trump Organization s website, and has a name  that symbolizes success.  According to a financial disclosure filed by his campaign in May, Donald Trump earned nearly $2 million from the company, in which he holds an 85 percent stake. Meanwhile, some former Trump models say they barely made any money working for the agency because of the high fees for rent and other expenses that were charged by the company.Mother Jones interviewed three of Trump s former models, all of whom arrived in this country without proper documentation to be working at all. All of whom compared working for Trump to  modern day slavery.  Two of those models make the claim that the agency urged them to lie.Two of the former Trump models said Trump s agency encouraged them to deceive customs officials about why they were visiting the United States and told them to lie on customs forms about where they intended to live. Anna said she received a specific instruction from a Trump agency representative:  If they ask you any questions, you re just here for meetings. That s not all. The models complained that they were forced to share a two bedroom apartment with at least 10 other models, all at very inflated prices. Most of the models are under age: It is like modern-day slavery  (Canadian born model Rachel) Blais said, adding that  most of the girls in the apartment that were not American didn t have a work visa. We re hoarded into these small spaces,  Kate recalled.  The apartment was like a sweatshop. I was by far the oldest in the house at the ripe old age of 18,  Anna added.Source: New York Daily NewsA few months ago, the Daily Mail reported on a former model who claims that she should have earned $75,000 a year working for Trump s agency, but she took home less than $5,000 in three years. She s suing Trump s agency.It s even rumored that Trump s wife Melania came to the U.S. illegally.Neither Mother Jones nor the Daily Mail used the words  human trafficking,  but according to the United Nations, the definition certainly applies:While there s no evidence in the report of prostitution and definitely no evidence of removal of organs, there was almost certainly deception, fraud and exploitation. Trump would never get away with paying American models so poorly, which is exactly why he imports them.Next time you hear Trump and his supporters chant,  lock her up,  remember this story.

"August 30, 2017","After a brief and almost meaningless visit to Texas, during which Donald Trump didn t meet with a single victim of Hurricane Harvey, the president s cavalcade moved on to Missouri, where he returned to what he really cares about: More money for wealthy people.He s first, of course. His tweets from Wednesday morning prove unequivocally that the only victim he cares about is himself. He sent out a placating message about  horror and devastation  (which he didn t ask even one Harvey refugee about) just 25 minutes after a tweet about North Korea, and only 15 minutes before he went back into Martyr Mode :After reading the false reporting and even ferocious anger in some dying magazines, it makes me wonder, WHY? All I want to do is #MAGA!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2017With that much obsession on his own well-being, why wouldn t the next logical step be another campaign-style stop to try and convince people to support his awful tax plan? Did I say campaign-style? What I mean is, this was not a White House event. This was straight-up partisan. If Donald Trump operated under the rule of law, the RNC would have to reimburse taxpayers for his Missouri speech, in which he explicitly called for the ouster of a Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill. Speaking to a crowd in Springfield, Trump said,We must lower our taxes and your senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you, and if she doesn t, you have to vote her out of office.That s campaigning, not laying out policy. But he doesn t have much policy yet to reveal: The GOP has yet to agree on much of what will go into their  tax reform  package. Trump himself would like to see the  business  tax rate lowered to 15%, a number so low that it would cripple the government without slashing spending on the poor. But even most Republicans oppose so low a rate, and his plans for  tax relief for the middle class and repatriating offshore profits  are, so far, still out in the ether somewhere.The bottom line is, now that he s got that awful trip to Texas out of the way, Trump is on the warpath, and his only focus is now on winning. He even warned the members of his party not to disappoint him on taxes, the way they did on Trumpcare:I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done, and I don t want to be disappointed by Congress. Do you understand me?Oh, we understand, Donnie. You were embarrassed by Mitch McConnell and humiliated by John McCain, so now you want a McVictory to soothe your fiery case of butthurt.

"August 31, 2016","Donald Trump has a new fundraising scheme. He s raffling off lunch with his son Eric and a tour of the Trump campaign headquarters. While this is pretty standard political fundraising fare, it does show how ridiculous and disingenuous Trump s latest attacks against Hillary Clinton actually are.The latest  revelation  about Clinton is that as Secretary of State, she sometimes held meetings with donors to the Clinton Foundation. She also often ignored the requests for meetings, which is completely overlooked by the right-wing press.Trump has taken the report and run with it, calling it  pay to play,  and noting that it s illegal. A couple of very bad ones came out, and it s called pay for play,  he said.  And some of these were really, really bad and illegal. If it s true, it s illegal. You re paying and you re getting things. Source: Politico Paying and getting things,  isn t illegal. That s called capitalism. Paying government officials to get things that only government officials can give   that s called pay to play and yes, that is illegal. There s no evidence that Hillary Clinton did that, unless you count an occasional meeting as  getting things.  Ask absolutely anyone in Hollywood what a meeting means; hell, ask Donald Trump what a meeting means, and you d find that with successful people, a meeting is as much a way of shutting people up as it is an exchange of ideas, let alone favors. Meetings never have and never will imply obligation.Now, let s talk about actual pay to play, the highly illegal type. Donald Trump has actually bragged about bribing politicians and judges. That s unethical at best and illegal at worst. I was a businessman,  Trump smarmed at a debate earlier this year. He was being pressed about the piles of dough he has deposited in Democratic coffers through the years   for his pals the Clintons (including the Clinton Ca-ching Foundation), Schumer, Reid, Pelosi, Cuomo, Rahm, and the rest of the gang. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. You know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them, and they are there for me. . . . And that s a broken system. Source: National ReviewYes, that is a broken system   one Trump is happy to keep broken.Oh, but it gets worse. Trump also allegedly bribes people, as he allegedly bribed people involved in the Trump University case.The trouble started in June, when the Associated Press reported that Bondi  personally solicited a political contribution from Donald Trump  in 2013 right around the time she was deciding whether or not to investigate alleged fraud at Trump University. Trump University, of course, is the controversial for-profit school owned by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.It was only four days after Bondi announced she might join an investigation into Trump University when a Trump family foundation gave $25,000 to a political group supporting Bondi s re-election. After that money came in, Bondi said she would not pursue a lawsuit against Trump University. Two years later one day before Florida s crucial primary election Bondi endorsed Trump for president.Source: Think ProgressThat, if it happens as alleged, is pay to play.

"August 31, 2017","Donald Trump and the Republican Congress may be failing miserably at their attempts to repeal and not replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but that doesn t mean Trump isn t going to chip away at it, eventually dwindling it down to something that can be drowned in a bathtub.Trump took a big swing at Obamacare on Thursday by trying to keep the program secret from people who might be eligible to sign up. The White House is slashing the Affordable Care Act s advertising budget by a whopping 90 percent. They re also cutting the budget for in-person enrollment by 41 percent, so even if people do somehow get the message that they are eligible, good luck signing up. Altogether, that s a 72 percent cut in programs designed to boost enrollment, which is the only way the exchanges will survive.Administration officials cited  diminishing returns  from outreach activities. In a phone call with reporters, they said that most Americans already know about the Affordable Care Act. They plan to make the deepest cuts to the enrollment workers who have signed up few health law enrollees.Source: VoxIf Americans do know about the Affordable Care Act, they have a funny way of showing it. A recent survey found that a third of Americans didn t know that the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare were one and the same. Most concerning, given Thursday s cuts, is that those between the ages of 18 and 29 were among those least likely to know the difference. That s bad. The Affordable Care Act needs younger and healthy participants, or it will smother under its own weight. The surest way to kill the exchanges is to keep them a secret,  says Timothy Jost, a consumer advocate at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  Sick people will find them, but getting younger and healthier people enrolled is the problem. That is exactly Trump s point. He might not be able to kill the act through direct measures, but he can make it go broke. He already told us he would.3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down.

I use the clinical term for fear I might accidentally imagine what Bolling s little  breaking news  might look like.Unfortunately for the minor celebrity, his junk is apparently as famous as he is: According to the HuffPo piece, the recipients of the photos shared them with at least four other people, and conversation about the photos   which can be just as descriptive   reached the ears of more than a dozen. In all, HuffPo spoke to 14 people about the allegations, and everybody s story matched.Maybe Eric s got a freckle or something.A spokesman for Fox deflected, saying  We were just informed of this and plan to investigate the matter. As for Bolling himself, he has been silent. But his lawyer was quick with the standard denial boilerplate:Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made.Bolling s exclusive interview with Donald Trump at the start of his newest show The Specialists may have  rubbed  off on Eric in just the kind of way you d image when two lecherous piles of garbage like that get together.

"August 5, 2017","President Obama s home state of Illinois has passed a bill honoring him by designating his birthday August 4 as a state holiday. So now, every year on August 4, Illinois has a state holiday known as  Barack Obama Day.  While Illinois has a Democratic supermajority in its general assembly, bills must still be signed into law by the governor, and Illinois  governor is a Republican.Once known as  Senate Bill 55,  it reads: [Barack Obama Day] observed throughout the State as a day set apart to honor the 44th President of the United States of America who began his career serving the People of Illinois in both the Illinois State Senate and the United States Senate, and dedicated his life to protecting the rights of Americans and building bridges across communities. They re also renaming a large chunk of I-55, running from just southwest of the city of Chicago to near Bloomington-Normal, in the center of the state. That will become the  Barack Obama Presidential Expressway. That may well rankle Donald Trump and his supporters, who insist that Obama was the worst thing ever to happen to this country. Trump spent a lot of time on Obama s case for his vacations, which is one of the most hypocritical things he does. He also falsely accused Obama of tapping his phones in Trump Tower, and Trump has been steadily working to dismantle everything Obama ever did.Trump has claimed he s the most presidential president this country has ever had with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, and he says he s already gotten more done than FDR. Except, you know, he s gotten zilch done and he s a man-baby on Twitter. He politicized his speech to the Boy Scouts, where he again bragged about himself and actually got the audience to boo Obama.Would New York give Trump a holiday? Probably not, since he lost that state last year and they aren t exactly fond of him there. But who cares about Illinois, right? That state only produced both Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan   two heroes of a Republican Party that s desperate for new heroes.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images", This State Is Honoring Obama And Sending A Middle Finger To Trump At The Same Time – You Can Bet He’ll Be Fuming

"August 6, 2017","Maybe you ve finally heard by now that a mosque in Bloomington, Minnesota was bombed early Saturday morning. Maybe. It seemed confusing as it was being reported, because nobody was calling it what it actually was: an act of terrorism aimed at a church. In fact, you were hard-pressed to find anyone even calling it a hate crime, despite the fact that it clearly was. Everything about the incident added up to exactly what America would have called a terrorist attack   if it had been committed by Muslims, instead of against them.In the New York Times report, details included the fact that congregants has just begun to gather for morning prayers, the fact that the bomb was thrown into the Imam s (pastor s) room, and the fact that one worshiper ran outside at the sound of the explosion just in time to see a truck speeding out of the parking lot. Just everything you might need for a terrorist attack: maximum presence, a specific target, and a fleeing suspect.When news hit the wire that it was carried out with an improvised explosive device   an IED, in the parlance of Middle East wars   you d think that would draw some response from the President of the United States. A terrorist attack on a church, using a weapon you might find in the desert of Iraq. Condemnation from every Republican in Washington, right?Not so much.Apparently there was a terrorist bombing in Minnesota today. Take one guess why Trump has said nothing about it. https://t.co/4PoyfCY4YT  Mark Follman (@markfollman) August 5, 2017Did I miss Trump's statement of concern for the victims of this bombing and members of the Mosque?Does he care? https://t.co/WIWOCewIt4  Marty Parrish (@Marty_Parrish) August 6, 2017Someone bombed a mosque in Minnesota recently. You probably didn't hear about this because mainstream media likes to demonize Muslims.  Brown Saraah (@Brown_Saraah) August 6, 2017It took until Sunday before someone finally called it a terrorist attack, and it was Minnesota s own Democratic governor, Mark Dayton, who used the appropriate language. He visited the Dar al Farooq mosque with a cadre of other public officials, and was devastated by the sight:What a terrible, dastardly, cowardly act was committed. It is a criminal act of terrorism.But Muslims across the country surely know that Trump s silence on the issue is quite purposeful. He s made it very clear that his aim since before he even secured the Republican nomination was to curtail Muslim entry into the US, to marginalize them and monitor them as though their very presence were terrorism in itself. Every attack inside the US that is perpetrated by a Muslim, whether it is related to religion, hate crimes, or simply random, is immediately branded terrorism. But crimes against them are never looked at in the same light.We must support our Muslim brothers and sisters across this country, and never allow them to be marginalized the way Trump and his fellow Republicans want them to be. If we don t hold the terrorist responsible for this attack to the same account we would demand of a Muslim attacker, we are no better than the Trump fans across the country who were no doubt secretly glad that it happened.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images", It Took A Democratic Governor To Finally Call The Mosque Bombing Terrorism
"August 7, 2016","Donald Trump is now alleging that the United States presidential election will be rigged against him. As per usual, Trump s allegations are not supported by any compelling evidence. His supporters have decided that the election will be swayed in Clinton s favor by the big scary liberal media. Trump campaign top advisor, Rudy Guiliani, repeated these claims during an interview on ABC New s This Week Sunday morning.Non-stop conspiracy theories about the media s bias against Trump are a response to Trump s plummeting polling numbers which show that Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is enjoying a comfortable lead.This Week Co-Host, Martha Raddatz, presented a remark that Newt Gingrich had given to the Washington Post: The current race is which of these two is the more unacceptable, because right now, neither of them is acceptable. Trump is helping her to win by proving he is more unacceptable than she is. Raddatz then asks Guiliani,  Is that the way you see it? Guiliani responds, saying that no he does not see it the same way as Gingrich does. He then claims that the media has not hit Clinton as hard as it has hit Trump. According to Guiliani, this is evidenced by the negative media attention that Trump has received during his feud with the Khan family, compared to the media attention that Clinton received because of Benghazi. And I think her comments   Hillary s comments   just don t get the same attention that Trump s do. For example, she lied to a Gold Star mother. She lied to pre   Patricia Smith, the mother of Sean Smith, who   who was killed at Benghazi, I believe, because of her incompetence, her incompetence in failing to secure that mission. And she lied to her on September 14th, 2012, right at the coffin. She said it was due to a video. So I think that s far more serious or at least it said get as much attention as all of the attention that was paid to, you know, the comments that were made about the Khan family. Ah, the press isn t talking enough about Clinton and Benghazi. That s why Trump s campaign is floundering. It couldn t possibly be that Trump is a loudmouth asshat who decided it would be a grand idea to repeatedly insult the family of a deceased war hero, could it?Trump supporters will say anything to try and rationalize away the fact that Trump is a dangerous man who cannot bully his way into the White House.You can watch the segment below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2DClsluYx8Featured image from video screenshot", Rudy Giuliani: Trump Is Losing Because The Media Wont Talk About Benghazi (VIDEO)
"August 7, 2017","During his bizarre  rally  in Youngstown, Ohio, Donald Trump did what he does best: Campaign for a position he already holds. It s become a distressingly common occurrence to see Trump holding giant gatherings that seem to serve no purpose other than to gather crowds of his supporters together in one place. He doesn t generally issue any policy proclamations, but when he does, they are invariably of the sort specifically tooled to please his rabid supporters.No matter what he says, though, it s going to get ironic. Take Youngstown. At the opening of the rally, after his supporters finished chanting  CNN SUCKS!  over and over, Trump had a question for the crowd: Is there any place that s more fun, more exciting, and safer than a Trump rally? I m sure that was reassuring for the protesters in attendance. There are always a few, although I can scarcely fathom how they can stand to be in a room with all that bigotry and hatred. I have no idea how many anti-Trump protesters were in the crowd in Youngstown, but I know this kid was there:Idiotic protester at Trump Rally in Youngstown Ohio gets dealt with ????? pic.twitter.com/IzhBdVCqHh    4  ??

Who knows if his protest even lodged with the president or the crowd   that s not the flag of Russia, with whom Trump colluded to corrupt our democracy, it s a communist flag. A different meaning entirely. Note how the crowd s cheering goes up ten decibels as soon as security applied his giant hands to the teenager s throat. Safe.Three days later, Trump was in front of another crowd, this time police officers. I wonder if he had the incident with this kid in mind when he told the cops in attendance to not  be too nice  in dealing with suspects. It could be he was thinking of the red flag with the hammer and sickle that triggered him in Ohio, or maybe he was thinking about the former police chief there in Suffolk County where he was speaking   the chief that s serving just under 4 years for beating a suspect almost to death.The reckless tone the president takes when he speaks is more than carelessness or a lack of empathy. It s dangerous. All of the world leaders that Trump looks up to   Putin, Duterte, Erdogan   are of the sort that have their detractors silenced, arrested, or even murdered.

"August 8, 2016","On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled his much anticipated and long waited economic  plan  that was, as everyone could guess, wasn t much of a plan.After being advised for a week from an elite billionaire team of advisors (including six guys named Steve), Trump had little to show for his efforts.In what cleverly disguised as a plan to benefit the middle and low class who have been left behind, one didn t have to look too hard to see what it was: a gift bag of benefits for the rich and the most powerful corporations.And there is one person who is the perfect watchdog to pick apart Trump and his absurdities, the person who truly gets under his skin: Elizabeth Warren.Taking to Twitter, Warren knocked some truth into what is being hailed as Trump s  comeback  in the campaign:.@realDonaldTrump s econ plan was written by rich corporate insider advisors to make the economy even greater for rich corporate insiders.

"August 9, 2016","Just when you thought Donald Trump s constant stream of offensive comments had died down, he goes and calls for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to be shot.Trump s specific advice to his followers was, in the event that Clinton wins the election and can choose her own liberal Supreme Court Justices, that they should perhaps shoot her: Hillary wants to abolish   essentially abolish the Second Amendment. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Though the second amendment folks, maybe there is   If a citizen had made a death threat like this against a government official, they would receive criminal charges   and Trump should be no different. Soon after those shocking words left Trump s mouth, the former head of the CIA went on CNN to drive the point home that Trump should not be given a free pass on this.In an interview with Jack Tapper, retired four-star general Michael Hayden made it perfectly clear that if anyone else had said this about the Second Amendment, they d be in hot water. Hayden said: If someone else had said that outside the hall, he d be in the back of a police wagon now with the Secret Service questioning him. Hayden recalled the advice that he used to give his seniors at the CIA: You re not just responsible for what you say. You are responsible for what people hear.  Then, he tore Trump a new one: That was more than a speed bump. That is actually a very arresting comment. It suggests either a very bad taste with reference to political assassination and an attempt at humor or an incredible insensitivity   it maybe the latter   an incredible insensitivity to the prevalence of political assassination inside of American history.

"August 9, 2017","The LA Times is reporting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation carried out a search warrant on the campaign office of Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) in relation to misappropriated funds during the campaign. Specifically, they searched the campaign treasurer s office for documents and electronic records related to campaign spending.This is far from the first time Duncan Hunter has made his way into the news cycle for misusing campaign funds, so it should come as no surprise that the investigation has gone this far. As the LA Times reports:It was the more than $1,300 in video game purchases by Hunter s campaign that first drew the attention of federal election officials and the San Diego Union-Tribune. Hunter blamed his son for the video game purchases, saying he had used the wrong credit card. Other unusual spending by Hunter s campaign included a now-infamous airplane ride for the family rabbit and payments to nail salons, his children s private school and a Phoenix resort. Hunter has already reimbursed his campaign some $62,000 for payments of items such as oral surgery, a family trip to Italy and Disneyland gift shop purchases. And his most recent campaign finance reports show he has spent $336,664 with seven law firms this year, much of that since the House Ethics Committee announced it was stalling its investigation to avoid interfering with the FBI s work.Hunter defended his actions by saying,  I was not involved in any criminal action,  Hunter said.  Maybe I wasn t attentive enough to my campaign. That s not a crime. He s far from the only Republican to blatantly flout campaign finance and anti-corruption laws, though. Trump, for example, is under investigation by several watchdogs for spending heavily at his own businesses, often paying rates above market value or raising prices to make more money from his campaign donors. Former Rep. Michael Grimm was recently convicted and sentenced to eight months.

"Dec 10, 2015","Another Gitmo detainee returns to terror Is anyone else starting to see a pattern here? Former Guantanamo detainee, Ibrahim Qosi, who is also known as Sheikh Khubayb al Sudani, is now an al-Qaeda leader in Yemen.April , 2012  For al-Qosi, his release will allow him to be reunited with his family. Unlike many other prisoners, all of his immediate family are still alive. As Paul Reichler, his Washington-based civilian attorney, who represented him pro bono for seven years, explained,  He is now in his 50s, eager only to spend his life at home with his family in Sudan   his mother and father, his wife and two teenage daughters, and his brothers and their families   and live among them in peace, quiet and freedom. His Pentagon-appointed defense lawyer, Navy Cmdr. Suzanne Lachelier, noted that, last week, al-Qosi was moved to  special quarters,  with  a flat-screen TV, a refrigerator that let him eat at his leisure and a small outdoor gravel-topped patio, all inside a locked enclosure.  Cmdr. Lachelier added there was also  a real bed rather than a steel bunk topped with a mat,  but that al-Qosi slept on the floor before leaving  because he suffers from a bad back. A source with knowledge of al-Qosi s case, who does not wish to be identified, told me that the Obama administration was unwilling to detain al-Qosi after his sentence came to an end, and I believe that one of the reasons that the President negotiated a waiver to the provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act, allowing him to bypass restrictions on releasing prisoners that were imposed by Congress, was to prevent Republicans from trying to force him to continueholding al-Qosi.Summing up his client, al-Qosi s lawyer, Paul Reichler said,  He is an intelligent, pious, humble and sincere individual who has endured much hardship the past 10 years. But he returns home without hatred or rancor. Really? Al-Qaeda leader = peace? The Long War Journal reported:Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) released a new video featuring a former Guantanamo detainee, Ibrahim Qosi, who is also known as Sheikh Khubayb al Sudani.In July 2010, Qosi plead guilty to charges of conspiracy and material support for terrorism before a military commission. His plea was part of a deal in which he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors during his remaining time in US custody. Qosi was transferred to his home country of Sudan two years later, in July 2012.Qosi joined AQAP in 2014 and became one of its leaders. Qosi and other AQAP commanders discussed their time waging jihad at length in the video, entitled  Guardians of Sharia. Islamic scholars ensure the  correctness  of the  jihadist project,  according to Qosi. And the war against America continues through  individual jihad,  which al Qaeda encourages from abroad. Here, Qosi referred to al Qaeda s policy of encouraging attacks by individual adherents and smaller terror cells. Indeed, AQAP s video celebrates jihadists who have acted in accordance with this call, such as the Kouachi brothers, who struck Charlie Hebdo s offices in Paris earlier this year. The Kouachi brothers  operation was sponsored by AQAP. Via: Gateway Pundit ",GITMO PRISONER OBAMA RELEASED IN 2012 Identified As Al-Qaeda Leader In Yemen

"Dec 11, 2016","Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has clearly stated his leaks did not come from Russia. Watch:Former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray, who is a close associate of Julian Assange, said he has met the DNC leaker and he s not Russian. h/t GPI have watched incredulous as the CIA s blatant lie has grown and grown as a media story   blatant because the CIA has made no attempt whatsoever to substantiate it. There is no Russian involvement in the leaks of emails showing Clinton s corruption. Yes this rubbish has been the lead today in the Washington Post in the US and the Guardian here, and was the lead item on the BBC main news. I suspect it is leading the American broadcasts also.A little simple logic demolishes the CIA s claims. The CIA claim they  know the individuals  involved. Yet under Obama the USA has been absolutely ruthless in its persecution of whistleblowers, and its pursuit of foreign hackers through extradition. We are supposed to believe that in the most vital instance imaginable, an attempt by a foreign power to destabilize a US election, even though the CIA knows who the individuals are, nobody is going to be arrested or extradited, or (if in Russia) made subject to yet more banking and other restrictions against Russian individuals? Plainly it stinks. The anonymous source claims of  We know who it was, it was the Russians  are beneath contempt.As Julian Assange has made crystal clear, the leaks did not come from the Russians. As I have explained countless times, they are not hacks, they are insider leaks   there is a major difference between the two. And it should be said again and again, that if Hillary Clinton had not connived with the DNC to fix the primary schedule to disadvantage Bernie, if she had not received advance notice of live debate questions to use against Bernie, if she had not accepted massive donations to the Clinton foundation and family members in return for foreign policy influence, if she had not failed to distance herself from some very weird and troubling people, then none of this would have happened.It is terrible that the prime conduit for this paranoid nonsense is a once great newspaper, the Washington Post, which far from investigating executive power, now is a sounding board for totally evidence free anonymous source briefing of utter bullshit from the executive.In the UK, one single article sums up the total abnegation of all journalistic standards. The truly execrable Jonathan Freedland of the Guardian writes  Few credible sources doubt that Russia was behind the hacking of internal Democratic party emails, whose release by Julian Assange was timed to cause maximum pain to Hillary Clinton and pleasure for Trump.  Does he produce any evidence at all for this assertion? No, none whatsoever. What does a journalist mean by a  credible source ? Well, any journalist worth their salt in considering the credibility of a source will first consider access. Do they credibly have access to the information they claim to have?Now both Julian Assange and I have stated definitively the leak does not come from Russia. Do we credibly have access? Yes, very obviously. Very, very few people can be said to definitely have access to the source of the leak. The people saying it is not Russia are those who do have access. After access, you consider truthfulness. Do Julian Assange and I have a reputation for truthfulness? Well in 10 years not one of the tens of thousands of documents WikiLeaks has released has had its authenticity successfully challenged. As for me, I have a reputation for inconvenient truth telling.Contrast this to the  credible sources  Freedland relies on. What access do they have to the whistleblower? Zero. They have not the faintest idea who the whistleblower is. Otherwise they would have arrested them. What reputation do they have for truthfulness? It s the Clinton gang and the US government, for goodness sake.The worst thing about all this is that it is aimed at promoting further conflict with Russia. This puts everyone in danger for the sake of more profits for the arms and security industries   including of course bigger budgets for the CIA.

"Dec 11, 2017","The exclusive below from Fox news skips the fact that the Trump dossier had been circulated around but was NEVER proven to be true AT ALL! Why did John McCain feel it necessary to bring this  fake  dossier to the attention of anyone in the U.S. intel community? The Deep State desperately wants to destroy President Trump and this happens to be Exhibit Numero Uno:The man who says he acted as a  go-between  last year to inform Sen. John McCain about the controversial  dossier  containing salacious allegations about then-candidate Donald Trump is speaking out, revealing how the ex-British spy who researched the document helped coordinate its release to the FBI, the media and Capitol Hill. My mission was essentially to be a go-between and a messenger, to tell the senator and assistants that such a dossier existed,  Sir Andrew Wood told Fox News in an exclusive interview with senior executive producer Pamela K. Browne.Fox News spoke to Wood at the 2017 Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada. As Britain s ambassador to Moscow from 1995-2000, Wood witnessed the end of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the rise of Vladimir Putin.Just after the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, Arizona GOP Sen. McCain spoke at the same security conference. Wood says he was instructed  by former British spy Christopher Steele  to reach out to the senior Republican, whom Wood called  a good man,  about the unverified document.HERE S WHAT MCCAIN HAD TO SAY A FEW MONTHS AGO PUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE KNOW NOW:THE RUSSIAN LAWYER MET WITH SIMPSON OF FUSION GPS BEFORE THE MEETING WITH TRUMP JR IT WAS A SET-UP!Watch RINO Senator John McCain express his concern overt the seriousness of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with the Russian lawyer about the lifting US sanctions on Russian adoption. It s curious that the reporter never asked McCain about his efforts to smear our president with a unsubstantiated dirty dossier from an ex-spy:In August 2016,  Steele came to me to tell me what was in it, and why it   was important,  Wood said.  He made it very clear   yes, it was raw intelligence, but it needed putting into proper context before you could judge it fully. August 2016 is a critical period, just after the FBI opened the Russia meddling probe, and after then-director James Comey recommended against prosecution for Clinton s mishandling of classified information.Wood said Steele had  already been in contact with the FBI  at the time. He said there was corroborating evidence in the United States, from which I assumed he was working with an American company,  Wood said.British court records reviewed by Fox News as well as U.S. congressional testimony revealed that Steele was directed and paid at least $168,000 by Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson to push the research that fall to five American media outlets. According to British court documents, Steele met with The New York Times (twice), The Washington Post (twice), CNN, The New Yorker and Yahoo News (twice). Each of these interviews was conducted in person and with a member of Fusion also present,  according to the records associated with separate civil litigation against Steele and Fusion GPS.Wood said he d heard of Fusion GPS, as the group Steele was working with, but had  never heard of Mr. Simpson. Three weeks after Trump won the presidential election, at the Canadian security conference, the details were finalized for the dossier hand-off to McCain.Read more: Fox News",SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN’S Trump Dossier Hand Off…The “Go-Between” Speaks Out

Meanwhile, the Republicans did exactly what they always do they splintered, they argued amongst themselves, and they waited until the 11th hour to get behind Roy Moore, the Republican candidate who was accused (without evidence) by several women (one of whom admitted to committing forgery in a high school yearbook used as evidence of her claim against him) of sexual misconduct several decades ago. The media will try to blame this loss on President Trump, but the truth of the matter is, that the Republican Party came late to the game with funding and with support for Roy Moore, while half of the party either sat on their hands or openly condemned their candidate.

"Dec 15, 2016","The Democrats have 26 more days to discredit Donald J. Trump until he becomes our next President. They are really pulling out all of the stops. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange emerges from hiding to do an interview with Fox News  Sean Hannity in order to set the record straight on the DNC leaks he released prior to the election. It s interesting how mainstream media  reporters  have no interest in the content of those undisputed leaked emails, they only care about how they got into the hands of Julian Assange.Julian Assange has finally spoken out on the recent news about intel assessments on Russia being the source of hacking designed to reportedly help Donald Trump. Julian Assange spoke with Sean Hannity on his radio show this afternoon and stated,  Our source is not the Russian government.  He told Hannity WikiLeaks did receive a little bit of information having to do with Trump and the RNC, but  it was already public somewhere else. https://youtu.be/GJIVOsptcBsHannity applauded Assange and said he s  done us a favor  by 1) showing how weak U.S. cybersecurity is, and 2) exposing government corruption. He asked Assange if the information he received came from inside the United States. Assange did not say definitively, but insisted,  It has not come from a state party.  (At a later point in the interview, Assange said that info leaks from other places could have been from Russia.) Hannity also asked him if President Obama knows this too and is  purposefully  pushing a false narrative to delegitimize Trump. Assange said yes. On Thursday afternoon, Hannity, the Fox News host and informal Trump adviser, once again interviewed WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange this time on Hannity s nationally syndicated radio show. Hannity gave Assange a large platform to deny that the source of the DNC and John Podesta emails was the Russian government, and to also join Hannity in some fairly typical bashing of Hillary Clinton and the  liberal  mainstream media. Hannity gushed on-air. Thanks to Assange and WikiLeaks s work, Hannity said,  we can now fix the problem  of our gaps in U.S. cybersecurity. (The DNC and Podesta emails were a wake-up call, in a sense.) Assange also  exposed the corruption in our government  for all to see.  I have so many questions for you,  Hannity said, before reminding his audience of WikiLeaks s  perfect  record:  You have not been proven wrong, not one single time,  he reiterated. When asked if President Obama was trying to  delegitimize Donald Trump by promoting any evidence of Russian interference and cyberattacks aimed at helping Trump to defeat Clinton in the election) Assange answered firmly,  yes.   This wouldn t be the first time that the CIA would be politicized,  Hannity continued, making a Benghazi analogy. Assange also wagged his finger at  the liberal press  in America that tried to make Trump voters feel  ashamed  of themselves for supporting the Republican candidate.  What is the difference between what you and WikiLeaks have done, and what The New York Times and CNN [have done]?  the host inquired.  Our stuff has more impact,  Assange replied.  Touch ,  Hannity answered.  I can t disagree with that.  The conservative host continued to make the case that the so-called mainstream media was  trying to scapegoat  Assange, and that  if [Hillary] were a Republican they d be singing your praises day and night.

It s very clear that they conspired to frame the incoming president of the United States.DIGENOVA S WIFE VICTORIA TOENSING IS REPRESENTING A FORMER FBI INFORMANT WHO HAS THE GOODS ON THE URANIUM ONE DEAL: DC lawyer Victoria Toensing is one smart cookie. She s representing a former FBI informant who has evidence on kickbacks and bribery involving the transportation of uranium in the US. She recently told Sean Hannity her client will brief Congress about Russian involvement in the U.S. uranium market. This includes widespread bribery and actions that involved the Clintons https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDVndQRW22Q I m not going into detail,  attorney Victoria Toensing said on the Oct. 24 Hannity.  You know that, Sean. But the informant will give an overview and specific conversations that he had with Russians in what they were thinking about the money that they were spending. I mean, let me just be that general and it involves the Clintons. The director of the FBI at that time was Robert Mueller, and he is now the special counsel investigating alleged Russian collusion with the 2016 Trump campaign. The undercover investigation involving Toensing s client occurred between 2009 and 2014, and the senior attorney on the case was Rod Rosenstein, who is now the deputy attorney general of the United States and the official who appointed Mueller as special counsel.Further, all this information indicates that many senior Obama administration officials knew about instances of bribery and money laundering involving at least one Russian official, at a time when Russia wanted to expand its uranium market in the United States, and when the administration through a special committee had to approve or deny the sale of a company, Vancouver-based Uranium One, to Rosatom. (Rosatom is the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation.)Some of the people on that Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States included then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Attorney General Eric Holder, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napalitano, and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.The committee approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom in October 2010. That sale gave Russia, and President Vladimir Putin, control over 20% of U.S. uranium production. (At least nine investors in Uranium One   prior to, during, and after that sale   donated $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.) So, Mueller, [Rod] Rosenstein, maybe even [James] Comey at the time, and the president of the United States   certainly Eric Holder was the head of the DOJ   they all knew that they had all this evidence that the Russians had infiltrated with the purpose of a criminal enterprise to corner the market on uranium, the foundational material of nuclear weapons?  asked Hannity.Toensing said,  That is correct.

"Dec 16, 2016","A new report from Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy analyzes news coverage during the 2016 general election, and concludes that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump received coverage that was overwhelmingly negative in tone and extremely light on policy.This is the final report of a multi-part research series analyzing news coverage of candidates and issues during the 2016 presidential election. The study tracks news coverage from the second week of August 2016 to the day before Election Day.Negative coverage was the order of the day in the general election. Not a week passed where the nominees  coverage reached into positive territory. It peaked at 81 percent negative in mid-October, but there was not a single week where it dropped below 64 percent negative.The press s negative bent is not confined to election politics (see Figure 4).[2] In recent years, when immigration has been the subject of news stories, the ratio of negative stories to positive ones has been 5-to-1. In that same period, news reports featuring Muslims have been 6-to-1 negative. News stories about health care policy, most of which centered on the 2010 Affordable Care Act, have been 2-to-1 negative. Although the nation s economy has steadily improved since the financial crisis of 2008, one would not know that from the tone of news coverage. Since 2010, news stories about the nation s economy have been 2-to-1 negative over positive.The real bias of the press is not that it s liberal. Its bias is a decided preference for the negative. As scholar Michael Robinson noted, the news media seem to have taken some motherly advice and turned it upside down.  If you don t have anything bad to say about someone, don t say anything at all. [3] A New York Times columnist recently asserted that  the internet is distorting our collective grasp on the truth. [4] There s a degree of accuracy in that claim but the problem goes beyond the internet and the talk shows. The mainstream press highlights what s wrong with politics without also telling us what s right.It s a version of politics that rewards a particular brand of politics. When everything and everybody is portrayed as deeply flawed, there s no sense making distinctions on that score, which works to the advantage of those who are more deeply flawed. Civility and sound proposals are no longer the stuff of headlines, which instead give voice to those who are skilled in the art of destruction. The car wreck that was the 2016 election had many drivers. Journalists were not alone in the car, but their fingerprints were all over the wheel.The research is confined to the election coverage in the print editions of five daily papers (the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and USA Today) and the main newscasts of five television networks (ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN s The Situation Room, Fox s Special Report, and NBC Nightly News). In the case of the newspapers, the analysis covers all sections except sports, obituaries, and letters to the editor. Op-eds and editorials are included, but letters from the public are not. For television, the analysis covers the full daily content of each network s major newscast. Network talk shows are not included.Trump s general election news coverage fit the pattern of earlier stages of the campaign in several respects but not all. The major departure was that his general election coverage was overwhelmingly negative in tone. In our earlier reports, we documented the positive coverage Trump received during the nominating stage of the campaign, a pattern largely attributable to the press s tendency to highlight the horserace in the pre-primary and primary periods. As Trump rose from single digits in the polls and then won key primaries, he got favorable press. It was a story of growing momentum, rising poll numbers, ever larger crowds, and electoral success. The fact that the horse race is the most heavily covered aspect of the nominating phase magnified Trump s favorable coverage.Trump s general election coverage was a stark contrast. His coverage was negative from the start, and never came close to entering positive territory (see Figure 8).  During his best weeks, the coverage ran 2-to-1 negative over positive. In his worst weeks, the ratio was more than 10-to-1. If there was a silver lining for Trump, it was that his two best weeks were the ones just preceding the November balloting. Trump s coverage was negative in all the news outlets in our study, even those that typically side with the Republican nominee (see Figure 9). Fox provided Trump his most favorable coverage, but it was still nearly 3-to-1 negative over positive. The Wall Street Journal was his next best outlet, but its coverage ran 4-to-1 negative. The most negative coverage was carried by CBS at 9-to-1, but Trump s coverage was nearly as negative in most other outlets.Compare to Hillary s coverage:To be sure, changes in journalism are not the only reason that campaigns have become more negative. The party polarization that has seeped into American politics during the past three decades has been accompanied by rising levels of partisan attack. But to claim that party polarization explains the media s negative bent is to ignore the fact that the press s negativity is not confined to party politics. There s barely an aspect of public life that is not subject to intense criticism.A healthy dose of negativity is unquestionably a good thing. There s a lot of political puffery, ineptitude, and manipulation that needs to be exposed, and journalists would be shirking their duty if they failed to expose it. Yet an incessant stream of criticism has a corrosive effect. It needlessly erodes trust in political leaders and institutions and undermines confidence in government and policy.Negative news has partisan consequences. Given that journalists bash both sides, it might be thought the impact would be neutral. It s not. For one thing, indiscriminate criticism has the effect of blurring important distinctions. Were the allegations surrounding Clinton of the same order of magnitude as those surrounding Trump? It s a question that journalists made no serious effort to answer during the 2016 campaign. They reported all the ugly stuff they could find, and left it to the voters to decide what to make of it. Large numbers of voters concluded that the candidates  indiscretions were equally disqualifying and made their choice, not on the candidates  fitness for office, but on less tangible criteria in some cases out of a belief that wildly unrealistic promises could actually be kept.For entire story and study: Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy","OBAMA BLAMES RUSSIA For Hillary’s Loss, But NEW HARVARD STUDY Exposes Who REALLY Interfered In Outcome Of Our Elections"
"Dec 16, 2017","There are conflicting reports about why the outrageous Omarosa Manigault Newman is leaving her undefined job at the White House. It was first reported that she was escorted out of the White House by Secret Service after General Kelly had enough of her nonsense, and fired her. Omarosa appeared on Good Morning America the following day to refute those claims, saying she resigned from her job and was not fired or escorted out of the White House as reported. So who is Omarosa, and why is she such a polarizing figure? Does this 2006 video that just emerged offer any clues?A pop-culture polymath sent Page Six a link to  Soul Sistahs,  an ultra-camp, hyper-kitsch, uber-low-budget 10-minute sci-fi short film.While the plot is virtually incomprehensible, as far as we can tell it focuses on an intergalactic yenta in a housecoat who kidnaps Omarosa in an attempt to steal Donald Trump s hair as part of a difficult-to-understand get-rich-quick scheme.The mini-flick was made back in 2006   two years after Omarosa shot to fame on Trump s NBC show  The Apprentice. In this vaguely  Barbarella -inspired work, the aging villain drugs Omarosa by feeding her spiked cake, whereupon the red PVC-clad former director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison goes off on a motorcycle to steal the future president s hair in a showdown on top of a CGI-created Trump Tower.The film, which has been viewed a mere 6,000 times   as our source put it:  It s a cult classic.

"Dec 17, 2015","No dumb ass  we are actually NOT all Muslims! Last time I checked we were still a majority Christian nation, and no leftist clown is going to tell us otherwise!One thing you can say about Michael Moore he s consistently on the wrong side of every issue. The Left is more than happy to line his pockets, as long as he represents an anti-American position.Hyper-liberal Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker Michael Moore challenged Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump by holding a sign reading  We Are All Muslim  outside Trump Tower on Wednesday before penning an open letter to the candidate on Facebook.In his letter, Moore, who recently offered his Michigan apartment to Syrian refugees before inviting his fans to open their own homes, claimed he and Trump met on a talk show in 1998 and the billionaire businessman had asked him not to  go after  him. I thought, what are we, in 3rd grade?  Moore wrote.  I was struck by how you, a self-described tough guy from Queens, seemed like such a fraidey-cat. You and I went on to do the show. Nothing untoward happened between us. I didn t pull on your hair, didn t put gum on your seat.  What a wuss,  was all I remember thinking as I left the set. Moore added that Trump is now similarly afraid of Muslims, after proposing a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration to America  until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on. Moore wrote:And now, here we are in 2015 and, like many other angry white guys, you are frightened by a bogeyman who is out to get you. That bogeyman, in your mind, are all Muslims. Not just the ones who have killed, but ALL MUSLIMS.Fortunately, Donald, you and your supporters no longer look like what America actually is today. We are not a country of angry white guys. Here s a statistic that is going to make your hair spin: Eighty-one percent of the electorate who will pick the president next year are either female, people of color, or young people between the ages of 18 and 35. In other words, not you. And not the people who want you leading their country.The filmmaker then asked Trump to  leave the rest of us alone so we can elect a real president who is both compassionate and strong. We are all Muslim. Deal with it,  Moore concluded.Moore has become increasingly vocal about his dislike for the Republican frontrunner; last week, he invited Facebook followers to report Trump for  hate speech  in an effort to have him banned from the social media service.In an interview with the Daily Beast the day before his latest stunt, Moore said Trump should embrace his  female side. All men have estrogen in them. We all have a bit of estrogen in us. Sometimes, I ve noticed in our gender the guys who have to do a lot of huffing and puffing, they may be better embracing the female side of themselves,  Moore told the outlet.  They may be a little happier. He might be one of those people.

Sweden is, so to speak, the future of Europe. And in this future, those who can afford it pay security companies   the rest gest license for firearms and forms vigilante groups. via: Pamela Gellar You have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places.    Salesman for alarm systems.Since Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by over 300% and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The violence at the hands of Muslim migrants  is nothing new to Sweden. This horrific video was published in 2013:Many Swedes see the mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him, even though he beats her and treats her badly. Her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated?    Alexandra von Schwerin, whose farm who was robbed three times. Police refused to help.Once upon a time, there was a safe welfare state called Sweden, where people rarely locked their doors.Now, this country is a night-watchman state   each man is on his own. When the Minister of Justice, Morgan Johansson, encourages breaking the law, it means opening the gates to anarchy. Mr. and Mrs. Swede have every reason to be worried, with the influx of 190,000 unskilled and unemployed migrants expected this year   equivalent to 2% of Sweden s current population. The number is as if 6.4 million penniless migrants who did not speak English arrived in U.S. in one year, or 1.3 million in Britain.And the Swedes are preparing: demand for firearms licenses is increasing; more and more Swedes are joining shooting clubs and starting vigilante groups. After a slight dip in 2014, the number of new gun permits has gone up significantly again this year. According to police statistics, there are 1,901,325 licensed guns, owned by 567,733 people, in Sweden. Add to this an unknown number of illegal weapons. To get a gun permit in Sweden, you need to be at least 18 years old; law-abiding; well-behaved, and have a hunting license or be a member of an approved shooting club. In 2014, 11,000 people got a hunting license: 10% more than the year before. One out of five was a woman. There is also a high demand for alarm systems right now,  says a salesman at one of the security companies in an interview with Gatestone. It is largely due to the turbulence we are seeing around the country at the moment.  People have lost confidence in the State, he added.  The police will not come anymore. Truck drivers say that when they see a thief emptying the fuel tank of their trucks, they run out with a baseball bat. It is no use calling the police, but if you hit the thief, you can at least prevent him from stealing more diesel. Many homeowners say the same thing: they sleep with a baseball bat under the bed. But this is risky: the police can then say you have been prepared to use force, and that might backfire on you. The salesman, who asked to remain anonymous, also spoke of Sweden s many Facebook groups, in which people in different villages openly discuss how they intend to protect themselves:  Sometimes you get totally freaked out when you see what they are writing. But you have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places. One blog, detailing the consequences for the local population when an asylum facility opens, is aptly named Asylkaos ( Asylum Chaos ). There is a list of companies the reader is prompted to boycott; the blog claims these businesses encourage the transformation of Sweden to a multicultural society, and are therefore considered  hostile to Swedes. At another security company, a salesman said that every time the Immigration Service buys or rents a new housing facility, his firm is swamped with calls.  The next day,  he said,  half the village calls and wants to buy alarm systems. Ronny Fredriksson, spokesman of the security company Securitas, said that the demand for home alarm systems first exploded about six years ago, when many local police stations were shut down and police moved to the main towns. This, he said, could result in response times of several hours.  More and more people now employ the services of our security guards. Shopping malls and stores in the city come together and hire guards. We are kind of like the  local beat  cops of old. Even though Securitas makes big money from the increased need for home security alarms and security guards, Fredriksson says they also are worried about the effect on society: The problem is that we too need the police. When our guards catch a burglar or a violent person, we call the police but the response times are often very long. Sometimes, the detainees get violent and quite rowdy. On occasion, the police have told us to release the person we have apprehended, if we have his identity, because they do not have a patrol nearby. Even before the massive influx of migrants in the fall of 2015, Swedes felt a need to protect themselves   and with good reason. Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by more than 300%, and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The politicians, however, ignore the people s fear completely. It is never discussed. Instead, the people who express concern about what kind of country Sweden has become are accused of xenophobia and racism. Most likely, that is the reason more and more people are taking matters into their own hands, and protecting themselves and their families to the best of their ability.All the same, some people do not settle for that. It seems some people are trying to stop mass immigration to Sweden. Almost every day there are reports of fires being set at asylum houses. So far, miraculously, no one has been hurt.These fires are set not only by Swedes. On October 13, a 36-year-old woman living in Skellefte  was convicted of setting fire to the asylum facility in which she herself resided. The woman claimed she lit a candle and then fell asleep. Yet forensic evidence showed that a combustible fluid had been doused throughout the room, and the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that she herself had ignited the fire.The number of violent incidents at Sweden s Immigration Service facilities is now sky-high. In 2013, according to Dispatch International, at least one incident happened every day. When Gatestone Institute recently acquired the incident list for January 1, 2014 through October 29, 2015, that number had risen to 2,177 incidents of threats, violence and brawls   on average, three per day.The Swedish government, however, would apparently rather not talk about that. Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr m conceded, in an interview with the daily Dagens Nyheter that garnered international attention, that Sweden is, in fact, heading for a systemic breakdown: Most people seem to think we cannot maintain a system where perhaps 190,000 people will arrive every year. In the long run, our system will collapse. This welcome is not going to receive popular support. We want to give people who come here a worthy reception. Symptomatic of Swedish journalists, this statement was tucked away at the end of the article. The headline was about how the political party that is critical of immigration, the Sweden Democrats Party (Sverigedemokraterna), is responsible for the asylum-housing fires. But foreign media, such as The Daily Mail and Russia Today, picked up Wallstr m s warning about a systemic collapse and ran it as the urgent news it actually is.Nevertheless, in official Sweden, the imminent collapse is ignored. Instead, journalists exclusively focus on attacks by supposedly  racist  Swedes on refugee centers. To prevent new fires, the Immigration Service decided on October 28 that from now on, all asylum facilities would have secret addresses. And meager police resources will now be stretched even further   to protect asylum seekers. Police helicopters will even patrol refugee centers. But considering there are only five helicopters available, and that Sweden s landmass is 407,340 square km (157,274 square miles), this gesture is effectively empty.At a meeting with the Nordic Council in Reykjavik, Iceland, on October 27, Sweden s Prime Minister, Stefan L fven, was questioned by his Nordic colleagues about the situation in Sweden. L fven had recently said that,  We should have the option of relocating people applying for asylum in Sweden to other EU-countries. Our ability, too, has a limit. We are facing a paradigm shift.  That comment led a representative of Finland s Finns Party (Sannfinl ndarna) to wonder, with a hint of irony, how mass immigration to Sweden, which for years Swedish politicians have touted as being so profitable, has now suddenly become a burden.Another Finns Party representative, Simon Elo, pointed out that the situation in Sweden is out of control.  Sweden has great abilities, but not even the Swedes have abilities that great,  Elo said.When L fven was asked how he is dealing with the real concerns and demands of the citizenry, his answer was laconic:  Of course I understand there is concern,  L fven said.  It is not easy. But at the same time   there are 60 million people on the run. This is also about them being our fellow men, and I hope that viewpoint will prevail. The daily tabloid Expressen asked L fven about the attacks on asylum facilities. He replied,  Our communities should not be characterized by threats and violence, they should be warm and show solidarity. As if such behavior can be forced.Many Swedes see mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him even though he beats her and treats her badly. And on top of that, her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him.More and more Swedish commentators are now drawing the same conclusion: that Sweden is teetering on the brink of collapse. Editorial columnist Ivar Arpi of the daily Svenska Dagbladet, wrote an astonishing article on October 26, about a woman named Alexandra von Schwerin and her husband. The couple lives on the Skarhults Estate farm in Sk ne in southern Sweden; they have been robbed three times. Most recently, they were robbed of a quad bike, a van and a car. When the police arrived, von Schwerin asked them what she should do. The police told her that they could not help her.  All our resources are on loan to the asylum reception center in Trelleborg and Malm ,  they said.  We are overloaded right now. So I suggest you get in touch with the vigilante group in Esl v. What the police had called a  vigilante group  turned out to be a group of private business owners. In 2013, after being robbed more or less every night, they had decided to come together and start patrolling the area themselves. Currently, they pay a security firm to watch their facilities. On principal, I am totally against it,  von Schwerin said.  What are the people who cannot afford private security to do? They will be unprotected. I m sure I will join, but very, very reluctantly. For the first time, I feel scared to live here now. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated? Commenting on the police s encouraging people to join vigilante groups, social commentator and former Refugee Ombudsman Merit Wager wrote: So, the Swedes are supposed to arrange and pay for their own and their families  security and keep their farms from being subjected to theft, even though that has up to now been included in the social contract   for which we pay high taxes, to have police we can count on to protect us and apprehend criminals?! When did the social contract expire? October 2015? Without any notice of termination, since the tax-consuming party is not fulfilling its part of the deal? This should mean that our part of the deal   to pay taxes for public, joint services   has also become invalid? If the social contract is broken, it is broken. Then it is musical chairs (lawlessness, defenselessness, without protection), and that means that each and every one of us should pay less taxes. Ilan Sad , lawyer and social commentator, wrote about the refugee chaos at Malm  Central Train Station on the blog Det Goda Samh llet on October 27:  The authorities no longer honor the social contract.  He described four large signs on display around the station that read  Refugee? Welcome to Malm !  in four different languages. It is unclear who the sender of the message is, or, for that matter, who is in charge of the reception facility   a number of barracks by the old post office in the inner harbor. Everything is utterly confusing. It could be Malm  City or the Immigration Service, but it might as well be  Refugees Welcome,  or possibly a religious community. I think to myself that a government agency could not reasonably write like this, a correct and pertinent sign would say something like:  Asylum seekers are referred to the barracks for information and further transport.  But I am probably wrong; Malm  City is the chief suspect communicant.   The signs in and around the Central Station are symptoms of something incredibly serious: Role confusion and the decay of the constitutional state. And thus, that our authorities no longer honor the social contract. In a post called Anarchy, blogger Johan Westerholm, who is a Social Democratic Party member and a critic of the government, wrote that the Minister for Justice and Migration, Morgan Johansson, is now urging authorities to  be pragmatic  about laws and regulations (concerning asylum housing for so-called unaccompanied refugee children). Westerholm stated that this is tantamount to the government  opening the gates to anarchy : Our country is founded on law; Parliament legislates and the courts apply these. Morgan Johansson s statement and his otherwise passive approach are testimony to how this, our kind of democracy, may fade into a memory very shortly. He now laid the first brick in the building of a state that rests on other principles. Anarchism. If anarchy really does break out, it would be good to remember that there are nearly two million licensed firearms in Sweden. Sweden s shooting clubs have seen a surge in interest; many are welcoming a lot of new members lately.

Reading our short memo could save the Senate from endemic partisanship, expense and unnecessary delay.In what follows, we draw on decades of senior-level experience   with emphasis on cyber-intelligence and security   to cut through uninformed, largely partisan fog. Far from hiding behind anonymity, we are proud to speak out with the hope of gaining an audience appropriate to what we merit   given our long labors in government and other areas of technology. And corny though it may sound these days, our ethos as intelligence professionals remains, simply, to tell it like it is   without fear or favor.We have gone through the various claims about hacking. For us, it is child s play to dismiss them. The email disclosures in question are the result of a leak, not a hack. Here s the difference between leaking and hacking:Leak: When someone physically takes data out of an organization and gives it to some other person or organization, as Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning did.Hack: When someone in a remote location electronically penetrates operating systems, firewalls or any other cyber-protection system and then extracts data.Even the head of U.S. intelligence   James Clapper   testified on Monday that the connection between Russia and Wikileaks is weak. And U.S. intelligence agencies are now refusing to brief the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on whether or not Russia was actually the source of the Wikileaks documents.And the NSA executive who created the agency s mass surveillance program for digital information, who served as the senior technical director within the agency, who managed six thousand NSA employees, the 36-year NSA veteran widely regarded as a  legend  within the agency and the NSA s best-ever analyst and code-breaker, who mapped out the Soviet command-and-control structure before anyone else knew how, and so predicted Soviet invasions before they happened ( in the 1970s, he decrypted the Soviet Union s command system, which provided the US and its allies with real-time surveillance of all Soviet troop movements and Russian atomic weapons )   told Washington s Blog that the Democratic emails were leaked by either NSA insiders or DNC insiders.The former intelligence analyst, British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, and chancellor of the University of Dundee (Craig Murray) revealed earlier this week that the Podesta leak and the DNC leak were leaked by two different insiders, that both of the leakers were Americans with no ties to Russia, and that one was from the American intelligence services.Subsequently, Murray revealed further details on the leaks.Specifically, in an interview with Scott Horton on Tuesday, Murray said that   because John Podesta s company is a registered lobbyist for the Saudi Arabian government   the NSA and other intelligence agencies were monitoring their emails as a matter of course.Murray said that an insider from an American intelligence service (read: NSA) leaked the Podesta emails to Wikileaks. Indeed, an intermediary to the NSA whistleblower handed the emails to Murray in a park in Washington, D.C.Murray said that Wikileaks head Julian Assange tells him that the leaker of the DNC emails was a DNC insider.When asked if Seth Rich was the DNC leaker, Murray responded that he doesn t know   but that it s possible that Rich was murdered because someone thought that he was the source of the DNC leak.

Why is MSM covering this up? #Trump pic.twitter.com/FS297JooQI  ViveLaFrance (@vivelafra) December 11, 2016Again, NSA is able to identify both the sender and recipient when hacking is involved. Thanks largely to the material released by Edward Snowden, we can provide a full picture of NSA s extensive domestic data-collection network including Upstream programs like Fairview, Stormbrew and Blarney. These include at least 30 companies in the U.S. operating the fiber networks that carry the Public Switched Telephone Network as well as the World Wide Web. This gives NSA unparalleled access to data flowing within the U.S. and data going out to the rest of the world, as well as data transiting the U.S.In other words, any data that is passed from the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) or of Hillary Rodham Clinton (HRC)   or any other server in the U.S.   is collected by the NSA. These data transfers carry destination addresses in what are called packets, which enable the transfer to be traced and followed through the network.The bottom line is that the NSA would know where and how any  hacked  emails from the DNC, HRC or any other servers were routed through the network. This process can sometimes require a closer look into the routing to sort out intermediate clients, but in the end sender and recipient can be traced across the network.The various ways in which usually anonymous spokespeople for U.S. intelligence agencies are equivocating   saying things like  our best guess  or  our opinion  or  our estimate  etc.   shows that the emails alleged to have been  hacked  cannot be traced across the network. Given NSA s extensive trace capability, we conclude that DNC and HRC servers alleged to have been hacked were, in fact, not hacked.The evidence that should be there is absent; otherwise, it would surely be brought forward, since this could be done without any danger to sources and methods. Thus, we conclude that the emails were leaked by an insider   as was the case with Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. Such an insider could be anyone in a government department or agency with access to NSA databases, or perhaps someone within the DNC.For entire story Washington s Blog",REVEALED: Who Gave Democratic Emails To Wikileaks And Why They Were A Leaker And NOT A Hacker [VIDEO]

Trump, one of the most successful businessmen of our time?After taking a stand for harmony and togetherness by wearing black sneaker and white sneakers with the word  Equality  written on them, to a game in Washington, DC, on Sunday night, NBA star LeBron James took a decidedly less conciliatory tone, in his post-game comments about President Trump.James said,  Obviously I ve been very outspoken and well-spoken about the situation that s going on at the helm here, and we re not going to let one person dictate us, us as Americans, how beautiful and how powerful we are as a people. It certainly was nice of James to add that he s been  well-spoken,  in addition to being outspoken.The three-time NBA champ and future Hall of Famer continued,  No matter the skin color, no matter the race, no matter who you are, I think we all have to understand that having equal rights and being able to stand for something and speak for something and keeping the conversation going. James did not elaborate on what rights he felt were in danger, nor did he explain exactly what  the conversation  was, or where it was going.However, James did speak from a place of unrivaled authority on the subject of being outspoken. In many ways, James has been the anti-Jordan, whereas MJ avoided political entanglements whenever possible, at least since 2012, James has embraced them whenever and wherever possible.James appeared in a photo with his teammates wearing hoodies in honor of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager shot to death by George Zimmerman in 2012.

"Dec 2, 2015","Is this why we worked so hard to get a GOP majority in the House and Senate? Spineless weasels Republican House members blasted their GOP leadership Wednesday for caving to Democratic leaders  demand that they abandon the House s bipartisan bill to tighten screening of refugee applicants from Syria and Iraq. The bill to bolster the Syrian and Iraqi [refugee] vetting process passed with a veto-proof majority and is supported by a vast majority of Americans,  said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC)57% , who is one of the two co-authors of the original House bill that GOP leaders are now abandoning. It would be a shame to bow to the wishes of Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) and the White House, leaving our country vulnerable to foreign terrorism,  he told Breitbart News exclusively.After the Paris attacks that killed over 120 people, the House passed a bill   with a huge bipartisan majority   that would implement tough screening requirements for refugees. The bill was criticized by Democrats and President Obama, who vowed to veto the legislation and suggested that Republicans work with them to tighten oversight of visas given to legal visitors.Now, House Republican leaders are reportedly planning to abandon their original idea to tighten screening of refugees and are instead caving to Democrats who want to only fix security gaps in the legal-visitor visa program.Republican House leadership is backing away from the refugee problem because they fear their fix will be rejected by Democrats and lead to a partial government shut-down.Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) also told Breitbart News exclusively that he isn t  surprised  that Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) is following in the steps of former House Speaker Rep. John Boehner (R-OH)32% by bowing to Democrats, rather than putting up a fight.He called the original vote  a show vote  that was arranged by the leaders, and told Breitbart News that the entire refugee program needs to be stripped of its funding.Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) told Breitbart News exclusively that GOP House leadership should fix both problems.  This should not be an either or question,  Babin said.  Both should be addressed in a timely manner. We should concern ourselves first and foremost with the safety and security of the American people. Babin recently released a letter, signed by more than 70 of his colleagues, calling on House leadership to include language in the must-pass omnibus spending bill that would defund the refugee resettlement program. More than 70 of my colleagues joined me in calling for an immediate suspension in the refugee program to give us time to put in place security measures that the Administration has failed to implement  Babin told Breitbart News. We must restore Congressional authority and ensure that Congress has a final sign-off on any Administration proposed Security measures. Congress has until December 11th to pass the omnibus bill.Via: Breitbart News",GOP HOUSE LEADERSHIP Place Political Careers Before National Security: Why They Are Reportedly Caving (Again) To Democrats
"Dec 2, 2017","What a bitter woman! She blames a different thing every week for her 2016 loss to President Trump. Everything she says below is a lie. She just makes it up as she goes along:  She went on to describe how  men who shaped the narrative  of the campaign harmed her but are now under fire for sexual harassment. Hillary Clinton thinks that former NBC host Matt Lauer s demise is  karma  for how he questioned her about her private email server during the 2016 presidential campaign.Clinton was in Philadelphia on Thursday promoting her campaign memoir, What Happened, when she was asked about Lauer being fired this week over allegations of sexual misconduct, the Philly Voice reported. Lauer faced a storm of criticism last year when several journalists and commentators deemed his questioning of Clinton at a candidate forum unfair and even sexist. Every day I believe more in karma,  Clinton said of Lauer.She went on to describe how  men who shaped the narrative  of the campaign harmed her but are now under fire for sexual harassment, echoing how her supporters have tied Lauer s alleged misconduct to his treatment of Clinton. She also repeated her past arguments about the election, primarily blaming a host of outside factors for her defeat. EXTENDED COUGHING FIT  IS THIS KARMA TOO?At one point early in the evening, Clinton launched into an extended coughing fit, the kind of thing that tended to lead to theories during the campaign that the candidate was concealing some sort of illness.

"Dec 20, 2017","Just a few months before reports of her sexual assault lawsuit against Donald Trump rocked the campaign, cosmetics executive Jill Harth lobbied to be the then-candidate s make-up artist.On Monday, The Hill detailed the story of Harth s repeated efforts to become Trump s campaign makeup artist and to pitch her new male cosmetics product line,  Made Man.  Her solicitations, in both emails and in person, came a few months before her 1997 lawsuit was brought to light, along with several other sexual misconduct allegations against the candidate. The Hill learned of her appeals to Trump in an interview with Harth in December about her friendship with celebrity attorney Lisa Bloom; Trump s lawyers then provided the emails. The Hill followed up with Harth, who defended both her attempts to work with the man she accused of sexual assault and her current call for him to be impeached.In 1997, Harth sued Trump for allegedly pushing her up against a wall and trying to get his hands up her dress during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in 1993. She eventually withdrew the lawsuit as part of a settlement over Trump allegedly pulling out of a business deal. But as The Hill notes, the tone of her emails to Trump in 2015 was  starkly different  than the tone of her 1997 lawsuit and the interviews she gave about it in 2016.The Hill provides some examples of the emails Harth personally sent to Trump between the summer of 2015 and early 2016: Hi Donald, you are doing a tremendous job of shaking things up in the United States. I am definitely on Team Trump as so many others are,  Jill Harth wrote the future president in an Oct. 1, 2015, email sent to him through his New York company s headquarters. I can t watch television without seeing you or hearing your name everywhere! It s a good thing for sure but PLEASE let me do your makeup for a television interview, a debate, a photo session, anything!  Harth wrote. It kills me to see you looking too orange and with white circles under the eyes. I will get your skin looking smoother and even toned,  she added, boasting she would  sculpt your face  to look good on high-definition television sets.The Hill also notes that Harth is one of the accusers who financially benefited from her work with Bloom on the allegations: the attorney set up a GoFundMe page for Harth that paid off her mortgage and an email revealed that Harth s sales soared after Bloom appeared on TV to discuss her allegations.  Daily WireBIG PAYDAYS FOR TRUMP ACCUSERS:According to FOX News, Legal powerhouse Lisa Bloom tried to line up big paydays for women who were willing to accuse President Trump of sexual misconduct during the final months of last year s election, according to an explosive report.Proud to call Attorney @LisaBloom my friend.

In one case, Bloom reportedly arranged for a donor to pay off one Trump accuser s mortgage and attempted to score a six-figure payment for another woman. The former ultimately declined to come forward after being offered $750,000, the clients told The Hill. ",OOPS!

"Dec 21, 2015","Never mind that Iran continues to violate Obama s lopsided deal Senior Obama administration officials are expressing concern that congressional attempts to tighten laws preventing terrorists from entering the United States could violate the Iran nuclear agreement and prompt Tehran to walk away from the agreement.Congress is considering measures that would tighten the Visa Waiver Program to make it harder for potential terrorists to legally enter the United States by increasing restrictions on individuals who have travelled to countries with prominent terrorist organizations from bypassing security checks upon entering the United States.Iranian officials have in recent days repeatedly issued threatening statements to the Obama administration, saying that such moves would violate the nuclear agreement, and the Obama administration last week conveyed the Iranian anger to American lawmakers.Stephen Mull, the State Department official in charge of implementing the Iran deal, warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee late last week that these congressional efforts  could have a very negative impact on the deal. Under the revised law, which came in the week of a deadly terrorist attack in California, individuals who have travelled to Iran a lead sponsor of global terrorism would no longer be eligible to participate in the Visa Waiver Program, which permits individuals from 38 partner nations to more easily enter the United States.Congress remains concerned that gaps in the program could prevent federal law enforcement officials from detecting terror-tied individuals before they are granted entrance to U.S. soil.However, a portion of the Iran nuclear deal mandates that the United States not take any action that could harm Iran s economic relationships with other countries. Iranian officials maintain that the new restrictions violate this passage of the deal.Ali Larijani, the speaker of Iran s parliament, said last week that these tightened measures  are aimed at harassment  and that they  blatantly violate the nuclear agreement,  according to comments carried by the Iranian state-controlled press.Larijani warned that this action will detonate the deal before it has even been implemented. If the Americans pursue the plan, they will destroy an achievement with their own hands since it is against the [nuclear deal] and it will trouble them,  he warned.Rep. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) echoed these concerns last week when he questioned Mull during a Senate hearing.Visa waiver reform efforts include  a naming of Iran such that individuals who have travelled to Iran will no loner be eligible for the visa waiver program,  Murphy said.  There has been a suggestion because there is an element of the agreement that obligates us to not to take steps that would stop economic relations between other nations and Iran that we could perhaps be in jeopardy of breaching the agreement. Mull agreed with this assessment. I have heard from very senior, and Secretary [of State John] Kerry has as well, from very senior officials of differing European allies of ours that it could have a very negative impact on the deal,  he said.Sources working with Congress on the Iran deal criticized the Obama administration for attempting to stymie increased action on terrorism due to its desire to preserve the nuclear deal. According to the Obama administration s latest interpretation, the nuclear deal allows Iran to test ballistic missiles in violation of international law, but does not allow Congress to prevent terrorists from coming into the United States,  Omri Ceren, the managing director of press and strategy at The Israel Project, a D.C.-based organization that works with journalists on Middle East issues, told the Washington Free Beacon.Seyed Araqchi, Iran s deputy foreign minister, also warned that Iran is prepared to  take action  against the United States for implementing visa restrictions.Iran s latest threat to break the deal comes amid numerous Iranian provocations, including multiple tests of advanced ballistic missiles, acts prohibited under United Nations Security Council resolutions.The Obama administration repeatedly said that, while it does not agree with those launches, they do not violate the nuclear deal.Via: WFB",OBAMA WARNS: Crackdown On Terrorism In U.S. Would Violate Iran Deal

"Dec 22, 2016","Two days before the Berlin killings resurrected the darkest period in his life, Conrad Leslie says an unexpected message from a stranger on Facebook gave him and his wife a comfort unlike anything they had experienced since their son, a UC Berkeley student, died in the Nice, France, terror attack in July.The message, Leslie said, put to rest a recurring nightmare the couple had: a vision of their son s body on the promenade, alone for hours. In fact, a woman and her daughter had surrounded Nicholas Leslie s body with candles and prayed for him throughout the night, Leslie learned. Instead of running in fear, they asked the police if they could stay,  said Leslie of Del Mar (San Diego County).  It was a cold night, and they stayed with his body. It was like a Christmas story for us   a miracle almost. The Facebook message came from a French woman whose mother vacations in Nice every year. She said her mother ran into two women   also a mother and daughter   who told the story of finding a young man s body along the promenade and staying with him until first responders came.The woman who learned the story read an article in Le Monde that quoted Leslie as saying no one was with his son. But based on the description of the young man s body and the location of where he died as reported in the newspaper, she connected the dots and told her daughter, who speaks English, to track Leslie down at once.After they connected on Facebook, Leslie says he is now trying to track down the mother and daughter who stayed with his son s body. I just know they exist, and we re going to find them,  he said.Nicholas Leslie (pictured above), 20, was in France for a study-abroad program through UC Berkeley, where he studied business and environmental sciences. In the summer program, students were encouraged to develop their startup ideas. His was to create a way to measure lactic acid generation in athletes in real time.On the night of July 14, Nicholas Leslie and his friends were strolling down the Promenade des Anglais along the Mediterranean. The group had planned to watch the Bastille Day fireworks and get to bed early for a trip the next morning to Barcelona, Spain.Leslie said his son, with a long striding gait, was about 10 feet in front of his friends, who dived down to the beach when a man driving a cargo truck intentionally ran over dozens of people, killing 86. One friend swore he saw Nick run away. Later we found out it was probably PTSD,  Leslie said.  But that helped us get the strength to go to Nice to look for him. The uncertainty and pain were recalled in vivid detail Monday when a similar truck attack in a bustling Christmas market in central Berlin killed 12 people and injured dozens. A huge manhunt continued Thursday as German officials worked to track down the attacker. It just brings back the moment for us as parents. We felt the desperation, the pain,  Leslie said.  It s a new world we live in, and it s terrible. Leslie, an engineer and mostly lapsed Catholic, said the writings on death by the 18th century scientist Emanuel Swedenborg helped him cope. Although he s bothered when people tell him that his son s death was God s will or that Nicholas Leslie is in a  better place,  Leslie said he takes comfort in Swedenborg s idea that two angels carried his son to heaven, embodied by the mother and daughter who prayed over him.THE FAMILY OF NICHOLAS CREATED A SCHOLARSHIP IN HIS NAME: Nicolos Leslie Memorial Fundraiser Read more: sfchronicle",‘MIRACLE’ CONNECTION For Parents Of College Student Killed By Terrorists In France And Heroic Strangers

"Dec 23, 2015","Americans should pay close attention to this story, especially after Loretta Lynch announced the US Government will punish anyone for anti-Muslim speech.Journalist and writer  ric Zemmour has once again been fined   this time 3,000 euros   for inciting to hate Muslims. Le Parisien reports:Polemicist Eric Zemmour was sentenced on Thursday to a fine of 3,000 euros for provoking hatred towards Muslims, as a result of comments he made to the Italian daily Corriere della Sera in October 2014. In particular, he declared that the Muslims  have their civil code, it s the Koran,  that they  live among themselves in the suburbs. The French are forced to leave.  The prosecution had asked for a fine of 10,000 euros. I believe we re heading for chaos. This situation of a people in the people, of Muslims in the French people, will lead us to chaos and to civil war,  he added.  Millions of persons live here, in France, but refuse to live in the French manner. ric Zemmour was at the time promoting his book Le Suicide fran ais.Note: First, the use of the term  polemicist  to describe Zemmour is a deliberate attempt by the media to emphasize his  warlike  nature and his refusal to debate. The word evokes hostility and single-mindedness. Second, Zemmour s reference to a possible civil war preceded by fourteen months the statement by Manuel Valls, between the two rounds of the regional elections, that an FN victory would lead to civil war. No one prosecuted Valls. Third, there is an implication that Zemmour s words were intended to provoke in order to sell more books, since he was on a book tour in Italy.During the hearing in the Paris criminal court, the polemicist had maintained that he was speaking of  the Muslims in the suburbs who organize and who are planning to secede.  Prosecutor Annabelle Philippe deemed that his remarks that she regarded as  stigmatizing and without nuance , were aimed at the  totality of the Muslim community.  The court agreed stating that at no point in the interview did he reduce his comments to  just a fraction  of Muslims. The whole of Zemmour s remarks  rests on an eminently divisive assumption: that the Muslim community, in its essence and its culture, is in opposition to the French and to the French people,  said the judges. Claiming to relate an ineluctable evolution,  ric Zemmour proposes to his readers the only option capable, in his eyes, of avoiding civil war: an organized and forced departure from France of the entire Muslim community.  The court lambasted his  warlike and catastrophe-prone semantics  that denote  the conceptual passage from a probable reality to a solution at once credible and desirable. Note: So it is a crime in France to express a  credible  solution to a  probable  reality? It s a crime to even envisage a chaotic situation caused by Islamic doctrine?His lawyer Olivier Pardo, who plans to appeal, reacted:  The remarks made by  ric Zemmour before the November 13 attacks are today shared by a large part of those who voice their opinion. I cannot help but note the relentlessness to which he was subjected. The polemicist was also condemned to pay one or one thousand euros, depending on the case, in damages to the associations comprising the plaintiffs. To that will be added court costs, for a total of 13,003 euros.Note: Criminal and civil trials are combined here. While we would have a separate civil suit, in France the damages are meted out in the criminal court.The judges  decision  again has recognized that  ric Zemmour is a propagator of hatred,  deemed Sabrina Goldman, attorney for LICRA (International League against Racism and Antisemitism).  His words are all the more dangerous because he presents himself as the apostle of truth; he claims to tell the truth when in fact he only expresses hatred,  she declared. The president of SOS Racism, Dominique Sopo, expressed satisfaction that the justice system had reminded us that  freedom of expression is not freedom to spread hatred . He also said:  It makes you wonder again how he can hold such a position of authority in the media.

Those words were written by former National Security Adviser Susan Rice on Thursday in the New York Times, in arguing for appeasement towards Kim Jong-un.It was also the perfect symbol of everything that was wrong with Barack Obama s feckless foreign policy   and it explains why the world that President Donald Trump inherited is so dangerous and unstable.The Obama administration believed it was worth living in the shadow of terror and nuclear aggression as long as the U.S. could maintain a dignified posture that could not provoke anyone.  BreitbartNoah Rothman of Commentary Magazine wrote a brilliant article about the  death rattle of Obama s reputation . In his article, Rothman reminds us of the ineffective and dangerous path former President Barack Obama took our nation down, and why the successes of President Trump are forcing his corrupt inner circle to speak out against Trump in defense of Obama s failed legacy.The members of Barack Obama s administration in exile have become conspicuously noisy of late even more so than usual. Former CIA Director John Brennan accused Donald Trump and his administration of engaging in  outrageous,   narcissistic  behavior typical of  vengeful autocrats  by threatening proportionate retaliation against countries that voted to condemn the United States in the United Nations, as though that were unprecedented. It is not. James Clapper, Obama s director of national intelligence, all but alleged that the president is a Russian  asset.  Perhaps the most acerbic and incendiary series of accusations from the former Democratic president s foreign-policy professionals were placed in the New York Times by Obama s national security advisor, Susan Rice. In her estimation, America has abdicated its role as a  force for good. Rice s attacks on the Republican administration deserve the most attention, if only because they are the most apoplectic. Donald Trump s recently released national-security review paints a  dark,   almost dystopian  vision of the world, Rice contended. His world is full of  hostile states and lurking threats.  Rice claimed that there is  no common good  in Trump s worldview. What s more, there is no  international community  and no  universal values.  There are just  American values. Rice acknowledges that Moscow is a threat to regional stability and peace,  Western values,  and U.S. sovereignty. She implies that Trump is a menace because he declines to recognize that. In fact, it was Obama much more so than Trump who has failed to see the obvious.Barack Obama was inarguably the least Atlanticist president since the end of World War II. Within a year of Russia s brazen invasion and dismemberment of the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, Obama scrapped George W. Bush-era agreements to move radar and missile interceptor installations to Central Europe. In 2013, the last of America s armored combat units left Europe, ending a 69-year footprint on the Continent. By 2014, there were just two U.S. Army brigades stationed in Europe. The folly of this demobilization became abundantly clear when Vladimir Putin became the first Russian leader since Stalin to invade and annex territory in neighboring Ukraine.A year later, Putin intervened militarily in Syria, where U.S. forces were already operating, resulting in the most dangerous escalation of tensions between the two nuclear powers since the end of the Cold War. Putin s move in Syria should not have come as a surprise; Barack Obama outsourced the resolution of the Syrian conflict to Moscow in 2013, if only to avoid making good on his self-set  red line  for intervention in that conflict despite the norm-shattering use of WMDs on civilians. Even Rice s chief complaint about Trump, his failure to condemn Putin s brazen intervention in the 2016 election, didn t elicit a reaction from Barack Obama until the final month of his presidency.By contrast, and to the surprise of just about everyone, the Trump administration has been tough on Russia. Trump has ordered harsh sanctions on Moscow s Iranian allies for violating United Nations resolutions a course the Obama administration declined to take even if it allowed Hezbollah terrorists with direct links to Putin to operate with impunity. He ordered long overdue airstrikes on Putin s vassal regime in Syria, halting any further use of chemical weapons in the process. Trump not only declined to lift Obama-era sanctions on Moscow, as many feared he would, but expanded them. This administration closed Russian consulates and annexes in the United States. It has targeted Putin allies like Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov under the Magnitsky Act the same act that Kremlin cutout Natalia Veselnitskaya lobbied the Trump campaign to scuttle. Trump has even gone so far as to open U.S. arms sales to Ukraine, representing a significant blow to Putin s ambitions in Europe. It is without a doubt that Trump now has a stronger record on Russia than Barack Obama ever did. No wonder Susan Rice is so angry.Rice further alleged that Trump recklessly accused China of being an  avowed opponent  of the U.S. rather than just a competitor, and then insisted that China has not  illegally occupied its neighbors.  Tell that to Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, or Taiwan, each of which lay claim to strategic territory in the South China Sea that the People s Republic seized and turned into forward air and naval bases. Rice suggested that Trump s  realists  decided to  lump  Beijing in with Moscow, not because it is a rising military and economic power, but because they wanted to  placate  American nationalists. Though this White House declined to defibrillate the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement back to life when it inherited its corpse, it has done a far more comprehensive job of working with Beijing to isolate Pyongyang than Obama did. As the North Korean nuclear crisis intensifies, China has backed fresh sanctions on North Korean financial institutions, cut off all access to Chinese iron, lead, and coal, and may even scale back petroleum deliveries to the Stalinist state by as much as 90 percent. And all in the space of one year.Rice contended that the document failed to itemize the discrete identities on whose behalf the U.S. should labor: LGBT people, people in poverty, people with AIDS, people under 30, et cetera. Rather, the document insists that all mankind, regardless of conditions or accidents of birth, are objects of U.S. interest. Rice complained that climate change is no longer viewed as a threat to national security. Good. Climate change is not itself a threat to American national security but a threat multiplier, as the weather has always been. Save for some valid concerns about the prospect of an overly restrictive immigration policy and the precariousness of U.S. free-trade obligations, Rice painted a picture not of a radical administration but one that is returning to a familiar status quo ante. In nearly all respects, it was Obama s White House, not Trump s, that adopted an ideological foreign policy and rendered the U.S. and the world less safe as a result.Even as early as March of 2017, it was clear that the Obama administration s foreign-policy professionals were quite insecure about how posterity would remember their stewardship of American interests abroad. They had every reason to be. For now, at least, the Trump administration has declined to govern as Trump campaigned; not as a populist firebrand but a conventional Republican. Susan Rice and her former White House colleagues have every reason to worry, but not for the United States. Their reputations, however, are another matter entirely.To read the entire article, click here. ",WHY OBAMA’S CORRUPT INNER CIRCLE Is Desperately Fighting To Protect His Failed Reputation

"Dec 24, 2017","The LA Times is reporting that moviegoing is at the lowest level since 1995. The article blames Americans who are going to see fewer movies, on streaming services, which, to some extent, could be true, but from the majority of the comments we ve seen on our Facebook page, which reaches almost 1.7 million followers, Americans are no longer interested in paying their hard-earned money to support the anti-American and anti-Trump hate machine that is Hollywood. While there are a few openly conservative actors in Hollywood, the majority of them are swimming in a cesspool of liberalism and are consumed with hate for President Trump and his deplorable supporters.  From George Clooney trashing Trump over his stance on refugees coming to America from Muslim hotbed nations, to Meryl Streep using a televised award ceremony to trash our newly inaugurated President, to has-been pop stars like Madonna saying she d like to blow up the White House; America has had it up to their eyeballs with people who are some of America s top earners, thanks to the support of people they openly mock for supporting President Trump.  The LA Times reports, that Hollywood is celebrating the end of 2017 with astronomical sales from  Star Wars: The Last Jedi,  which is on track to soon exceed $1 billion in global ticket sales and eventually become the biggest movie of the year. But that won t be enough to write a happy storyline for the industry.Although movie ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada are expected to dip just below last year s record of $11.38 billion, the number of tickets sold is projected to drop 4% to 1.26 billion   the lowest level since 1995, according to preliminary estimates from studio executives.The falloff in ticket sales can mostly be explained by a handful of movies that flopped, especially during the dreary summer season that posted the worst results in more than two decades. Even such massive hits as  Wonder Woman,   Thor: Ragnarok  and  It  couldn t make up for a lackluster summer lineup populated by rickety franchises ( Alien: Covenant ) and poorly reviewed retreads ( The Mummy ).However, the long-term decline in attendance reflects systemic challenges facing the industry. Audiences are spending less time going to the movies and are consuming more entertainment on small screens and through streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon that are spending billions on original video content.Sorry to burst your liberal bubble, but now that the curtain has been pulled back, the deplorable crowd isn t interested in supporting hate-filled, liberal Hollywood.

"Dec 25, 2015","So Bill Clinton wants a third term so much that he s coming out to battle Trump. Bringing Bill Clinton in to fight Hillary s battles could be a double edged sword. She might gain some momentum but it s hard to believe that Trump won t come after them with some zingers. The problem with the zingers is that they might earn Hillary some sympathy from the voters. I say that she should fight her own battles but don t you know Bill would love to be sitting in the White House a year from now  A new and more combative phase of Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign opens next month when she sends her husband out to stump for her in important early states.Waiting for him will be businessman Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner.The former president has been a low-key figure since Mrs. Clinton entered the race for the Democratic nomination in April, offering private advice and helping her raise money at closed-door fundraisers. In January, the campaign intends to showcase him in public forums in Iowa and New Hampshire, two states where the front-runner is locked in a tight race against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.Speaking to supporters recently, Mrs. Clinton described her husband as a  secret weapon. Throwing Mr. Clinton into the mix could further escalate the rhetoric between the Trump and Clinton campaigns. In the 2008 presidential race, the former president would bristle at criticism directed at his wife and got in hot water when he suggested Barack Obama s victory in the South Carolina primary was less significant because of the large African-American vote.This past week saw back-and-forth volleys over whether comments Mr. Trump made about Mrs. Clinton were sexist. He said Mr. Obama  schlonged  her in the 2008 race and said her brief absence from a recent Democratic debate stage, when she was reportedly using the restroom, was  disgusting. In an interview with the Des Moines Register, Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump has  demonstrated a penchant for sexism.  That drew a response from Mr. Trump on Twitter:  Hillary, when you complain about  a penchant for sexism,  who are you referring to. I have great respect for women.    In capital letters he then wrote,  BE CAREFUL! Asked what Mr. Trump meant, his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said:  Mr. Trump speaks for Mr. Trump and his tweets speak for themselves. And he s very clear about what those tweets say. Another Trump spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, suggested in an interview with CNN that the Trump campaign intends to make Mr. Clinton s behavior an issue should Mrs. Clinton pursue this point. Mr. Clinton, during his presidency, paid $850,000 to settle a sexual harassment case brought by Paula Jones stemming from an encounter when he was governor of Arkansas. His affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky led to his impeachment by the U.S. House in 1998. He was acquitted by the Senate the following year. Hillary Clinton has some nerve to talk about the war on women and the bigotry toward women when she has a serious problem in her husband,  Ms. Pierson told CNN. Representatives for Mr. Clinton and the Clinton campaign declined to comment.Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead among Democrats nationally, but polling shows the contests in Iowa and New Hampshire are up for grabs. Losses in both states could potentially alter the dynamics of a race she is dominating.In a conference call with supporters this past week, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said that Mrs. Clinton was in a  dog fight  in New Hampshire.Via: WSJ",Will Hillary’s ‘Secret Weapon’ Be A Game Changer For The Campaign?

"Dec 26, 2015","President Barack Obama has called the fight against human trafficking  one of the great human rights causes of our time  and has pledged the United States  will continue to lead it. If Obama really believed that human trafficking was such an important cause, then why would his State Department be working so hard to hide the truth about these horrific human rights violators? In the weeks leading up to a critical annual U.S. report on human trafficking that publicly shames the world s worst offenders, human rights experts at the State Department concluded that trafficking conditions hadn t improved in Malaysia and Cuba. And in China, they found, things had grown worse.The State Department s senior political staff saw it differently   and they prevailed.A Reuters examination, based on interviews with more than a dozen sources in Washington and foreign capitals, shows that the government office set up to independently grade global efforts to fight human trafficking was repeatedly overruled by senior American diplomats and pressured into inflating assessments of 14 strategically important countries in this year s Trafficking in Persons report.In all, analysts in the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons   or J/TIP, as it s known within the U.S. government   disagreed with U.S. diplomatic bureaus on ratings for 17 countries, the sources said.The analysts, who are specialists in assessing efforts to combat modern slavery   such as the illegal trade in humans for forced labor or prostitution   won only three of those disputes, the worst ratio in the 15-year history of the unit, according to the sources.As a result, not only Malaysia, Cuba and China, but countries such as India, Uzbekistan and Mexico, wound up with better grades than the State Department s human-rights experts wanted to give them, the sources said. (Graphic looking at some of the key decisions here: reut.rs/1gF2Wz5)Of the three disputes J/TIP won, the most prominent was Thailand, which has faced scrutiny over forced labor at sea and the trafficking of Rohingya Muslims through its southern jungles. Diplomats had sought to upgrade it to so-called  Tier 2 Watch List  status. It remains on  Tier 3    the rating for countries with the worst human-trafficking records.The number of rejected recommendations suggests a degree of intervention not previously known by diplomats in a report that can lead to sanctions and is the basis for many countries  anti-trafficking policies. This year, local embassies and other constituencies within the department were able to block some of the toughest grades.State Department officials say the ratings are not politicized.  As is always the case, final decisions are reached only after rigorous analysis and discussion between the TIP office, relevant regional bureaus and senior State Department leaders,  State Department spokesman John Kirby said in response to queries by Reuters.Still, by the time the report was released on July 27, Malaysia and Cuba were both removed from the  Tier 3  blacklist, even though the State Department s own trafficking experts believed neither had made notable improvements, according to the sources.The Malaysian upgrade, which was highly criticized by human rights groups, could smooth the way for an ambitious proposed U.S.-led free-trade deal with the Southeast Asian nation and 11 other countries.Ending Communist-ruled Cuba s 12 years on the report s blacklist came as the two nations reopened embassies on each other s soil following their historic d tente over the past eight months.And for China, the experts  recommendation to downgrade it to the worst ranking, Tier 3, was overruled despite the report s conclusion that Beijing did not undertake increased anti-trafficking efforts.That would have put China alongside the likes of Syria and North Korea, regarded by the United Nations as among the world s worst human right abusers.Typically, J/TIP wins more than half of what officials call  disputes  with diplomatic sections of the State Department, according to people familiar with the process. Certainly we have never seen that kind of an outcome,  said one U.S. official with direct knowledge of the department.ABILITY TO EMBARRASSThe Trafficking in Persons report, which evaluated 188 countries and territories this year, calls itself the world s most comprehensive resource of governmental anti-human trafficking efforts. Rights groups mostly agree.It organizes countries into tiers based on trafficking records: Tier 1 for nations that meet minimum U.S. standards; Tier 2 for those making significant efforts to meet those standards; Tier 2  Watch List  for those that deserve special scrutiny; and Tier 3 for countries that fail to comply with the minimum U.S. standards and are not making significant efforts.While a Tier 3 ranking can trigger sanctions limiting access to aid from the United States, the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, such action is frequently waived.The real power is its ability to embarrass countries into action. Many countries aggressively lobby U.S. embassies to try to avoid sliding into the Tier 3 category. Four straight years on the Tier 2 Watch List triggers an automatic downgrade to Tier 3 unless a country earns a waiver or an upgrade.The leverage has brought some success, including pressuring Switzerland to close loopholes that allowed the prostitution of minors and prompting the Dominican Republic to convict more child trafficking offenders.President Barack Obama has called the fight against human trafficking  one of the great human rights causes of our time  and has pledged the United States  will continue to lead it. But the office set up in 2001 by a congressional mandate to spearhead that effort is increasingly struggling to publish independent assessments of the most diplomatically important countries, the sources said.The rejection of so many recommendations could strengthen calls by some lawmakers to investigate how the report is compiled. After Reuters on July 8 reported on the plans to upgrade Malaysia, 160 members of the U.S. House and 18 U.S. senators wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry urging him to keep Malaysia in Tier 3, based on its trafficking record. They questioned whether the upgrade was politically motivated.Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, has threatened to call for a Senate hearing and an inspector general to investigate if top State Department officials removed Malaysia from the lowest tier for political reasons.The final decision on disputed rankings this year was made in meetings attended by some of the State Department s most powerful diplomats, including Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman and Kerry s Chief of Staff, Jonathan Finer, according to the sources. NO, NO, NO The unprecedented degree of discord over this trafficking report began to become clear after Reuters early last month revealed plans to upgrade Malaysia from the lowest Tier 3 rank to Tier 2 Watch List.The improved ranking came in a year in which Malaysian authorities discovered dozens of suspected mass migrant graves and human rights groups reported continued forced labor in the nation s lucrative palm oil, construction and electronics industries. As recently as April, the U.S. ambassador to Malaysia, Joseph Yun, urged the country to take prosecution of human trafficking violations more seriously.U.S. officials have denied that political considerations influenced Malaysia s rankings. No, no, no,  said Sewall, when asked by reporters last Monday whether Malaysia was upgraded to facilitate trade negotiations. She said the decision was based on how Malaysia was dealing with trafficking.Representative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who authored a 2000 law that led to the creation of J/TIP, said in an interview that the office s authority is being undermined by the president s agenda.  It s so politicized,  he said.If Malaysia had remained on Tier 3, it would have posed a potential barrier to Obama s proposed trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That deal is a crucial part of his pivot to Asia policy. Congress approved legislation in June giving Obama expanded trade negotiating powers but prohibiting deals with Tier 3 countries such as, at that time, Malaysia.Congressional sources and current and former State Department officials said experts in the J/TIP office had recommended keeping Malaysia on Tier 3, highlighting a drop in human-trafficking convictions in the country to three last year from nine in 2013. They said, according to the sources, that some of Malaysia s efforts to end forced labor amounted to promises rather than action.The analysts also clashed over Cuba s record with the State Department s Western Hemisphere Affairs Bureau, whose view took precedence in the final report.Human rights groups and people with knowledge of the negotiations over the rankings said an unearned upgrade for Cuba, especially at a time of intense attention due to the historic diplomatic thaw between Washington and Havana, could undermine the integrity of the report.Cuba had been on the  border line  for an upgrade in recent years, a former State Department official said. And although Cuba ended up with an upgrade, the final report remained highly critical, citing concerns about Cuba s failure to deal with a degree of alleged forced labor in medical missions that Havana sends to developing countries.China was another source of friction. J/TIP s analysts called for downgrading China, the world s second-biggest economy, to Tier 3, criticizing Beijing for failing to follow through on a promise to abolish its  re-education through labor  system and to adequately protect trafficking victims from neighboring countries such as North Korea. The final report put China on Tier 2 Watch List.SHOWING DEFERENCEBut the candor of J/TIP can run afoul of other important diplomatic priorities, particularly in countries beset by instability or corruption where U.S. diplomats are trying to build relationships. That leads every year to sometimes contentious back-and-forth over the rankings with far-flung embassies and regional bureaus   the diplomatic centers of gravity at the State Department. There is supposed to be some deference to the expertise of the office,  said Mark Lagon, J/TIP s ambassador-at-large from 2007 to 2009 and now president of Freedom House, an advocacy group in Washington. If the office is now losing more disputes over rankings than it is winning, that would be  an unfortunate thing,  he said.Most U.S. diplomats are reluctant to openly strike back at critics inside and outside of the administration who accuse them of letting politics trump human rights, the sources said.But privately, some diplomats say that J/TIP staffers should avoid acting like  purists  and keep sight of broader U.S. interests, including maintaining open channels with authoritarian governments to push for reform and forging trade deals that could lift people out of poverty.For entire story: Reuters","IS OBAMA’S RADICAL AGENDA Responsible For State Department’s Misleading Report On Forced Labor, Prostitution And Human Slavery?"
"Dec 26, 2016","Christmas the perfect time to pander to Muslims There is a reason his mother never let him be King. During a recent radio broadcast, Charles, Britain s Prince of Wales, told his listeners that Christians should give thoughts to the prophet Mohammed during this Christmas season.Clip via The Telegraph Normally at Christmas, we think of the Birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,  he said on Radio 4 s  Thoughts for the Day.   I wonder though if this year we might remember how the story of the nativity unfolds, with the fleeing of the holy family to escape violent persecution. The crown prince then likened that event to Mohammed traveling to Medina in search of converts. And we might also remember that when the prophet Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina he was seeking the freedom for himself and his followers to worship. Prince Charles then claimed that all religious groups want the same thing   the ability to live and worship in peace and to allow others to do the same. Whichever religious path we follow, the destination is the same   to value and respect the other person, accepting their right to live out their peaceful response to the love of God,  he said.The Prince of Wales then appeared to go after both president-elect Donald Trump s populist message as well as Great Britain s departure from the European Union based, in part, on the influx of immigrants from Middle Eastern Countries. We are now seeing the rise of many populist groups across the world that are increasingly aggressive towards those who adhere to a minority faith.

"Dec 27, 2016","THOMAS SOWELL:Avoiding the fatal mistake of disregarding the record of the pastAny honest man, looking back on a very long life, must admit   even if only to himself   being a relic of a bygone era. Having lived long enough to have seen both  the greatest generation  that fought World War II and the gratingest generation that we see all around us today makes being a relic of the past more of a boast than an admission.Not everything in the past was admirable. Poet W. H. Auden called the 1930s  a low dishonest decade.  So were the 1960s, which launched many of the trends we are experiencing so painfully today. Some of the fashionable notions of the 1930s reappeared in the 1960s, often using the very same discredited words and producing the same disastrous consequences.The old are not really smarter than the young, in terms of sheer brainpower. It is just that we have already made the kinds of mistakes that the young are about to make, and we have already suffered the consequences that the young are going to suffer if they disregard the record of the past.If you want to understand the fatal dangers facing America today, read The Gathering Storm by Winston Churchill. The book is not about America, the Middle East, or nuclear missiles. But it shows Europe s attitudes and delusions   aimed at peace in the years before the Second World War   which instead ended up bringing on that most terrible war in all of human history.Black adults, during the years when I was growing up in Harlem, had far less education than black adults today   but far more common sense. In an age of artificial intelligence, too many of our schools and colleges are producing artificial stupidity, among both blacks and whites.The first time I traveled across the Atlantic Ocean, as the plane flew into the skies over London I was struck by the thought that, in these skies, a thousand British fighter pilots fought off Hitler s air force and saved both Britain and Western civilization. But how many students today will have any idea of such things, with history being neglected in favor of politically correct rhetoric?You cannot live a long life without having been forced to change your mind many times about people and things   including, in some cases, your whole view of the world. Those who glorify the young today do them a great disservice, when this sends inexperienced young people out into the world cocksure about things on which they have barely scratched the surface.In my first overseas trip, I was struck by blatantly obvious differences in behavior among different groups, such as the Malays and the Chinese in Malaysia   and wondered why scholars who were far more well-traveled than I was seemed not to have noticed such things, and to have resorted to all sorts of esoteric theories to explain why some groups earned higher incomes than others.There are words that were once common but that are seldom heard any more. The phrase  none of your business  is one of these. Today, everything seems to be the government s business or the media s business. And the word  risqu  would be almost impossible to explain to young people, in a world where gross vulgarity is widespread and widely accepted.Back when I taught at UCLA, I was constantly amazed at how little so many students knew. Finally, I could no longer restrain myself from asking a student the question that had long puzzled me:  What were you doing for the last twelve years before you got here? Reading about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, and the widespread retrogressions of Western civilization that followed, was an experience that was sobering, if not crushing. Ancient history in general lets us know how long human beings have been the way they are, and dampens giddy zeal for the latest panaceas, despite how politically correct those panaceas may be.When I was growing up, we were taught the stories of people whose inventions and scientific discoveries had expanded the lives of millions of other people. Today, students are being taught to admire those who complain, denounce, and demand.The first column I ever wrote, 39 years ago, was titled  The Profits of Doom.  This was long before Al Gore made millions of dollars promoting global-warming hysteria. Back in 1970, the prevailing hysteria was the threat of a new ice age   promoted by some of the same environmentalists who are promoting global-warming hysteria today.Read more: National Review",THOMAS SOWELL’S FINAL COLUMN: “…too many of our schools are producing artificial stupidity”
"Dec 27, 2017","AP News  The regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table, the one next to an old box television playing the news on mute.Steven Whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the Frosty Freeze, his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a half-century ago. Coffee is 50 cents a cup, refills 25 cents. The pot sits on the counter, and payment is based on the honor system.People like it that way, he thinks. It reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them, when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here, in God s Country, in this small county isolated in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.Everyone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking. And, recently, news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics   because Elliott County, a blue-collar union stronghold, voted for the Democrat in each and every presidential election for its 147-year existence.Until Donald Trump came along and promised to wind back the clock. He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse. There was a new energy about everybody here,  says Whitt. I still see it. Despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements, he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains, a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of Trump s white working-class base.The frenetic churn of the national news, the ceaseless Twitter taunts, the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen, rarely registering. When they do, Trump doesn t shoulder the blame   because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economic.It means God, guns, patriotism, saying  Merry Christmas  and not Happy Holidays. It means validation of their indignation about a changing nation: gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas. It means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world away.On those counts, they believe Trump has delivered, even if his promised blue-collar renaissance has not yet materialized. He s punching at all the people who let them down for so long   the presidential embodiment of their own discontent. He s already done enough to get my vote again, without a doubt, no question,  Wes Lewis, a retired pipefitter and one of Whitt s regulars, declares as he deals the day s first hand of cards.He thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life, and if they don t, he believes they would have if Democrats and Republicans and the media   all  crooked as a barrel of fishhooks    had gotten out of the way. What Lewis has now that he didn t have before Trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him. One thing I hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner,  says Whitt, 35.  He s a fighter. I think they like the bluntness of it. He plops down at an empty table next to the card game, drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes. Bill, bill, bill,  he reports to his wife, Chesla, who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together. He needs to run home and change of out his Frosty Freeze uniform, the first of several work ensembles he wears each day, and put on his second, a suit and tie. He also owns a local funeral home and he s the county coroner, elected as a Democrat.The Whitts, like many people here, cobble together a living with a couple jobs each   sometimes working 12 or 15 hours a day   because there aren t many options better than minimum wage. There s the school system, and a prison, and that s pretty much it. Outside of town, population 622, roads wind past rolling farms that used to grow tobacco before that industry crumbled too, then up into the hills of Appalachia, with its spectacular natural beauty and grinding poverty that has come to define this region in the American imagination.Whitt slides a medical bill across the table. Looks like this one is the new helmet,  he says, and his wife tears the envelope open and reports the debt: $3,995. They will add it to a growing pile that s already surpassed $40,000 since their son was born nine months ago with a rare condition. His skull was shaped like an egg, the bones fused together in places they shouldn t be. Tommy, their baby boy with big blue eyes, has now outgrown three of the helmets he s been required to wear after surgery so his bones grow back together like they should.They pay $800 a month for insurance. But when they took their baby to a surgeon in Cincinnati, they learned it was out of network. In-network hospitals offered only more invasive surgeries, so they opted to pay out of pocket. At the hospital they were told that if they d been on an insurance program for the poor, it would have all been free.This represents the cracks in America s institutions that drove Whitt, a lifelong Democrat, from supporting President Barack Obama to buying a  Make America Great Again  cap that he still keeps on top of the hutch. Many of their welfare-dependent neighbors, he believes, stay trapped in a cycle of handouts and poverty while hardworking taxpayers like him and his wife are stuck with the tab and can t get ahead. Where s the fairness in that?  he asks.But Whitt doesn t blame Trump for the failure this year to repeal the health care law and replace it with something better. He blames the  brick wall  in Washington, the politicians he sees as blocking everything Trump proposes while  small people  like them in small places like this are left again to languish.A third of people here live in poverty. Just 9 percent of adults have a college degree, but they always made up for that with backbreaking labor that workers traveled dozens of miles to neighboring counties or states to do, and those jobs have gotten harder to find.Many here blame global trade agreements and the  war on coal    environmental regulations designed by Obama s administration to curb carbon emissions   for the decline of mining and manufacturing jobs. When Trump bemoans the  American carnage  of lost factories and lost faith, it feels like he s talking to the people in these Appalachian hills. When he scraps dozens of regulations to the horror of environmentalists and says it means jobs are on the way, they embrace him.Coal has ticked up since Trump took office; mining companies have added 1,200 jobs across the country since his inauguration, more than 180 of them in Kentucky. But industry analysts say that was tied largely to market forces and dismiss Trump s repeated pledges to resuscitate the coal industry as pie in the sky. Coal has been on the decline for many decades for many reasons outside of regulation: far cheaper natural gas, mechanization, thinning Appalachian seams. With the opposition he s had, I think he s pulling the plow pretty good,  offers Wes Lewis from the card table. A few months ago, he says, he saw four brand-new coal rigs going through town.  For the longest time, under Obama, all we saw were trucks being pulled on wreckers, because people turned belly up, they went broke. Lewis says he s heard about friends of friends being called back to work. He s noticed new trucks in people s driveways, too, which he takes as evidence that his neighbors are feeling confident about their futures. These tiny signs stack up to him as proof. Lewis fishes the tag out of the bib of his overalls:  Made in Mexico,  it reads. Trump s bringing them back,  he says.Lewis, a registered Democrat, trusts Trump because he trusts his values. And because of that, he trusts Trump s other promises   so strongly he can t think of anything that would shake that faith in him. If the factories and mines don t come back, he ll blame the opposition. If there isn t a wall on the Mexico border, he says, it won t be because Trump didn t try. If investigators find his campaign colluded with Russians, it s because so many people are so determined to bring him down.Go HERE to read entire story.",WHY THIS Democrat Stronghold County Voted For Trump…And Why They’ll Vote For Him Again: “He’s a fighter…nobody’s gonna push him into a corner” [VIDEO]

"Dec 29, 2015","The drip drip drip of communism in the leftist state of California A new California law scheduled to take effect Friday will allow the police to seize private, legally-owned weapons for up to three weeks without charges or allowing the citizen to contest the seizure.AB1014 was passed last year in the wake of 2014 s Isla Vista shooting, where teenager Elliot Rodger went on a rampage near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, killing six people along with himself.Rodger s parents had reported him to the police prior to the shooting, concerned about his mental health and rants he posted online. But after meeting with Rodger, police decided he wasn t a criminal risk, and consequently didn t search his apartment, where he was stockpiling weapons and ammunition.The new law is intended to stop such a situation from re-occurring. Under the law, a judge has the power to grant a restraining order telling police to seize a person s guns, based solely on accounts from family members or police that the person is poses an imminent danger to others. The restraining order can be granted without the affected person knowing it exists or being allowed time to contest it.Under the law, the factors a judge can consider in granting the restraining order include not only threats of violence, but also prior felony arrests (even without a conviction), evidence of alcohol abuse, and even the simple act of recently purchasing a gun or ammunition.Once granted, police can use the restraining order to confiscate all of a person s guns and ammunition, and the person is also barred from buying or possessing guns and ammo for the duration of the order. A full court hearing must then be heard within three weeks. At that hearing, a judge will be able to extend the restraining order for an entire year. The law gives us a vehicle to cause the person to surrender their weapons, to have a time out, if you will,  Los Angeles Police Department Assistant Chief Michael Moore told Southern California Public Radio.  It allows further examination of the person s mental state. The law expands on California gun laws that are already some of the country s toughest. Police already have the power to seize a person s guns if a licensed therapist informs them that the person s mental state makes them a danger to themselves or others.

I m grateful to have the president s support and appreciate what he has done,  DeSantis said, adding praise for Trump achievements that have pleased conservatives: recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital, signing the tax reform legislation, and appointing conservative judges.DeSantis, a Republican from Ponte Vedra Beach, has been a strong supporter of Trump.In August, he proposed cutting off funding for special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.DeSantis  proposal, which went nowhere, would have stopped money for the investigation 180 days after it becomes law. And it would have prevented Mueller from investigating  matters  that occurred before Trump announced his presidential campaign.Also in August, DeSantis used an appearance at the Palm Beach County Republican Party s annual lobsterfest to advertise his pro-Trump credentials.As he delivered a combination political speech and invocation, the big screens at the front of the room flashed a picture of DeSantis, his wife, their infant daughter, the president and First Lady Melania Trump outside the White House.DeSantis said the president complimented his wife on her appearance.At that Palm Beach County appearance, and at events throughout the state, DeSantis has been laying the groundwork for a 2018 candidacy for the Republican nomination to run for governor.Here s Ron DeSantis blasting the press and our government agencies for giving Barack Obama a free pass over his support for Hezbollah:The Trump effect: DeSantis reflects the shifting type of Republican candidate under Trump: he s a Fox News contributor, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, a supporter of Trump s recent decision to make Jerusalem the home of the U.S. embassy in Israel, and he opposes Special Counsel Bob Mueller s Russia probe (even calling for it to end after just six months).",IT ONLY TOOK ONE TWEET FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP For Billionaires To Open Up Their Wallets For This “FIGHTER!”

Use this as an opportunity for individuals to share what they brought and why it is meaningful to them.If sending holiday cards to campus and community partners, send a non-denominational card or token of your gratitude.Holiday parties and celebrations should not play games with religious and cultural themes. For example,  Dreidel  or  Secret Santa.  If you want to exchange gifts, then refer to it in a general way, such as a practical joke gift exchange or secret gift exchange.D cor selection should be general, not specific to any religion or culture.

"Dec 30, 2016","As usual Milwaukee s outspoken Sheriff David Clarke nails it Chicago has plunged ever further into chaos as gang violence gripped the city for yet another weekend.Under the rule of Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the city has seen some of its worst violence in over two decades. There have been more than 750 shooting deaths in 2016 alone. Over the Christmas weekend, 50 people were shot, and 12 were killed   double the number from last year. Gang violence accounts for most of the killings   nearly 90%   and the perpetrators all had long criminal histories. Most are  targeted attacks  between rival gangs, according to Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. During his press conference on Monday, Johnson said they recovered 45 guns from the streets over the holiday weekend.These guns didn t come from law-abiding Chicagoans who face some of the strictest gun laws in the country, but from hardened criminals who don t obey laws. Johnson knows that stricter gun laws never stops violence:  These gun offenders have repeatedly shown us that they re not going to play by society s rules. So, he s calling for tougher penalties for repeat gun offenders. It s painfully obvious more gun laws will do nothing.It s time Democrat ghetto hellholes like Chicago pay attention to what s happening in their pro-gun controlled cities instead of learning the hard way that criminals don t care what laws are on the books. It s never acceptable to take away the rights of good people to offer the illusion of safety. Crack down on crime, make the punishments severe, and allow law-abiding citizens protect themselves.

"Dec 31, 2015","Just another slap in the face to US citizens. Our government arranges massive payments to hostages taken by the terrorist nation of Iran, as they walk away unscathed .A fund of over $1 billion has been created for the U.S. embassy personnel taken hostage by Iran after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but it is the U.S. taxpayer, not Iran, who will be paying for it.The new fund, known as the  United States Victims of State Sponsors of Terrorism Fund,  was an addition to the omnibus bill put forward by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama Dec. 28. As much as $4.4 million could go to each of the 52 Americans held by Iran, with another $600,000 going to each spouse and child of the victims. The provision authorizes $1.025 billion from the Department of the Treasury to be used to pay for the new fund. Additionally, the legislation includes a 25 percent cap on any attorney s fees, which could lead to as much as $250 million total going to lawyers of the various victims involved.The victims were taken hostage during Iran s Islamic Revolution led by former Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Hundreds of student protesters stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran taking 52 U.S. personnel hostage for 444 days. Several months after the takeover, former President Jimmy Carter authorized Operation Eagle Claw, a rescue attempt by U.S. special operations forces which would later fail. The hostages would eventually be released after a lengthy negotiation process the day of President Ronald Reagan s inauguration in January, 1981. Victims of the embassy attack have been seeking compensation for their captivity for some time, but have been prevented from taking legal action against Iran. The 1981 Algiers Accords, the agreement which secured the release of the hostages, had a provision barring the victims from suing the Iranian government.  Iran is not paying the money, but it s as close as you can get,  says Thomas Lankford, an attorney for one of the victims, speaking to The Washington Post. Lankford refers to a clause in the new law which mandates that any money collected from the BNP Paribas scandal will be used for the new fund and the various 9/11 victim funds. The U.S. levied a fine of $9 billion on the French bank in June 2014 for its evasion of sanctions against countries like Iran, Cuba and North Korea.The staggering amount of compensation being paid to the victims is remarkably higher than the $262,000 suggested by the George W. Bush administration in 2003.  Some may be surprised that a fiscally conservative Republican-controlled Congress would authorize payments of more than $250 million from the U.S. Treasury to private attorneys, even on behalf of victims of terrorism deserving compensation,  writes attorney John Bellinger in the Lawfare blog.

"Dec 31, 2017","As 2017 comes to a close, we d like to acknowledge our gratitude to President Trump, who is truly a gift to America. He came at a time when we needed him most. He came at a time when We The People were watching our freedoms and rights being stripped away by an out-of-control government. He came at a time when educators were teaching our youth that America was the enemy. He came at a time when American citizens were being forced to cede our country to unvetted foreign invaders and illegal aliens in exchange for Democrat Party votes. He came at a time when Democrats, celebrities, and the media were shaming gun owners and Christians for their conservative beliefs, and where daring to say  Merry Christmas  was a borderline punishable offense. He gave up a successful business and time spent with his close-knit family to step into a hornet s nest like no one could ever have imagined, but he did it because he believed in the greatness of America, and in defending that greatness, no matter the personal cost. That s what makes his New Years tweet so perfect!President Trump took time tonight, to wish his supporters,  enemies   the very dishonest Fake News Media  and even his  haters  a  Happy and Healthy  2018. As we say goodbye to an incredibly successful 2017, led by an incredibly successful President, we d like to thank President Trump for the incredible sacrifices he s made on behalf of every American (even those who don t yet understand) to Make America Great Again!President Trump tweeted:  As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America! As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017As a special tribute to President Trump, as he wraps up his unbelievably successful first year, we d like to share this powerful article, written by Evan Sayet. The article brilliantly explains why America loves the  fighter  Donald J. Trump. HE FIGHTSMy Leftist friends (as well as many ardent #NeverTrumpers) constantly ask me if I m not bothered by Donald Trump s lack of decorum. They ask if I don t think his tweets are  beneath the dignity of the office.  Here s my answer:We Right-thinking people have tried dignity. There could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than George W. Bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency. We tried statesmanship. Could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized  collegiality  as John McCain? We tried propriety   has there been a nicer human being ever than Mitt Romney? And the results were always the same.This is because, while we were playing by the rules of dignity, collegiality and propriety, the Left has been, for the past 60 years, engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of Saul Alinsky and the Chicago mob.I don t find anything  dignified,   collegial  or  proper  about Barack Obama s lying about what went down on the streets of Ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the Democratic Party. I don t see anything  dignified  in lying about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks. I don t see anything  statesman-like  in weaponizing the IRS to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent. Yes, Obama was  articulate  and  polished  but in no way was he in the least bit  dignified,   collegial  or  proper. The Left has been engaged in a war against America since the rise of the Children of the  60s. To them, it has been an all-out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale. It has been a war they ve fought with violence, the threat of violence, demagoguery and lies from day one   the violent take-over of the universities   till today.The problem is, through these years, the Left has been the only side fighting this war. While the Left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way, the Right has continued to act with dignity, collegiality, and propriety.With Donald Trump, this all has come to an end. Donald Trump is America s first wartime president in the Culture War.During wartime, things like  dignity  and  collegiality  simply aren t the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors. Ulysses Grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the Army for conduct unbecoming. Had Abraham Lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted Grant, the Democrats might well still be holding their slaves today. Lincoln rightly recognized that  I cannot spare this man. He fights. General George Patton was a vulgar-talking, son-of-a-bitch. In peacetime, this might have seen him stripped of rank. But, had Franklin Roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum, then Hitler and the Socialists would barely be five decades into their thousand-year Reich.Trump is fighting. And what s particularly delicious is that, like Patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated Rommel s, he s shouting,  You magnificent bastards, I read your book!  That is just the icing on the cake, but it s wonderful to see that not only is Trump fighting, he s defeating the Left using their own tactics.That book is Saul Alinsky s Rules for Radicals   a book so essential to the Liberals  war against America that it is and was the playbook for the entire Obama administration and the subject of Hillary Clinton s senior thesis. It is a book of such pure evil, that, just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted, Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer.Trump s tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but, in reality, he is doing exactly what Alinsky suggested his followers do. First, instead of going after  the fake media    and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past 60 years not just wrong, but diametrically opposed to the truth, from the Tet Offensive to Benghazi, to what really happened on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri   Trump has isolated CNN. He made it personal. Then, just as Alinsky suggests, he employs ridicule which Alinsky described as  the most powerful weapon of all. Everyone gets that it s not just CNN   in fact, in a world where Al Sharpton and Rachel Maddow, Paul Krugman and Nicholas Kristof are people of influence and whose  reporting  is in no way significantly different than CNN s   CNN is just a piker.Most importantly, Trump s tweets have put CNN in an untenable and unwinnable position. With Trump s ability to go around them, they cannot simply stand pat. They need to respond. This leaves them with only two choices.They can either  go high  (as Hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth) and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can double-down on their usual tactics and hope to defeat Trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguery.The problem for CNN (et al.) with the former is, if they were to start honestly reporting the news, that would be the end of the Democratic Party they serve. It is nothing but the incessant use of fake news (read: propaganda) that keeps the Left alive. Imagine, for example, if CNN had honestly and accurately reported then-candidate Barack Obama s close ties to foreign terrorists (Rashid Khalidi), domestic terrorists (William Ayers), the mafia (Tony Rezko) or the true evils of his spiritual mentor, Jeremiah Wright s, church.Imagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the Obama administration s weaponizing of the IRS to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the Mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and the Obama administration s cover-up. This makes  going high  a non-starter for CNN. This leaves them no other option but to ratchet up the fake news, conjuring up the next  nothing burger  and devoting 24 hours a day to hysterical rants about how it s  worse than Nixon. This, obviously, is what CNN has chosen to do. The problem is, as they become more and more hysterical, they become more and more obvious. Each new effort at even faker news than before, and faker  outrage  only makes that much more clear to any objective observer that Trump is and always has been right about the fake news media.And, by causing their hysteria, Trump has forced them into numerous, highly embarrassing and discrediting mistakes. Thus, in their desperation, they have lowered their standards even further and run with articles so clearly fake that, even with the liberal (lower case  l ) libel laws protecting the media, they ve had to wholly retract and erase their stories repeatedly.Their flailing at Trump has even seen them cross the line into criminality, with CNN using their vast corporate fortune to hunt down a private citizen for having made fun of them in an Internet meme. This threat to  dox    release of personal information to encourage co-ideologists to visit violence upon him and his family   a political satirist was chilling in that it clearly wasn t meant just for him. If it were, there would have been no reason for CNN to have made their  deal  with him public.Instead, CNN   playing by  Chicago Rules    was sending a message to any and all: dissent will not be tolerated. This heavy-handed and hysterical response to a joke on the Internet has backfired on CNN, giving rise to only more righteous ridicule.So, to my friends on the Left   and the #NeverTrumpers as well   do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be  collegial  and  dignified  and  proper ? Of course, I do. These aren t those times. This is war. And it s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years.So, say anything you want about this president   I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don t care. I can t spare this man. He fights.Townhall published this brilliant article on July 13, 2017.

How about we focus on the 1% of Pakistani s who are Christian that face daily persecution at the hands of Muslims?UPDATE: Tashfeen Malik posted a pledge of allegiance to ISIS before her deadly attack. She used a fake address on her passport.Via ABC:For the visa application, the address she listed in her Pakistani hometown, ABC News discovered today, does not exist. Malik received a her Green Card this summer, U.S. officials said.Tashfeen Malik, the female terrorist involved in the San Bernardino attack should have never been granted an American visa if the Immigration and Nationality Act holds any weight.Malik, who was found to have a Pakistani passport, obtained the K-1 visa in Islamabad, Pakistan. However, American visa laws that are meant to detect potential terror threats trying to infiltrate the country should have blocked the female jihadist from obtaining that visa.As the Center for Immigration Services notes, Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act states that  individuals who appear likely to overstay their temporary visas and try to settle permanently in the United States are not to be issued one. The regulation is meant to detect individuals seeking a visa who do not have permanent families in their home country and whether or not they have enough money to travel back to their home country once their visa is expired.This screening process is meant to expose individuals trying to to get into the country for the purpose of resettling permanently and overstaying their visa, as so many do.Nonetheless, Malik was able to obtain a visa in Islamabad despite the screening process which should have detected the fact that she was a young woman resettling in the US to potentially raise a family with her radical jihadist husband Syed Farook.Malik passed her DHS screening:Under Section 214(b), Malik should have been denied a visa, as there was ample evidence that she would overstay her visa.But, Malik could have obtained her visa the same way the 9/11 hijackers obtained theirs: through the  Visa Express  program.As reported by The Hayride, the Visa Express program allowed 9/11 hijackers Abdulaziz Alomari, Salem al Hamzi, and Khalid al Midhar to obtain their visas in Saudi Arabia without even being interviewed by consular officials at the American consulate.The terrorists simply obtained their visas by sending officials their applications and supporting documents through a designated travel agency.This allowed the three terrorists to go undetected despite red-flags that they were single, young men with not enough funds to return back to their home countries once their visas expired.Likewise, if Malik gained her visa through the  Visa Express  program at the American consulate in Islamabad, it would explain how she was allowed to enter the country despite overwhelming suspicions that she would overstay her visa.The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) admits that there are so many visas given out each year around the world that it is impossible to conduct background checks on every single person.And, we all saw what happened yesterday in San Bernardino.Via: Gateway Pundit",SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED To Step Foot On American Soil: How Female Terrorist Used Fake Info To Get US Visa

Feinstein s tweet came on the same day that President Donald Trump told Israeli and Arab leaders that he plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and move the embassy there. Trump is expected to announce his decision on Wednesday.Moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem would be in line with a law that Congress passed in 1995 requiring  the relocation of the United States embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.  The measure, which also called for the U.S. to recognize the city as the undivided capital of Israel, passed the Senate by an overwhelming 93-5 margin.Among the senators who voted for the initial Jerusalem Embassy Act was one Dianne Feinstein.Feinstein actually played a key role in getting the bill passed by inserting a provision that would allow the president to issue a waiver to delay the embassy move six months at a time, if the president determined it was in the U.S. national security interest.Feinstein s move led 10 additional Democratic members to support the bill, giving it a veto-proof majority.Via: WFB",HYPOCRISY: DEMOCRAT SENATOR Criticizes President Trump For Moving U.S. Embassy To Jerusalem After She Voted To Move U.S. Embassy To Jerusalem

The hypocrisy of the left doesn t stop there Today, President Donald Trump announced that America formally recognizes Jerusalem as Israel s capital city, changing decades of U.S. policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve, not derail, aspirations for regional peace.The critics of Donald Trump attacked his decision. Meanwhile, the truth is, that for decades, some of the most beloved Democrats have used the promise of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel as a way to get votes.In 1999, while campaigning for New York s US Senate seat, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a letter, that she considered Jerusalem to be the  eternal and indivisible capital of Israel  and will be an active advocate   if elected to New York s Senate seat   to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.In a letter that became public Thursday, Mrs. Clinton wrote:  If I am chosen by New Yorkers to be their senator, or in whatever position I find myself in the years to come, you can be sure that I will be an active, committed advocate for a strong and secure Israel, able to live in peace with its neighbors, with the United States Embassy located in its capital, Jerusalem. Hillary s not the only one to promise, that if elected, they would move heaven and earth to make Jerusalem the rightful capital of Israel. As it turns out, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama (twice) also made the same promise. The only problem is, none of them had the courage to do it.Watch:When President @realDonaldTrump announced that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, he fulfilled another campaign promise, in addition to those that go back 25 years . pic.twitter.com/P7M2dEx2qT  Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) December 7, 2017Here s why our courageous president, Donald Trump was right to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel:Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon wrote the best article on Trump s bold decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem that we have seen to date.Not only is President Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and begin the process of moving the U.S. embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency. It is one of the boldest moves any U.S. president has made since the beginning of the Oslo  peace process  in 1993. That process collapsed at Camp David in 2000 when Yasir Arafat rejected President Clinton s offer of a Palestinian state. And the process has been moribund ever since, despite multiple attempts to restart it.That is why the warnings from Trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow. There is no peace process to wreck. The conflict is frozen. And the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in U.S. or Israeli policy but in Palestinian autocracy, corruption, and incitement. Have the former Obama administration officials decrying Trump s announcement read a newspaper lately? From listening to them, you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the Middle East but for Trump. In fact, the region is engulfed in war, terrorism, poverty, and despotism; Israel faces threats in the north and south; its sworn enemy, Iran, is growing in influence and reach; and the delegitimization of the Jewish State proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses. I forget how the Obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring Israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Maybe someone will remind me.One of the reasons the Middle East persists in its decrepit condition is that it has been, for decades, a playground of magical thinking. Whether it is believing that poverty is the cause of terrorism or that the Ayatollah Khamenei is a good-faith partner, whether it is imagining that Assad will go just because we tell him to or that ISIS is akin to a terrorist  JV team,  liberal internationalists have all too eagerly accepted an alternative picture of the Middle East that is much more flattering than the actuality. A similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over Jerusalem. Every Israeli knows Jerusalem was, is, and will remain his capital. Every recent president has agreed with him. And the U.S. consensus has been bipartisan. The last four Democratic platforms have said the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. The Senate voted 90-0 only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city. Were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote? Was it all virtue-signaling, a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of U.S. diplomacy?It is a sign of the disingenuousness of American foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning. President Trump has no background in or admiration for the routines, manners, and norms of the U.S. foreign service, especially that part of it which specializes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid: Jerusalem is Israel s capital, full stop. His transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition. In March 2016, at the AIPAC policy conference, he pledged that  We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.  His remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the pro-Israel community.I wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of U.S. law as  disruptive.  Have they not paid attention to this man? Donald Trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the U.S. capital for decades. In this sense, his Jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm. He is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion. What Trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one. By keeping his campaign promise today, he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the United States could have its cake and eat it too on the question of Israel s capital. And by moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the United States will acknowledge Israel s right to determine its own capital city. That is not something to condemn or fear. It is something to be proud of.",WATCH: 3 PRESIDENTS Before Trump Promised To Move U.S. Embassy To Jerusalem
"Dec 7, 2015","Bombs a-w oh, never mind Things must be going well in the  war on terror,  as the US Air Force just admitted that it is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS after  B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers.  As ZeeNews reports, Air Force chief of staff General Mark Welsh said as America ramps up its military campaign against the Islamist terror group, the Air Force is now  expending munitions faster than we can replenish them. The US Air Force is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq after its pilots fired off over 20,000 missiles and bombs since the US bombing campaign against the terror group began 15 months ago, its chief has said. As ZeeNews reports, B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers. F-15Es are in the fight because they are able to employ a wide range of weapons and do so with great flexibility. We need the funding in place to ensure we re prepared for the long fight,  Welsh said in the statement. This is a critical need,  he said.The bombing campaign has left the US Air Force with what an Air Force official described as munitions depot stocks  below our desired objective. The Air Force has requested additional funding for Hellfire missiles and is developing plans to ramp up weapons production to replenish its stocks more quickly. But replenishing that stock can take  up to four years from time of expenditure to asset resupply,  the official told CNN. The precision today s wars requires demands the right equipment and capability to achieve desired effects. We need to ensure the necessary funding is in place to not only execute today s wars, but also tomorrow s challenges,  the official said. As The Washington Times concludes, Russia has been bombing ISIS positions sporadically while France and Great Britain are now active in the American-led coalition which could relieve some pressure.Much larger potential adversaries like Russia or China most surely are following this development carefully. If the USAF cannot sustain a trickling battle against a poorly armed, medieval enemy, fighting a superpower military is obviously beyond its capability.Via: Zero Hedge","U.S. Air Force Runs Out Of Bombs To Drop On ISIS…Don’t Worry Though, Barry’s Got This"

"Dec 7, 2017","What s more important, protecting the dignity of customers who shop in local liquor stores, or the innocent employees and store owners who come in every day, knowing that the only thing that ensures they will go home alive, is the bullet-proof glass between them and the criminal element who enters their store? Well, according to one Philadelphia councilwoman, it s the dignity of the customers. Philadelphia s Public Health and Human Services Committee passed a bill Monday to ban shop owners from protecting themselves with bulletproof plexiglass.Philadelphia 8th District Councilwoman Cindy Bass, who is behind the bill, said previously that having to see plexiglass represents an  indignity  to her constituents and should, therefore, be banned.  Information LiberationFOX News   Philadelphia is one step closer to getting rid of bulletproof glass in many of its small businesses as part of a larger effort to crack down on loitering, public urination, and potential drug sales   but the potential ban has triggered a backlash from shopkeepers.The city s Public Health and Human Services Committee passed a bill Monday enabling Philadelphia s Department of Licenses and Inspections to regulate the bullet-resistant barricades that stand between customers and cash registers in many neighborhood corner stores, according to FOX29. No establishment required to obtain a Large Establishment license   shall erect or maintain a physical barrier that requires the persons serving the food either to open a window or other aperture or to pass the food through a window or other aperture, in order to hand the food to a customer inside the establishment,  the bill states. It also calls for larger establishments to have bathrooms for customers.Here s a great example of the crime Philadelphia officers deal with every day in a city where the elected officials are more worried about passing laws to protect the dignity of liquor store customers, and not the people who bravely come to work every day to sell goods in dangerous, crime-ridden neighborhoods.

"Dec 8, 2015","What does Obama, the Democrat Party, the state-run media and faux conservatives in Congress all have in common with Hamas? They all want to take down Trump TEL AVIV   Palestinian terrorist organizations did not take kindly to Donald Trump s call for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on. Responding to Trump s proposal, Ismail Radwan, a Hamas leader and spokesman in Gaza, told Breitbart Jerusalem:  We do not estimate that the current U.S. administration, any administration, will implement these racist suggestions. This is a pathetic attempt to attribute terror exclusively to Muslims. Radwan, whose group s charter calls for the murder of Jews and the destruction of Israel, lectured Trump:  Islam is a religion of peace, a religion which opposes bloodshed. Radwan glossed over Hamas  own long and sordid history of bloodshed in the name of Islam, including thousands of terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds of Israelis. Hamas has been responsible for suicide bombings, shootings, and rocket attacks targeting Israeli neighborhoods.Abu al-Ayna al-Ansari, a senior Salafi jihadist in the Gaza Strip, also sounded off to Breitbart Jerusalem on Trump s remarks.Supporters might argue that Trump s shutdown could stop future terrorist attacks. Ansari, however, claimed that, because of leaders like Trump,  the American people are risking more terrorist attacks from our brothers, fighters of the Islamic State. We Muslims have grown used to these types of statements, which prove that the U.S. under any president will continue to be hostile towards Muslims,  added Ansari.The jihadist went on to claim that Trump s sentiments exposed the  truth  about American leaders.  They claim to stand for human rights, while in actuality they carry out the same policy as that of the infidel crusading West, which oppresses the Muslims. Trump should know that a new generation of Muslims has risen, a generation that is capable of handling people like him and countries like the U.S.,  Ansari added.Speaking on ABC s  Good Morning America  on Tuesday, Trump clarified that under his proposal American Muslims can come and go as they please.Trump expressed his hopes that a shutdown  will go quickly,  as soon as  our leaders figure out what the hell is going on. If a person is a Muslim, goes overseas and comes back, they can come back. They re a citizen. That s different,  Trump explained.  But we have to figure things out. Speaking on CNN on Tuesday, Trump warned that the country risks more terrorist attacks if his plan for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration is not implemented. You re going to have many more World Trade Centers if you don t solve it   many, many more and probably beyond the World Trade Center,  Trump told CNN s Chris Cuomo.Trump speculated that there are already terrorists inside the country.  They want our buildings to come down; they want our cities to be crushed.   They are living within our country. And many of them want to come from outside our country. In a statement released to reporters on Monday, Trump cited a poll from the Center for Security Policy showing that segments of the Muslim population hold anti-American views.According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing  25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad  and 51% of those polled  agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah. Trump urged Americans to better understand the ideology of radical Islam before allowing Muslims into the country. Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.

"Dec 8, 2016","43 days and counting Characterizing the military s mission as a fight against  violent extremism,  Obama insisted that soldiers need to rise up against Trump if they feel he is pushing policies that are ill considered.Obama told the troops,  each of us has the universal right to speak your minds and to protest against authority; to live in a society that s open and free; that can criticize our president without retribution. Obama went on to insist that a proper U.S. policy against  violent extremism  is a  long term  policy. So rather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs or deploying more and more troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world,  Obama said,  we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat. And we have to pursue a smart strategy that can be sustained. In the time remaining, let me just suggest what I think should guide this approach. In addressing the war-torn Middle East, Obama insisted that global warming forms a large part of that conflict.  A changing climate is increasing competition for food and water,  which, he claimed, drives the conflict in Syria and other nearby nations.Obama also blamed the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution for  violent extremism  in the United States. Somebody who is trying to kill and willing to be killed is dangerous, particularly when we live in a country where it s very easy for that person to buy a very powerful weapon,  Obama insisted. The president also defended Islam against the charge of extremism:We are fighting terrorists who claim to fight on behalf of Islam. But they do not speak for over a billion Muslims around the world, and they do not speak for American Muslims including many who wear the uniform of the United States of America s military. If we stigmatize good patriotic Muslims, that just feeds the terrorists  narrative. It fuels the same false grievances they they use to motivate people to kill. If we act like this is a war between the United States and Islam, we re not gonna lose more Americans to terrorist attacks, but we ll also lose the sight of the very principles we claim to defend.As to the rise of ISIS, Obama insisted it was not given aide by his actions of pulling out of Iraq in 2011 but was instead given succor by the policies of George W. Bush. By 2011, Iraqis wanted our military presence to end, and they were unwilling to sign a new status of forces agreement to protect our troops from prosecution if they were trying to defend themselves in Iraq,  Obama proclaimed.  In addition, maintaining American troops in Iraq at the time could not have reversed the forces that contributed to ISIL s rise.

It is not going to be able to change the global passport system and get your religion stamped on your passport or your head to establish your faith.What s the Christianity test going to be? Snurfling a hot dog whilst singing  Give me joy in my heart, keep me praising ? After a Muslim couple gunned down 14 residents of San Bernardino, California, Americans looked for strong leadership.

In contrast, Trump IS providing leadership. He knows some of his grand-standing is hot air. But he is articulating a sentiment held by millions and reinforcing himself as a protector of the American people.It s the reason Trump is the Republican front runner. He has spent just $330,000 on broadcasting to Jeb Bush s $42.5 million  which is indicative of how much America is enthralled by this new voice.I hear cries that he is a blithering idiot. I have often been called a deranged fool. But if this were true you could ignore me, ignore us, imaging the two of us shouting naked at the rain.It s because we articulate sentiments repressed by the politically correct consensus that we have a voice.Trump said:  We have places in London so radicalised that police are afraid for their lives. Within moments the Met Police, Prime Minister David Cameron, and the clownish Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, jumped to defend the reputation of the UK and distance themselves from this glaring truth.Yet, at the time of writing, no less than five bobbies on the beat have come forward to confirm that there ARE estates where they will only patrol out of uniform.There is fear among the police AND the public.I work with a team of cameramen in town who text their wives and partners on the hour to confirm they are safe.My family is not keen for me to be in the capital.Some friends will no longer come to London.How do you feel about the security of the city s shopping centres right now, after what happened in Paris?I watch the BBC news, our national broadcaster, ramming home messages of inclusiveness.Today they gave platform to a representative of the Muslim community telling Trump he is an Islamophobe and is not welcome here.But that s not my voice. That is not the voice of a nation. All Brits don t think that way.Being force-fed multi-culturalism brought us to this place. When the only permitted message is acceptance, any views to the contrary result in a label to shame you into silence.Racist! Islamophobe! Nazi!Don t just stick a label it. Be curious. Wonder, how has Trump come to articulate the views of a majority of Republicans across the States?Because I don t buy into the clear divide between extremist Muslims and peaceful ones. I don t see these as two separate entities. It is a sliding scale, a spectrum. From utterly peaceful, to ambivalence to sympathising, to extremist, to a man blowing up buses in Woburn Place.It is the same slippery slope which sees regular mosque attendees from Luton slip off to Syria to join ISIS. And suddenly a tight knit Muslim community knows nothing.Not the local imam, not local families, no one. No one denouncing terrorism. Just a wall of silence. In our country.Hate hidden behind walls we are told to accept and tolerate because we are multi-cultural. Repeat after me. Multi-cultural.History teaches us lessons were refuse to learn.The IRA would not have enjoyed decades of success without many among the Northern Irish Catholic population acting just the same way as the imams and family and friends of extremists in Luton today.We have gone too far and lost control of vast swathes of our country. In part we ARE a radicalised nation and it does nobody any favours to deny the obvious.Trump wants to call a temporary halt to Muslim immigration until America figures out what is going on.Adversaries may be quick to jump on Trump and make him the problem.But look around.

"December 1, 2016","Someone isn t happy with the current possibilities for Secretary of State and is expanding the search. Apparently, there are two new candidates, and they aren t politicians. They aren t former or current military. They aren t everyday Joes. They aren t even Wall Street execs, but they might as well be. They re Big Oil executives.And they aren t just any Big Oil execs. One is Rex Tillerson, the current CEO of ExxonMobil, and the other, Lee Raymond, is the former CEO of ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil is our biggest oil giant.How bloody fantastic is that? Putting Big Oil in charge of the Department of State, arguably the most important cabinet position there is. There could be any number of reasons for this, but Trump s insistence that we should have taken Iraq s oil is one that comes to mind.That s not very likely, though. ExxonMobil is partnered with Rosneft, Russia s state-owned oil company. So ultimately, Putin is in charge of Rosneft and ExxonMobil is Putin s partner. It could be that Trump is trying to tie us more closely to Russia, and that seems far more plausible.It s also entirely possible Trump thinks he might be able to use the Department of State to further his own business interests if he nominates a CEO, although the CEO of an oil company isn t exactly who we d think of if this were the case. Not to mention that he d be putting someone in a position that could potentially be abused for the purpose of furthering their own business interests abroad.Tillerson supports the idea of man-made climate change, and ExxonMobil s position on the Paris climate accord is favorable. However, Tillerson also made more than $25 million last year, so there s another wealthy business insider to build that levee on Trump s swamp higher so it floods, rather than drains.Trump kicked off his victory tour today by saying  America first,  in an Indiana speech. Perhaps he s deluded himself into thinking that expanding his search for a Secretary of State to Big Oil executives is exactly that. However, it doesn t really mesh well with what everyday Americans thought he meant when he said,  America first.  It smacks of serious cronyism.Filling his cabinet with wealthy Wall Street financiers, CEOs, and Washington insiders is the polar opposite of what he campaigned on. There s no telling what an ExxonMobil CEO would do as Secretary of State. There s no telling whether he d even be able to do the job. Trump is either continuing to serve his own ends, curry favor somewhere, or he really is completely clueless.Watch a short report from Rachel Maddow on this below:MSNBC has learned that Donald Trump has expanded his secretary of state search to Exxon executives. https://t.co/QsxL5PG8Bq  Maddow Blog (@MaddowBlog) December 2, 2016Featured image via screen capture from embedded video"," Trump Has 2 New Candidates For Secretary Of State, And They’re Worse Than Everyone Else Combined"

What happened to his promise of siding with workers? pic.twitter.com/rfuQghAGcb  Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) December 10, 2016Someone who wants to keep wages low, and even go as far as replacing human workers shouldn t be Secretary of Labor. Donald Trump said he would side with the working class but there s no evidence backing that up. In fact, so far he s only shown plans for the exact opposite.Many Americans believe there s too many people on welfare, but when they make only eight dollars an hour, how else are they supposed to get by? Meanwhile, more often than not, their CEOs make in an hour what they make in a year. Sadly this is likely to remain unchanged, or get even worse with our new Secretary of Labor.Featured image via screenshot", The Working Class Just Got Screwed By Trump AGAIN (TWEET)

The Fox host is trying to discredit the FBI and we re wondering where the  Blue Lives Matter  crowd is as she tries to take down law enforcement officials. On Saturday night, Pirro said there needs to be a  cleansing  at the FBI and the Department of Justice.Pirro claims that quite a few officials are protecting Hillary Clinton   who does not hold public office   or are destroying Donald Trump, and singled out Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe, FBI official Peter Strzok, former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, former FBI Director James Comey and you guessed it: Special Counsel Robert Mueller   all of whom she says need to be arrested and placed in handcuffs. There have been times in our history where corruption and lawlessness were so pervasive, that examples had to be made,  she shrieked.  This is one of those times. There is a cleansing needed in our FBI and Department of Justice   it needs to be cleansed of individuals who should not just be fired. But who need to be taken out in cuffs,  Pirro declared.Watch:.@JudgeJeanine:  There have been times in our history where corruption and lawlessness were so pervasive, that examples had to be made.

For that, he was sentenced to spend over two years  locked up  in prison for improperly deducting $1.2 million of his personal expenses as business write-offs while living a lavish lifestyle. Mr. Pirro was convicted on all 34 counts.Pirro split with her hubby after he admitted to fathering a child with another woman. He told the press and Pirro failed to give him enough attention. I know! Maybe if he changed his name to Hillary Clinton then he d get all the attention he needs.Pirro s hatred for Hillary Clinton goes way back and it appears to stem from jealousy.Maybe Pirro should heed the advice from Pirro in 2016 when she said,  We cannot have a country run by a president subject to ongoing criminal investigations, potential indictments and never-ending hearings [W]hether she s indicted or even guilty, it doesn t matter.

"December 11, 2016","Well, this came back to bite Allen West on the ass.The former Republican congressman from Florida apparently wants to be part of Donald Trump s cabinet. So he had to scrub and make up a pathetic excuse to explain a very racist post on his Facebook page.In celebration of Trump s choice of former General James Mattis to be Secretary of Defense, West posted a meme of Mattis with the caption,  Fired by Obama to please the Muslims. Hired by Trump to exterminate them. Here s the now-deleted post via Twitter.Once in a while, the mask slips down   and people like Allen West reveal their true thoughts. pic.twitter.com/zaREZ34VdF  Imraan Siddiqi (@imraansiddiqi) December 11, 2016That s right. West literally cheered for Mattis because he expects him to commit genocide against 1.6 billion people who practice Islam.It s despicable and West should be automatically taken out of consideration for any spot on Trump s team.But in an effort to cover his ass, West has the editor-in-chief of his website take responsibility for the post and apologized for it. You know, because West is too cowardly to do it himself. As editor in chief, I must take full responsibility for this, although I was not the one who posted it, and it was posted without my knowledge,  Michele Hickford claimed.  I neither condone nor support the message included in the meme. This meme was not created by me or any of our writers. It was reposted from another source. The image has been removed. Its message was despicable, offensive to many, and a terrible error in judgment by the person who posted it. Furthermore, it does not reflect Col. West s beliefs, principles and values. Clearly, West is still incapable of taking responsibility for things himself, just like Donald Trump. And it s not like there isn t any proof that West hates Muslims and has no problem committing war crimes against them.Four of the men under his command in Iraq beat an Iraqi policeman in an effort to get information. West then threatened to kill the man by firing his pistol near the man s head. This is torture and to make it stop, the man gave meaningless information to his tormentors. West should have faced a court-martial but he was allowed to retire instead will full benefits.So Allen West has no business being put in charge of a government department nor should he be placed in any position of authority in our government at all. His hatred of Muslims disqualifies him and it would be an insult to humanity to appoint him.Featured Image: Wikimedia", Allen West Tries To Hide Desire To Exterminate Muslims So He Can Get Trump Appointment
"December 11, 2017","Ronald Reagan is largely seen as the Messiah of the Republican Party. Despite how long it has been since the man was president, he has always remained the high standard of GOP morality for potential office holders. That is, until now. Reagan is likely rolling over in his grave at the idea of the state of his party with Donald Trump as its standard-bearer, and he s likely doing the same at the prospect of a bigoted accused child molester like Roy Moore (R-AL) being the next GOP Senator from Alabama. Well, now Reagan has another reason to hate Moore: He s clearly in the pocket of Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin just like Donald Trump is.During an interview where he s talking about Americans being the face of  evil  in the world right now, Moore indicates that Putin s harsh and murderous treatment of LGBTQ people in Russia is something he would like to see happen in the United States. Then, he does something most appalling, and goes on to give Putin a message in Russian. Now, no one knows where a bigoted, backwoods buffoon like Roy Moore would learn Russian. After all, he s barely left Alabama, where he has spent the last 40+ years wreacking havoc and just basically cementing Alabama s place as America s bigoted boil on the butt of humanity wherever and whenever he can. However, he managed to learn enough Russian to dog whistle to Putin in that interview. That should disturb us all. Not only is the man being a homophobe, a racist, a misogynist, and more than likely a child molester, he s also a Russian stooge.America, we can do better. We have enough Russian puppets at the highest levels of government. Lord knows we don t need one in the United States Senate.Watch the appalling video below:Please watch this until the end, Roy Moore sides with Putin over Reagan, says that America is the focus of evil in the world, and sends a nice message to Putin in Russian. pic.twitter.com/wFgDkvzEhT  The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) December 10, 2017Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images", Accused Child Molesting Senate Candidate Roy Moore Sides With Putin Over Reagan (VIDEO)
"December 12, 2016","As there is more and more demand by politicians and Electoral College electors for a bipartisan investigation into Russia s involvement in the 2016 election, our President-elect has very conveniently decided to go into hiding.According to Bloomberg, Trump is unable to handle the heat and rising suspicions so he has canceled his first press conference since his undeserved win. Bloomberg said: President-elect Donald Trump is postponing until next month a previously announced news conference to outline how he ll handle his far-flung business operations while in the White House, according to senior Trump transition officials.Trump had planned to make the announcement Dec. 15 but wants more time because he s been occupied with filling out his cabinet and top administration posts, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. He s preparing to reveal his choice for secretary of state as soon as Tuesday, they said. First of all, all you need to do is look at Trump s Twitter history to know that he hasn t been SO swamped with his cabinet appointments to have a press conference   after all, he still has time to insult people on social media and attend his  victory tour  rallies! This is merely the pathetic excuse Trump s advisors are using to prevent Trump from screwing up even more before the Electoral College has to vote on him in a few days. And of course, Trump s team recognizes that having a press conference where Trump is supposed to address his conflicts of interests and business issues is probably not a good idea right now.The cancellation of this contest marks another first for Trump   he s the first President-elect since 1978 who has not held a press conference after winning the election. In fact, Trump hasn t done any press conferences since July   and ironically he invited Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and leak her emails during that press conference. Not suspicious at all, Trump!Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images"," Trump Running Scared, Cancels Press Conference As Russia Investigation Heats Up"
"December 12, 2017","As a Democrat won a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama, social media offered up everyone s opinion because that s what social media does. Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated accused pedophile and serial sexual assaulter Roy Moore in a special election for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed Attorney General. And some Republicans aren t exactly heartbroken about this.Take Meghan McCain   John McCain s daughter. She went right after one of Trump s biggest supporters Steve Bannon as soon as the election results were announced:Suck it, Bannon  Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) December 13, 2017Three simple words. It s amazing what three simple words can say.Steve Bannon spoke at Moore s election night rally, which we assume was supposed to be a night of celebration. Bannon endorsed Moore early on, against Luther Strange, whom Donald Trump himself campaigned for earlier this year. Bannon s support for Moore remained steadfast even in the wake of multiple allegations surfaced against him of sexual assault, harassment and even pedophilia. Bannon even said,  There s a special place in hell  for those who refuse to support Moore.On Dec. 12, the people of Alabama rejected Roy Moore s penchant for pursuing, even assaulting, teenage girls. They rejected his hate and bigotry. They rejected an asshat who has been removed from Alabama s Supreme Court twice for violating federal court orders, thus demonstrating he has no respect for the rule of law. And they sent a message to the Republican Party that this bullshit will no longer be tolerated. If deep-red Alabama can elect a Democrat, then anyone can. And that should have Republicans scared out of their minds.Well, we re going there, along with Meghan McCain and anyone else who believed Moore shouldn t ever hold public office.

"December 13, 2016","The Russians have wanted a puppet in the White House for decades, and now they have one after successfully helping Donald Trump win the election.Last week, the CIA concluded along with over a dozen other intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to get Trump elected. Trump refused to acknowledge that Russia meddled. In fact, he has been desperately defending Russia as his legitimacy is increasingly doubted. Republicans have largely sat on their hands because they don t care if a foreign power rigged our election as long as their candidate wins.But now Russia has a measure of control over the United States that they have never had before and that means Vladimir Putin was able to execute a coup in this nation without firing a single shot   and the unwillingness of Trump and Republicans to do anything about it enraged Keith Olbermann, who tore them to shreds for it. We are at war with Russia,  Olbermann began.  Or perhaps more correctly, we have lost a war with Russia without a battle. We are no longer a sovereign nation, we are no longer a democracy, we are no longer a free people, we are the victims of a bloodless coup. Indeed, if Russia and the GOP are allowed to get away with this coup, nothing stops Republicans from seeking help from foreign powers in any election. Democracy would be dead, and our government would no longer be chosen by the people.Olbermann shamed Republicans for not taking Russia s espionage seriously and wondered  if the Russians hacked the RNC and have kept what they found there to make sure Trump and the Republicans obeyed. That would certainly be an explanation for why Republicans have been defending Russia.And that s why Olbermann called for the immediate appointment of a special prosecutor and called for preventing Trump from taking office until we know what Trump knew and when he knew it. After all, Trump did encourage Russia to continue hacking our political process during the campaign. There is no time for a full review or a measured analysis or recommendations to prevent interference in our future elections. Because permitting Donald Trump to assume the office of president reduces the chance that we will have any future elections. The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum who are beholden to scum   Russian scum. Trump is already stocking his cabinet with pro-Russia officials, including Putin s personal friend Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. And because Trump wants to build a hotel in Moscow and owes Russia for getting him elected, it s likely Trump will be beholden to Putin, which means a weaker NATO and a weaker America as Russia grabs for power around the world with no United States to challenge them. It will not be a peaceful change of power   it will be a usurpation,  Olbermann concluded.  And the usurper has no validity, no credibility and no authority under the Constitution. This is a reality, and this will be the only reality until this country rids itself of Donald John Trump. He is not a president   he is a puppet. Here s the video via YouTube:Donald trump and the Republican Party are ignoring Russia s meddling because they won the election. If the situation were reversed and Hillary Clinton has won with Russia s help there is no denying that Republicans would be crying foul right now. So they need to stop being hypocrites and start standing up for the integrity of our election system. They need to keep Trump from taking office and the best way to do that is to get the Electoral College to vote against him. Our nation s future is at stake.Featured image via screenshot", WATCH: Keith Olbermann RIPS Republicans For Letting Russia Take Over Our Country
"December 13, 2017","In this #METOO moment, many powerful men are being toppled. It spans many industries, from entertainment, to journalism, to politics and beyond. Any man that ever dared to abuse his power to sexually harass, molest, or assault women better brace himself for being rooted out, publicly shamed, and forced into early retirement.Well, unfortunately, the latest bombshell story has actually resulted in the suicide of a lawmaker. Kentucky State Representative Dan Johnson left a suicide note on Facebook and then shot himself on a bridge, according to reports from local authorities. Bullitt County Sheriff Donnie Tinnell reported to local station WDRB that Johnson s body was found after his suicide note from Facebook was reported to the local police. Here is that note:Now, nobody wants to celebrate a suicide. This man should have resigned gracefully and faced his accuser, who was a friend of his daughter s, who says that Johnson molested her while she was passed out drunk in his home. Apparently, Johnson, who referred to himself as some kind of  pope,  routinely engaged in parties with plenty of alcohol with minors. Johnson s home was called the  Pope s House,  and he was the preacher at the Heart of Fire City Church, where the alleged molestation took place.Now, innocent until proven guilty and all of that, but if someone commits suicide, it s likely there could be some merit there. That s a rather extreme measure to take. Further, by all accounts, this guy was no saint. He was heavily pro-gun, opposed any and all abortion rights, and has referred to President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as monkeys on his Facebook page, among other racist messages and images.Again, we re not glad the man is dead. But, it is important for people to remember him for exactly who he was. We grieve for the loss his children, wife, and grandchildren suffered, for nobody deserves such a loss. However, methinks the people of Kentucky are much better off. Sad to say, but true.Featured image via screen capture", KY GOP State Rep.

"December 14, 2016","It s no secret that Russia was behind the election hacks of Donald Trump s political opponents with the express goal of getting Donald Trump elected as well as mobilizing a Kremlin-funded  troll army  to pose as Trump supporters and spread propaganda on his behalf. But it s almost inconceivable that Vladimir Putin actually got his own hands dirty   or is it?Intelligence official now report that Vladimir Putin was not only aware of the attacks on our election (and more specifically, Hillary Clinton), but directly participated in them   and by  participated,  we mean that he orchestrated the entire thing. NBC reports:Two senior officials with direct access to the information say new intelligence shows that Putin personally directed how hacked material from Democrats was leaked and otherwise used. The intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for U.S. allies, the officials said.Putin s objectives were multifaceted, a high-level intelligence source told NBC News. What began as a  vendetta  against Hillary Clinton morphed into an effort to show corruption in American politics and to  split off key American allies by creating the image that [other countries] couldn t depend on the U.S. to be a credible global leader anymore,  the official said.Trump has repeatedly denied not only knowledge of the Russian operation headed by a man he once said he wanted to be his  new best friend,  but denied that they happened at all.So here s where we stand: Donald Trump won the election thanks to the direct interference not only of Russia but of Vladimir Putin himself   after Trump personally asked Russia to hack his enemies on national U.S. television. Since  winning,  he has appointed numerous pro-Russia people who will likely cater to Putin s whims, including one that a Russian political commentator calls  a Christmas gift  from Trump to Russia. Or, of course, he could be called a  thank you gift. Trump once said he could shoot someone in broad daylight and not lose a single supporter. On December 19, we learn whether or not he can hand our country over to the enemy and still manage to assume office.

"December 15, 2016","The double-talk that spews forth from King Cheeto s mouth is astonishing, if for no other reason than so many people believe all of it. He s a liar, he s a hypocrite, he s an autocrat, he s a narcissist. And he promises to continue talking out of both sides of his mouth the same as he did on the campaign trail.And his audiences will continue to eat up every syllable. Why on earth do they do that? Matt Bai, a political columnist at Yahoo! News, boils it down to this one sentence: Trump is a pure opportunist, a pitch-perfect crooner of whatever note resonates.  [emphasis mine]BOOM! There it is, right there. Trump knows exactly what will make people respond favorably to him and he says it. In doing so, he renders anything he said before irrelevant, no matter how contradictory. Look at all his cabinet picks that followed his promise of  draining the swamp  of Washington insiders, elites and cronies. His cabinet is Wall Street bankers. It s establishment politicians. It s members of the very same military leadership he called stupid during his campaign.Trump embodies a type of leader known as the  charismatic leader,  and that s not necessarily a good thing. True, not all charismatic leaders are bad, but they aren t all good either. In Trump s case, this is a very bad thing. In Management Today, columnist Adam Gale says the world that Trump comes from is one where  force of personality is more important than collaboration or cold reasoning. That s all that matters, and why we re suddenly living in a post-fact world. Facts, truths, and reason don t matter if Trump can convince people they don t matter. And he himself admitted to playing his audiences like the violins they re not in The Art of the Deal: I play to people s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That s why a little hyperbole never hurts.  [emphasis mine]Think he won t do that as President? Think again   he s already done it. His loyal subjects still bleat about how amazing he is to have struck a deal with Carrier to keep jobs here in the U.S. They completely ignore the facts that Carrier is still sending jobs to Mexico and is planning to raise prices. They don t seem to care that they re going to automate their Indiana plant, which will destroy some of those jobs Trump supposedly saved so they can keep their costs down. Their parent company s CEO, Greg Hayes, said that outright: We re going to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive. Is it as cheap as moving to Mexico with lower cost labor? No. But we will make that plant competitive just because we ll make the capital investments there. But what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs. In the case of the Carrier deal, Trumpkins  specific fantasy is the idea that Trump can coerce, cajole, and even strongarm companies, one by one, into not only keep jobs here, but also into at least maintaining their current workforce, or adding more jobs. The fantasy is that Trump is going to be able to erase every individual s personal economic distress.That s impossible, but that s what they see through their rose-colored glasses. There are other fantasies, too, like this: My whole life I ve been greedy, greedy, greedy. I ve grabbed all the money I could get. I m so greedy. But now I d like to be greedy for the United States. Washington Post columnist and The Nation publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel hit the nail of that Trumpkin fantasy on the head with this: It was a compelling story: the rapacious mogul turned Robin Hood, setting out to reform the rigged system that made him rich in the name of the common good. She went on to describe how that s an illusion that Trump has created for his faithful subjects, but which his actual policy positions during his campaign should have shattered.This is how Trump s followers can keep right on crowing about Trump s awesomeness and how he s the president we need to be great again. One could even say that they re brainwashed in a very real way (they also seem to be too stupid to see how stupid they are, but that s a different subject).Oh sure, there are a few who are angry. There are a few who have woken up. Former Congressman Joe Walsh, of Illinois, is one such person (and agreeing with that man on anything at all makes us feel like we re in a bizarre alternate reality where night is day, hell is cold, and dragons really do exist, but, well, there it is).Sarah Palin called out his deal with Carrier as crony capitalism.But so many others? They re on social media being as trashy as ever toward the press, toward Democrats, toward anyone who doesn t march exactly to Trump s drumbeat. They re calling any news that doesn t reinforce the golden crown they see on Cheetolini s head  fake news,  and completely ignoring how many campaign promises Trump has already broken. They trust him implicitly because he knows exactly how to sing their tune in perfect time and pitch. Whether he means it is irrelevant.And he ll keep right on playing them. Bai said he ll do it until someone can prove to him that there s a real cost. Bai is right.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images", This One Sentence BEAUTIFULLY Nails Down Exactly What Kind Of ‘Leader’ Trump Will Be

"December 17, 2017","Trump supporters and the so-called president s favorite network are lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI. The White House is in panic-mode after Mueller obtained tens of thousands of transition team emails as part of the Russian probe. Ironically, it will quite possibly be emails that brings Trump down.A lawyer for the Trump transition team is claiming that the emails had been illegally turned over by the General Services Administration because the account owners never received notification of the request and he s claiming that they were  privileged communications. In a letter, Trump s attorney requested that Congress  act immediately to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr defended the special counsel s work in a statement issued just past midnight on Sunday, several hours after claims of   unlawful conduct  by Trump s attorney were made, according to Politico. When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner s consent or appropriate criminal process,  he said.The words that pop out in the statement are  criminal investigation,  the  account owner s consent  and  criminal process. While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump asked Russians to hack Hillary Clinton s emails. After the election, Trump s team is claiming that Mueller obtained the transition teams  emails illegally, even though that s not the truth. We see a pattern here.Team Trump thought Mueller was on a fishing expedition. Turns out, he was actually reeling in the fish. The White House was not aware at the time that he had the emails. Mueller got them through GSA so that team Trump could not selectively leave any out if they were requested.Merry Christmas, Mr. Trump.Photo by Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images.", Mueller Spokesman Just F-cked Up Donald Trump’s Christmas

He called Trump a  narcissist  who will surround himself with sycophants (my word) and convince true believers  to act en masse as if the lies were truth. According to Frum, another consequence of Trump s lies will be to encourage Congress to be reckless.Even more surprisingly, Frum, an old school Republican, admitted that Republicans have lost the popular vote in every single election but one over the last 28 years.

However, he s still used his powers of clemency over 1,000 times. Just a less powerful version: commutations. Including those that were done today, Obama has now commuted the sentences of 1,176 people, including 395 life sentences. Most of the sentences he shortened were federal prison inmates with lengthy, mandatory-minimum drug sentences convicted during the war on drugs that s been happening over the last three decades. Now Obama s completed more acts of clemency since any other president of the US since President Truman.Last year Obama granted 95 pardons and commutations around the same time of year, which at the time was the largest single day use of his clemency power. He s continued this pattern of granting  holiday  pardons, and has received criticism for it, with critics calling it a  broken process.  According to Obama, it s another step forward in upholding our fundamental ideals of justice and fairness.  Besides the Iranian Nuclear Deal, the last four rounds of pardons Obama s granted it s been this time of year.However, there may possibly more pardons coming.

"December 2, 2016","Donald Trump likely caused a diplomatic crisis with China when he decided he would talk to the president of Taiwan on Friday. The move left political observers scratching their heads and wondering how he could have possibly thought this was a good idea. The answer is simple. It s the same reason Trump does everything   he thinks he can get something out of it. In this case, another luxury resort.In 1979, the United States severed all diplomatic ties with Taiwan and adopted a One China stance. Since that time, no president (or president-elect) has spoken with the country s president. As far as China is concerned, Taiwan is part of China. Trump s phone call with Tsai Ying-wen, the president of Taiwan,  is likely to infuriate Beijing which regards the island as a renegade province. So why on earth would Trump do something like this? Go figure, the Trump Organization just happens to be looking at Taiwan as a location for their next luxury resort.The Shangiist, a publication that covers news in China, reported the following in November:The mayor of Taoyuan confirmed rumors on Wednesday that US president-elect Donald Trump was considering constructing a series of luxury hotels and resorts in the northwest Taiwanese city.A representative from the Trump Organization paid a visit to Taoyuan in September, expressing interest in the city s Aerotropolis, a large-scale urban development project aimed at capitalizing on Taoyuan s status as a transport hub for East Asia, Taiwan News reports. With the review process for the Aerotropolis still underway, Taoyuan s mayor referred to the subject of the meeting as mere investment speculation. Other reports indicate that Eric Trump, the president-elect s second son and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, will be coming to Taoyuan later this year to discuss the potential business opportunity.The dire consequences that could come from this simple phone conversation cannot be understated. The only thing less surprising than Trump s stupidity is his willingness to sacrifice the United States for his own selfish gains. His businesses and foreign financial ties have come under scrutiny for the conflicts of interest they create now that Trump is going to be president. He hasn t even been sworn in yet and already he is saying to hell with America for the sake of his own bank account.

The leaked email was written just weeks before Trump s inauguration and it states that sanctions would make it difficult to ease relations with Russia,  which has just thrown the U.S.A. election to him. The New York Times reports:But emails among top transition officials, provided or described to The New York Times, suggest that Mr. Flynn was far from a rogue actor. In fact, the emails, coupled with interviews and court documents filed on Friday, showed that Mr. Flynn was in close touch with other senior members of the Trump transition team both before and after he spoke with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, about American sanctions against Russia.A White House lawyer tried to explain McFarland s email to the The Times by saying that she was referring to the Democrats  portrayal of the election. That doesn t make any sense, by the way.McFarland wrote the email to Thomas P.

He s got a paranoid lunatic for the National Security Council, he s got a white supremacist as his chief strategist, and the list goes on. One of his picks for an ambassadorship is David Friedman for Israel. This isn t just someone who supports the worst of Israel, he also made a bizarre attack on The New York Times over their coverage of Trump s  pussy grabbing  comment by invoking the Holocaust.Seriously, he did that. Back in October, not too long after the Access Hollywood tape came out, Friedman said: While the revelation of Mr. Trump s demeaning comments caught on tape some 11 years ago brought him, as one would expect, widespread negative attention, The New York Times ran with the story with all the journalistic integrity of the worst gossip rag. If only the Times had reported on the Nazi death camps with the same fervor as its failed last-minute attempt to conjure up alleged victims of Donald Trump, imagine how many lives could have been saved. As Peter Beinart wrote in a column for Haaretz, where he published several of Friedman s idiotic comments,  Invoking the murder of six million Jews in an effort to discredit women who accuse a powerful man of sexual assault is wrong. FLAT wrong.There really is no way to describe this as anything other than disgusting and absurd. Beinart also pointed out that the Times coverage of these accusations has nothing whatever to do with how they covered the Holocaust. It also has nothing to do with the times that we live in   the Holocaust was 75 years ago. Press coverage of anything was very different than it is today, in the age of the Internet.Friedman is probably one of the worst people imaginable to nominate for any high-level position in our government.

"December 21, 2016","Conservatives radio host and all-around terrible, horrible, one-of-the-worst-in-the-world person, Ann Coulter, has long been viewed as the unofficial voice of white supremacists for years, but now that Trump is elected she doesn t think she needs to hide it anymore.The Southern Poverty Law Center reports that Coulter, whom they describe as  an infamous far-right attack dog who has spent years attacking the left,  attended a Christmas party hosted by white nationalist anti-immigration group VDARE, which published writing that  focuses on opposing non-white immigration into the United States, but [the site] has also published the writings of anti-Semites. Just to give you an idea who these people are and what they represent, the SPLC collected a few of their more notable lines from their collection of racist propaganda: America was defined   almost explicitly, sometimes very explicitly   as a white nation, for white people, and what that means is that there is virtually no figure, no law, no policy, no event in the history of the old, white America that can survive the transition to the new and non-white version. Whether we will want to call the new updated version  America  at all is another question entirely.    Sam Francis, VDARE.com, July 21, 2003 Jewish activity collectively, throughout history, is best understood as an elaborate and highly successful group competitive strategy directed against neighboring peoples and host societies. The objective has been control of economic resources and political power. One example: overwhelming Jewish support for non-traditional immigration, which has the effect of weakening America s historic white majority.    Kevin MacDonald, VDARE.com, Nov. 14, 2006 What race realists find most infuriating about the liberalism of the last half century is not just that it has lost its instinctive appreciation for the culture and people of the West but actively, viciously attacks them. Whites are doing something no other people have ever done in human history. Our rulers and elites welcome replacement by aliens, they vilify our ancestors and their own, they sacrifice our interests to those of favored minorities, and they treat the entire history of the West as if it were a global plague of rapine and exploitation. This is a disease that is killing us, and we must fight it head on.    Jared Taylor, VDARE.com, July 4, 2008The cast of cartoonish gasbags in this almost terrifyingly surreal mess includes a guy who once claimed that black people are incapable of sustaining any society, someone who wrote a trilogy (wow, a whole trilogy, huh?) of anti-Semitic blood libel, and the writings of a deceased prominent white supremacist who has a terrifying  final  solution to the  race  problem: If whites wanted to do so, they could dictate a solution to the racial problem tomorrow   by curtailing immigration and sealing the border, by imposing adequate fertility controls on nonwhites and encouraging a higher white birth rate, by refusing to be bullied into enduring  multiculturalism,  affirmative action, civil rights laws and policies; and by refusing to submit to cultural dissolution, inter-racial violence and insults, and the guilt that multiracialists inculcate. Naturally, since this matches Coulter s rhetoric almost entirely, you can see why she d want to attend their little Christmas shindig, which was hosted by founder Peter Brimelow. At the event, Coulter gave an interview to VDARE contributor John Derbyshire, who was fired by the National Review after his take on the Trayvon Martin murder:Derbyshire joined VDARE after being fired by the National Review in 2012 for writing a racist screed in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting titled,  The Talk: Nonblack Version.  The article, presented as a talk from a white parent to their child included lines like,  A small cohort of blacks   in my experience, around five percent   is ferociously hostile to whites and will go to great lengths to inconvenience or harm us.  It also included tips like,  If planning a trip to a beach or amusement park at some date, find out whether it is likely to be swamped with blacks on that date.

"December 22, 2017","Many people have raised the alarm regarding the fact that Donald Trump is dangerously close to becoming an autocrat. The thing is, democracies become autocracies right under the people s noses, because they can often look like democracies in the beginning phases. This was explained by Republican David Frum just a couple of months into Donald Trump s presidency, in a piece in The Atlantic called  How to Build an Autocracy. In fact, if you really look critically at what is happening right now   the systematic discrediting of vital institutions such as the free press and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well the direct weaponization of the Department of Justice in order to go after Trump s former political opponent, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and you have the makings of an autocracy. We are more than well on our way. Further, one chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, already has a rogue band of Republicans who are running a parallel investigation to the official Russian collusion investigation, with the explicit intent of undermining and discrediting the idea that Trump could have possibly done anything wrong with the Russians in order to swing the 2016 election in his favor.All of that is just for starters, too. Now, we have Trump making United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley bully and threaten other countries in the United Nations who voted against Trump s decision to change U.S. policy when it comes to recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish State. Well, one expert, who is usually quite measured, has had enough of Trump s autocratic antics: Former CIA Director John O. Brennan. The seasoned spy took to Trump s favorite platform, Twitter, and blasted the decision:Trump Admin threat to retaliate against nations that exercise sovereign right in UN to oppose US position on Jerusalem is beyond outrageous. Shows @realDonaldTrump expects blind loyalty and subservience from everyone qualities usually found in narcissistic, vengeful autocrats.  John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) December 21, 2017Director Brennan is correct, of course. Trump is behaving just like an autocrat, and so many people in the nation are asleep when it comes to this dangerous age, in which the greatest threat to democracy and the very fabric of the republic itself is the American president. Fellow Americans, we know the GOP-led Congress will not be the check on Trump that they are supposed to be. It s time to get out and flip the House and possibly the Senate in 2018, and resist in the meantime, if we want to save our country from devolving into something that looks more like Russia or North Korea than the America we have always know.

"December 23, 2016","If Donald Trump wanted people to think he isn t joined at the hip to Russian president Vladimir Putin, this is a strange way to do it. Apparently not satisfied with his own attacks on Hillary Clinton, Trump has now resorted to citing Putin to somehow add extra venom to his catty remarks about the former Democratic presidential nominee.President-elect Donald Trump agreed with Vladimir Putin s assessment of the Hillary Clinton s loss in the 2016 presidential election in a Friday night tweet.The Russian president said Democrats were  losing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame  and said that the loss  degrades their own dignity,  according to the Washington Post. Outstanding figures in American history from the ranks of the Democratic Party would likely be turning in their graves. Roosevelt certainly would be,  Putin told a group of journalists in Moscow, according to the paper.Putin is celebrating the results of the election going his way, as he has had something of a vendetta against Clinton for years after she opposed him while serving as secretary of state.The double-edged attack comes on the heels of revelations that Putin allegedly directed hackers to go after Clinton, stealing emails from Democratic officials including her campaign chairman John Podesta, later delivering those emails to WikiLeaks who published them for the world to see.Trump has denied that Russia stole the emails, instead arguing that it is unknown who did the hacking. But Trump has actually received intelligence briefings indicating Russian guilt, which he has chosen to ignore in his public statements.The attacks on Clinton also highlight that Trump is still sore about the fact that while he won the election via the Electoral College, he was still the recipient of less raw votes than Clinton. For all time the historical record will show that nearly 3 million more people voted for Clinton over him.Featured image via Flickr", Sore Winner: Trump Attacks Clinton With Putin’s Help

The report follows McCabe s testimony in front of congressional committees this week, as well as mounting criticism from Republicans regarding the Russia probe.So, naturally, Trump attacked McCabe with a lie.

"December 25, 2016","It s still more than three weeks before the incoming Trump administration is set to take office, but one member of his staff has already been forced to resign over an alleged sex scandal.Just two days after being chosen as Trump s Communication Director, Jason Miller changed his mind about the job after it was revealed that he might be a philanderer. His excuse, of course, is that he wants to spend more time with his family.The scandal broke, perhaps ironically and perhaps not at all, because another Trump staffer tweeted hints at an affair. The New York Daily News got screenshots of Trump senior advisor, A.J. Delgado s Twitter account, before the Twitter account was deleted.The first tweet congratulated Miller and then, but then it got weird. Congratulations to the baby-daddy on being named WH Comms Director!  she wrote in one now-deleted tweet. The 2016 version of John Edwards,  she wrote in another, referring to the disgraced ex-Democratic senator who fathered a child with his mistress. It s clear they need to be my top priority right now, and this is not the time to start a new job as demanding as White House communications director,  said Miller, whose wife is expecting their second child.Source: NY Daily NewsHere s the video:To be fair, a good old fashioned sex scandal seems absolutely wholesome compared to some of Trump s behavior. Not only is Trump an admitted adulterer and an accused sex offender, he s blatantly thumbing his nose at the Constitution with his conflicts of interest and with campaign improprieties.This clearly also points to the fact that Trump is not doing his due diligence when it comes to picking his staff. The President Elect hasn t been vetted, which is frightening on its own, but Congress can t do much about that fact. They can, however, put up a real fuss, if they so desire, about skeletons in the closets of Trump s nominees.

"December 25, 2017","Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.", Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump During His Christmas Speech

This is Mama welcoming the presidents to DC,  her great-nephew Abu-El-Hawa told the Washingtonian about the painting.  She was the American dream. For a Muslim and Arab woman immigrant from Palestine to come here on her own and build this business, is a remarkable legacy.

They cannot afford to post the $1,000,000 bond required by the court,  wrote the lawyer.Stein shared her thoughts on Twitter.How odd is it that we must jump through bureaucratic hoops and raise millions of dollars so we can trust our election results? #Recount2016  Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) December 4, 2016According to court documents, Donald Trump s campaign requested that the judge set the bond for the recount at $10 million.Stein has filed for recounts of the presidential election in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Hillary Clinton announced that she would back Stein s recount efforts in all three states, which prompted Trump to lose his mind. He railed against the efforts on Twitter and denounced the bid for recounts as nothing more than a  scam.  Ironically, he made the case for a recount of even more states at the very same time with his own claims of widespread voter fraud.It is unlikely that the recount would successfully change the outcome of the election in the long run, especially since a margin of this size has never before been overcome. However, Trump sure was acting like he was scared to death of a second look. It seems that, at least in Pennsylvania, he is going to get his way. In Wisconsin and Michigan, Trump has not been so lucky. The recounts in both of these states have already begun. But the push for a recount in the Keystone State seems to have come to an end.On Saturday night, the Pennsylvania GOP issued a statement that read, in part: The filing of a discontinuance of the Election Contest by Jill Stein s petitioners tonight is a recognition that their Election Contest was completely without merit, and meant solely for purposes to delay the Electoral College vote in Pennsylvania for President-Elect Trump Candidate Jill Stein s allegations created the false allusion that some unidentified foreign government hacked our state s voting systems when absolutely no such proof existed. We believe that she always knew that she had no such proof. Pennsylvania election officials published the updated vote count on Friday, which showed Trump s lead over his Democratic rival shrinking to 49,000 from 71,000.

"December 30, 2016","As President Obama is threatening and acting out on retaliation for Russia s hack of the United States election, it s becoming evident that the hack was even bigger. According to a report in the Washington Post, the Vermont electric utility was also hacked.While the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a security matter, the discovery underlines the vulnerabilities of the nation s electrical grid. Officials in government and the utility industry regularly monitor the grid because it is highly computerized and any disruptions can have disastrous implications for the country s medical and emergency services.No one is sure at this point why the Russians hacked the small utility, but it s possible that they did it just to show us they can. It could also have been a test, similar to the way credit card thieves start with small charges to test the card.This is also far from out of character for Russia. Earlier in 2016, Russia allegedly hacked the power grid in the Ukraine.The hackers who struck the power centers in Ukraine the first confirmed hack to take down a power grid weren t opportunists who just happened upon the networks and launched an attack to test their abilities; according to new details from an extensive investigation into the hack, they were skilled and stealthy strategists who carefully planned their assault over many months, first doing reconnaissance to study the networks and siphon operator credentials, then launching a synchronized assault in a well-choreographed dance. It was brilliant,  says Robert M. Lee, who assisted in the investigation. Lee is a former cyber warfare operations officer for the US Air Force and is co-founder of Dragos Security, a critical infrastructure security company.  In terms of sophistication, most people always [focus on the] malware [that s used in an attack],  he says.  To me what makes sophistication is logistics and planning and operations and   what s going on during the length of it. And this was highly sophisticated. Source: WiredWhile Lee couldn t say for sure it was Russia, the Ukraine is convinced it was. Nonetheless, Lee said, it was a very well-funded operation and it could have been from a nation-state.As Wired notes, the electrical infrastructure in the Ukraine is more secure than it is overall in the United States. Beyond that, many of our electrical grids don t have backup, which means that it could be hours, days, or even longer before we get power back.Even more frightening, the entire nation could be without power indefinitely if just nine of its 55,000 substations were hit by terrorists or by hackers.A coordinated attack on just nine of the United States  55,000 electric-transmission substations on the right day could cause a blackout from Los Angeles to New York City, according to the study conducted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The study s results have been known for months to select people in federal agencies, Congress and the White House, but were reported publicly for the first time Wednesday. The WSJ did not publish a list of the 30 most critical substations identified by the FERC study.One particularly troubling memo reviewed by the Journal described a scenario in which a highly-coordinated but relatively small scale attack could send the country into a long-term literal dark age.  Destroy nine interconnection substations and a transformer manufacturer and the entire United States grid would be down for at least 18 months, probably longer,  the memo said.Source: TimeOne of Donald Trump s campaign promises has been to improve the infrastructure. Obama has been trying to do that for most of his time in office, but Congress has blocked that. Still, even if Trump does get an infrastructure bill signed, his relationship with Russia is troubling. Will his loyalty be with the United States or is he indebted enough to Russia that he will leave the doors open for them to attack us where we are the most vulnerable? It s a disconcerting question, to say the least, and it s why the hacking of the election, along with Trump s praise of Putin, is a big f*cking deal.UPDATE: The Washington Post has issued a correction. The utility was hacked, but that Vermont utility is not corrected to the grid. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid. Authorities say there is no indication of that so far. The computer at Burlington Electric that was hacked was not attached to the grid,  an editor s note attached to the original article said.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images", Russia Hack Bigger Than We Thought; Electrical Grid Threatened

"December 4, 2016","When Kellogg pulled its advertising from the white nationalist website known as Breitbart, they and their followers decided Kellogg was evil for this and called for a boycott. Breitbart s editor-in-chief, Alexander Marlow, even said: [T]o blacklist Breitbart News in order to placate left-wing totalitarians is a disgraceful act of cowardice. Or it s standing up for the rights and dignity of the people Breitbart regularly targets, but hey, they aren t exactly known for their ability to see reality. It seems, though, that their war against Kellogg is now backfiring. Vanguard, 3M and AARP are leaving now, too.And others pulling their ads from Breitbart include Nest Labs, Earthlink, ModCloth and Allstate. Many companies  ads are placed automatically on websites through third parties, but those that are leaving have taken steps to blacklist Breitbart.In short, Breitbart fucked up. They made two major mistakes: The first was when they decided to become the mouthpiece of white supremacy and nationalism, and the second was when they decided to attack one of their biggest advertisers.Advertisers do not like being associated with hate. It harms their brands.Advertisers also do not like seeing one of their partners attack other advertisers. It makes them wonder when it ll be their turn in the crosshairs.However, Breitbart seems to be too consumed with their hate of everything to the left of extreme white nationalism to understand this. They see Kellogg s decision as  anti-American,  which is absolutely absurd since American businesses have always shifted their interests around for the purpose of protecting their brands.But because the members of the so-called  alt-right  (read: white nationalists) think they re the most put-upon and persecuted demographic that ever existed in the whole entire history of everything, of course Breitbart calls this  anti-American.  It s only nice and patriotic when they re doing this kind of thing.Lee Wilkins, professor of communications at Wayne State University, probably summed up Breitbart s war on Kellog the best by saying that Breitbart was  behaving stupidly. There s a difference between being a conservative site and a white nationalist site.

"December 6, 2016","Donald Trump has been bragging nonstop about the Carrier deal that supposedly kept more than 1,000 jobs in the U.S., but workers at the company are calling him out for being full of it. On Tuesday, the Carrier union s president said point blank that Trump  lied his ass off  when it came to the terms of the deal.United Steelworkers 1999 President Chuck Jones said that when Trump first said that he was going to save those 1,350 at the Indiana plant, he was hopeful. As The Hill explains,  Carrier had originally planned to move the jobs to Mexico, but decided to keep 730 of the jobs in Indiana after receiving $7 million in tax breaks from the state, where Vice President-elect Mike Pence is governor. Jones, giving the billionaire con-man far more credit than he deserves, fully expected that when Trump got up in front of the cameras on Dec. 1, he would explain that 550 of those jobs weren t saved at all. But he got up there,  Jones said,  and, for whatever reason, lied his ass off. Last week, Trump couldn t stop boasting about the deal during his ridiculous celebratory rally. Now they re keeping   actually the number s over 1,100 people,  he said,  which is so great. But Jones says this is utter bullsh*t. Trump and Pence, he explains, were more than a little misleading and some of the jobs they claimed to have saved weren t ever even slated to go to Mexico in the first place.

"December 6, 2017","On Wednesday, Donald Trump took a step no previous president had ever dared to consider. He has declared that the United States now officially recognizes the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and announced plans to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city.The only problem is, the city isn t just holy to the country of Israel.While Trump indicated that he wasn t  taking a position  on any contested land, that s really a misleading statement, since declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in effect gives the city to the Israelis, a position that essentially declares the debate on who all of the land belongs to over.Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator in the peace process, was quick to respond, saying that Trump had  destroyed any possibility of peace  and that he was  pushing this region towards chaos [and] violence. Mustafa Marghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, told Al-Jazeera that: This is not a single act. This US administration that did not speak even once about a two-state solution. This American administration did not say or mention the words  Palestinian state  once. This American administration has failed to exercise any pressure on Israel on the issue of settlements, although Israel has enhanced settlement activities in the occupied territories by no less than 100 percent since President Trump was elected. Many expect to see outrage across the Middle East as news of the decision comes in.The European Union, for their part, insists that their position has not changed, and issued a statement almost immediately declaring that they intended to continue working toward recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of two distinct states   Israel AND Palestine.Just as he does here at home, Trump seems to be uniting people against him, even some that seem to be unlikely pairings. Both the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and King Abdullah II of Jordan warned that ignoring the Palestinian, Muslim, and Christian rights in Jerusalem will only fuel further extremism and undermine the war against terrorism. But the decision does make Trump s evangelical supporters in America happy. Their desire to hasten the end of days has been a constant source of bafflement for those seeking to understand the strange relationship between the Jewish state and evangelicalism. According to Christian traditions, the Jews will all die in the Apocalypse, as will everyone who doesn t share their specific beliefs.No wonder they re mostly Republicans.Watch Trump s announcement here:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images"," Trump Completely SCREWS The Middle East Peace Process, Just Another Wednesday For Him"

If you re dealing with people s livelihoods, you sure as hell ought to know what the numbers are. Jones said that, for some unknown reason, he believed Trump would do the right thing at his Dec. 1 press conference and tell the truth  that 550 jobs weren t saved. But he got up there,  Jones said,  and, for whatever reason, lied his ass off,  Jones said.Not being one to handle criticism well, Trump blew his top when Jones called out his B.S. and took to Twitter to voice his anger.Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers.

"December 8, 2016","If there s one thing Donald Trump has made remarkably clear throughout his campaign for the presidency, it s that low ratings are pathetic. He said it about the debates, about how high or low they are, about how certain networks do better than others if they feature him, etc. etc.Taking all of that into consideration, Trump is really going to hate the fact that he has a lower approval rating than any of his predecessors for the past 27 or so years.According to the Pew Research Center: Trump s rating for the job he has done so far presenting his vision to the public is lower than those other recent presidents received following their elections. The partisan gap in ratings of the job Trump has done so far is wider than it has been for any prospective president dating to the 1988 election. Further: Trump also receives low marks for his initial cabinet choices and other high level appointments. By 51% to 40%, more say they disapprove than approve of the cabinet choices and appointments Trump has made so far. In contrast, majorities approved of the choices made by the past four president-elects. In fact, approval ratings for Trump s cabinet choices are 18 points lower than for the next lowest-rated president-elect. And also this: Alongside negative ratings for the job Trump has done explaining his plans and selecting his cabinet so far, most also hold an overall unfavorable view of the president-elect.

"December 9, 2016","Trump s transition team is certainly doing a good job of keeping things moving along, but that s about the only thing they re doing well. What they re busy doing, while keeping things humming along, is another story entirely. Trump s pick for head of the Environmental Protection Agency is enough to send alarm bells ringing, but then his transition team had to go and make things considerably worse.Trump s team has contacted the Department of Energy with some unusual requests that would worry pretty much anyone. They want to know who had attended the U.N. s climate summits over the last five years. As we all know, there was a major climate change summit in Paris at the end of 2015, and we eventually ended up signing onto the agreement that emerged, much to the dismay of climate deniers who want to derail all the progress we ve made as a global climate leader.Their questionnaire, which has 74 questions (more than many tests, employment exams, etc.), also asked who had attended any meetings on the social cost of carbon, which is what our government uses to determine the costs and benefits of new climate and energy regulations. They also want a list of all publications from employees who are at the 17 national laboratories run by the Dept. of Energy for the last three years. Dan Reicher, a professor at Stanford University, said: They re certainly sending an aggressive signal here with some of these questions and they need to be careful. Yeah well, Trump and his cronies, his lapdogs, and the people who are giving him blow jobs and sucking his balls don t really want to be careful. They want to prove they re on Cheetolini s side. Why? Likely because Trump is a massive climate denier, regardless of what he says now, and because everyone he s choosing to run the agencies in charge of both energy production and environmental protection are avid climate deniers.If you re not a climate denier, good luck keeping your job. Trump and his cabinet picks could undo every environmental regulation we ve implemented in the last, well, who knows? 20 years? 30? The people who oppose that, and the people who are just dying to sleep with King Cheeto, would rather perform fellatio than stick by the truth of climate change.Some employees at the Dept. of Energy feel like this is an  enemies list,  of sorts: When Donald Trump said he wanted to drain the swamp it apparently was just to make room for witch hunts and it s starting here at the DOE and our 17 national labs. Yup. Most likely. Energy and environmental policy are good places to start since not many people really think about those things. Care? Absolutely, but not think about on a daily basis, which is sad considering the fact that we still need this planet to survive, and if it changes faster than we can adapt, we ll all die.But who cares about that, right? Climate change is always happening, and it s not man-made because man can t be so arrogant as to thwart the Almighty Christian God, so trying to save the environment is dumb since businesses need profit and man will either survive or die anyway.Or that s how they sound.Anyway.The Dept. of Energy should be afraid because they might be the start of a government-wide purging of people who don t agree with every single syllable Trump utters, either in front of a mic or on his Twitter account.

"Feb 11, 2017","University trustees, known as the Yale Corporation, voted in favor of the renaming on Friday, reversing a decision last year to keep the name. Keeping the name had been defended as a way to confront rather than paper over the legacy of slavery.The change will go into effect in time for the 2017-2018 academic year. John C. Calhoun s legacy as a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a  positive good  fundamentally conflicts with Yale s mission and values,  President Peter Salovey said in a message sent to the Yale community on Saturday. He said depictions in the college celebrating plantations and the Old South suggest that Calhoun was honored in part because of his support for slavery, not in spite of it.Yale is among a number of colleges that have grappled with how to honor their histories without offending modern sensibilities. Vanderbilt University last year said it would pay $1.2 million to remove the word  Confederate  from a residence hall s facade, while Princeton University said it would keep Woodrow Wilson s name on its school of public and international affairs and a residential college, while increasing discussion of the former president s support of segregation. WSJIf Yale is so concerned about promoting diversity and working to erase any signs of slavery, why not rename the Calhoun College with their most famous black alumni, US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas? The tradition at Yale has been to name colleges after prominent, deceased, alumni, and ones that have contributed somehow to the human race. Morse College, for instance, is named after Samuel Morse, of the eponymous Morse Code.Yale will feel immense pressure to rename Calhoun for a minority figure, but who? Of Yale s deceased minority alumni, no one leaps to mind. Someone suggested Levi Jackson, which I thought was a nice idea, but Jackson isn t well known outside Yale circles, and I doubt any of today s students have any idea who he is.It seems likely Yale might jettison the  being dead  requirement. If that turns out to be the case, how about Clarence Thomas? He is easily Yale s most prominent black alum, even if he wasn t an undergrad.I am joking of course. While I would be proud if this came about, the left would sooner burn Calhoun to the ground than let it be named for a black conservative, only going to show that this isn t about race, it s about power and politics.One other thought: Elihu Yale was apparently a slave trader, among other things.

Video footage has emerged documenting the outrage and desperation of 1,400 American workers as they are informed that their company will be sending their jobs to Mexico.As Mediaite reports:  A cell phone video taken at Carrier Air Conditioner in Indianapolis shows the exact moment that the plant and union workers were told that the company had decided to shift production south of the border.  The best way to stay competitive and protect the business for longterm is to move production from our facility in Indianapolis to Monterrey, Mexico,  says the company representative at the microphone. Let s quiet down,  the company representative says as the American workers of different races and ethnicities begin to shout out after being told that they will soon be out of a job.Although the establishment media seems loath to report it, globalist trade deals and the off-shoring of American jobs have become a central focus of the 2016 race  as earlier this month President Obama s signed what could arguably be one of the impactful trade agreements in modern history, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The Economic Policy Institute has documented that  Between 1993 (before NAFTA took effect) and 2013, the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17.0 billion to $177.2 billion, displacing more than 850,000 U.S. jobs. More than 5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost between 1997 and 2014, and most of those job losses were due to growing trade deficits with countries that have negotiated trade and investment deals with the United States,  the report states.Mexico is a member country of the TPP. The Economic Policy Institute notes,  the United States already has a large and growing trade deficit with the 11 other countries in the proposed TPP, which reached $265.1 billion in 2014. In contrast, the United States had a small trade surplus with Mexico in 1993, before NAFTA took effect. In other words, outsourcing to the TPP countries is a potentially much greater threat than it was under NAFTA with Mexico. Donald Trump has made his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership a focal point of his campaign.Trump said that if he were President,I would call up the head of Ford  I would say,  Congratulations. That s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we re going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction,  and that s it  If it s not me in the position, it s one of these politicians that we re running against  [then] here s what s going to happen. They re not so stupid. They know it s not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say,  You can t do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can t do that to Ford.  And guess what? No problem. They re going to build in Mexico. They re going to take away thousands of jobs. It s very bad for us. So under President Trump, here s what would happen: the head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news  And he ll say,  Please, please, please.  He ll beg for a little while, and I ll say,  No interest.  Then he ll call all sorts of political people, and I ll say,  Sorry, fellas.

Gabriel, the president and founder of ACT for America, travels around the nation delivering a message to everyday Americans about the radical infiltration of Muslim extremists in America. She explains in easy to understand terms how the Muslim Brotherhood has one goal: to sabotage America from within, and to make Islam the dominant religion of the country.Watch Brigitte Gabriel explain the Muslim Brotherhood s plan for the destruction of the United States: The most important page of this document is the last page. Because in the last past, they list 29 Islamic organizations set up  in the United States with the specific goal of sabotaging America from within, and destroying America by our own hands. The MSA is listed as one of the Islam organizations whose goal it is to destroy America. The MSA, or Muslim Student Association has more chapters on American  college campuses than the Republican and Democrat Party combined. Watch here:The tolerance for the funding of terror groups by Americans is about to come to end under President Donald J. Trump. One of the first actions he may take is to designate what many experts have been calling a terror group for years. The Trump administration could soon declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, a move that would greatly restrict the controversial group s global reach and would come despite its insistence that it has peaceful intentions.Trump himself was often critical of President Obama s outreach to the Muslim Brotherhood, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed a bill to call for declaring the Brotherhood a terror organization. In the past, it has been accused of supporting terrorist groups around the world, and several countries, including Muslim nations, have banned them.If the U.S. declares the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, it would make it a criminal act for Americans to fund the group, ban banks from processing money for it, bar people with ties to the group from coming to the United States and make it easier to deport immigrants who have worked with the organization. It is time to call this enemy by its name and speak with clarity and moral authority,  Cruz said in a statement introducing the bill. Watch Brigitte Gabriel destroy this Imam on Judge Jeanine s FOX News show: FOX NewsThe Left doesn t think Trump should designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and here s why:The New York Times editorial board thinks President Trump shouldn t designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization because it could make Trump the enemy of all Muslims.The liberal paper published Thursday an editorial Thursday titled  All of Islam Isn t the Enemy  arguing against the move, which the Trump administration is reportedly considering as a possible option. CIA Director Mike Pompeo has said he supports designating the group, which is open about its goal of creating a state ruled by Islamic law, as a terrorist organization. Is President Trump trying to make enemies of the entire Muslim world?

The views expressed herein are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of Clarion Project. Ryan Mauro previously interviewed Anila Ali for Clarion Project.1. Clarion Project: Since Trump s election many Muslim groups are feeling scared that he will implement repressive policies targeted at the Muslim community. How do you feel about such fears?Anila Ali: There is a real fear in the community that a Trump presidency will mean restrictions on Muslims. There is talk of internment camps and it was in registry and that is generating a lot of misconceptions and fears. There is also a concern that Mosques and citizens will be monitored as well.Personally, I have faith in the constitution of the United States of America and I feel majority of America knows and understands that you cannot make generalized statements about all Muslims and paint all Muslims with the same brush stroke.But we have also realize that it is time that Muslims in America step up their game and get more involved in making sure that the neighbors understand who they are and that they are peace-loving patriotic Americans.For it is mostly the fear of the unknown that spreads misconceptions.2. Clarion: What should public figures be doing to calm inter-communal relations?Ali: Public figures, especially the ones in the majority party, have a responsibility to represent all Americans. Their words can help alleviate fears about Muslims and stop the Muslims from getting marginalized. Show of support unity with all unities that maybe feeling slightly marginalized, will help them from further isolation.The level of hateful rhetoric that I have heard in the past one month has been the worst since 911. It seems people have a newfound courage to tell  Muslims to leave the country,   pack up and leave the country  etc. Anti-Muslim sentiment is rampant and most people are not able to distinguish between a radical and a moderate.There is a general perception that all Muslims condone violence and that all Muslims want sharia law in America. There is also a very toxic perception that Muslims like myself who are any patriotic, modern and progressive are lying as mandated in the Quran to convert people, the concept being taqqiya. This notion must be dispelled because the majority of Muslims don t even know what this concept is. Muslims who have come from South Asia have no idea of this Arabic concept because it is part of the Wahhabi Salafist ideology and Muslims like me, majority coming from South Asia, have never even heard of it.These misconceptions in the mainstream community must be countered and dispelled.3. Clarion: What do you think the impact of designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization would be if it passed?Ali: If Arab countries can ban Muslim brotherhood why can t we? Any organization that has terrorist ties should be banned in the US. Any organization that condone the killing of an innocent, or promote so insights hatred for non-Muslims should be banned.4. Clarion: What organizations or activists would you recommend as standing up for the rights of the community and are unaffiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood or related organizations?Ali: Of course I would promote my own organization American Muslim women s empowerment Council, formed to counter extremism which gives women a voice, promotes the real Islam, gives women equality and completely condemns all shapes and forms of terrorism and hatred.Whoever wants to follow sharia law should migrate to a Muslim country like Saudi Arabia.For entire interview, go to the Clarion Project",MUSLIM DEMOCRAT WOMAN Is Asked How She Feels About Trump’s Presidency: “If Arab countries can ban Muslim Brotherhood why can’t we?”

That will determine whether it will meet for brief activity during the recess, which could close that opportunity.Here s the scenario in which President Obama may be able to appoint a temporary Supreme Court Justice: The Constitution not only assigns to the president the task of making nominations to the Supreme Court, setting off Senate review that may or may not result in approval, but it also gives the Chief Executive the opportunity to fill a vacancy on the Court temporarily, bypassing the Senate initially, if a nominee languishes in the Senate without final action.Within a few hours after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, it became abundantly clear that, first, President Obama will choose a possible successor and try to get the Senate to go along, and, second, the GOP leadership of the Senate say they will try to block any such nominee from final approval.If that does result in an impasse, President Obama may ponder the possibility of putting on the Court a new Justice of his choosing, to serve temporarily. The problem, though, is that less than two years ago, the Supreme Court severely narrowed the flexibility of such temporary appointment power, and strengthened the Senate s capacity to frustrate such a presidential maneuver.It is true that one of the Justices regarded as a giant on the Court s history, William J. Brennan, Jr., actually began his lengthy career with just such a short-term appointment. The chances of that happening again today seem to have diminished markedly.The presidential authority at issue in this possible scenario exists, according to Article II, when the Senate has gone into recess and the vacancy a president seeks to fill remains. Such an appointment requires no action at all by the Senate, but the appointee can only serve until the end of the following Senate session. The president (if still in office) can then try again during a new Senate session, by making a new nomination, and that must be reviewed by the Senate.The Supreme Court had never clarified that power until its decision in June 2014 in National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning.The decision was something of a compromise. The Court expanded the concept of when the Senate would be in recess so that the president could make a temporary appointment, but it also gave the Senate more control over when it does recess and how long the recesses last. The gesture toward the Senate s choices was probably the more important result.Here, specifically, is what the Court decided:First, on the president s side, the Court ruled that the recess appointment power applies when the Senate leaves town for a break in the middle of an annual sitting, or a break at the end of each annual session.Second, also on the president s side, the decision declared that the president during a recess can fill a vacancy even if the opening occurred well before the recess began.Third, on the Senate s side, the ruling made clear that it has to last more than three days, without saying how much more time must pass without the Senate out of town and doing nothing.Fourth, strongly on the Senate s side, the decision left it largely up to the Senate to decide when it does take a recess, allowing it to avoid the formality of a recess by taking some legislative action, however minor or inconsequential and however few senators actually take part in some action.Suppose President Obama goes ahead with a nomination to the open seat on the Court, and suppose that the Republican-controlled Senate chooses not to allow that nominee. The GOP has enough seats in the Senate to control that scenario.Suppose, then, that the Senate goes into recess to allow its members who are running for reelection to spend some more time campaigning back home.Could President Obama make a nominee during that recess? Only if the Senate is taking a recess lasting longer than three days, and does not come in from time to time during that recess to take some minimal legislative action. Both of those circumstances would be entirely within the Senate s authority.In that circumstance, a recess appointment to the Court would not be within the terms of the Constitution, as spelled out in Article II.Read more: scotusblog",HOW OBAMA Could Temporarily Fill The Vacancy Left By Justice Scalia With A RADICAL LEFTIST Judge

"Feb 15, 2016","Here s the brutal truth on the socialist who wanted to be your next president and take your hard earned money:Sanders spent most of his life as an angry radical and agitator who never accomplished much of anything. And yet now he thinks he deserves the power to run your life and your finances    We will raise taxes;  he confirmed Monday,  yes, we will. One of his first jobs was registering people for food stamps, and it was all downhill from there.Sanders took his first bride to live in a maple sugar shack with a dirt floor, and she soon left him. Penniless, he went on unemployment. Then he had a child out of wedlock. Desperate, he tried carpentry but could barely sink a nail.  He was a shi**y carpenter,  a friend told Politico Magazine.  His carpentry was not going to support him, and didn t. Then he tried his hand freelancing for leftist rags, writing about  masturbation and rape  and other crudities for $50 a story. He drove around in a rusted-out, Bondo-covered VW bug with no working windshield wipers. Friends said he was  always poor  and his  electricity was turned off a lot.  They described him as a slob who kept a messy apartment   and this is what his friends had to say about him.The only thing he was good at was talking   non-stop   about socialism and how the rich were ripping everybody off.  The whole quality of life in America is based on greed,  the bitter layabout said.  I believe in the redistribution of wealth in this nation. So he tried politics, starting his own socialist party. Four times he ran for Vermont public office, and four times he lost   badly. He never attracted more than single-digit support   even in the People s Republic of Vermont. In his 1971 bid for U.S. Senate, the local press said the 30-year-old  Sanders describes himself as a carpenter who has worked with  disturbed children.    In other words, a real winner.He finally wormed his way into the Senate in 2006, where he still ranks as one of the poorest members of Congress. Save for a municipal pension, Sanders lists no assets in his name. All the assets provided in his financial disclosure form are his second wife s. He does, however, have as much as $65,000 in credit-card debt.Sure, Sanders may not be a hypocrite, but this is nothing to brag about. His worthless background contrasts sharply with the successful careers of other  outsiders  in the race for the White House, including a billionaire developer, a world-renowned neurosurgeon and a Fortune 500 CEO.The choice in this election is shaping up to be a very clear one. It will likely boil down to a battle between those who create and produce wealth, and those who take it and redistribute it.Via: IBD",THE BRUTAL TRUTH About The Mooching Bum Who Wanted To Be Your Next President…And Tax You To Death

Nike strongly opposes discrimination of any kind and has a long history of supporting and standing up for the rights of the LGBT community. Pacquiao, 37, made the incendiary comments in a television interview that ran Monday in his native Philippines. He s currently a member of the House of Representatives and is running for the country s senate.Pacquiao didn t immediately back down hours after the interview aired. Pacquiao said on his Facebook page he was  just telling the truth of what the Bible says. But as the furor grew, Pacquiao posted an apology of sorts on Facebook on Tuesday. I m sorry for hurting people by comparing homosexuals to animals,  Pacquiao wrote.  Please forgive me for those I ve hurt. I still stand on my belief that I m against same sex marriage because of what the Bible says, but I m not condemning LGBT. I love you all with the love of the Lord.

While we re on the topic of Obama pretending to care about the black community, let s talk about how black unemployment has skyrocketed under this fraud Race hustlers Civil rights activists met at the White House on Thursday with President Barack Obama, though a leader from Black Lives Matter, who was listed as an expected attendee, blasted the White House for organizing a photo-op without addressing real problems for minority communities. I could not, with any integrity, participate in such a sham that would only serve to legitimize the false narrative that the government is working to end police brutality and the institutional racism that fuels it,  wrote Aislinn Pulley, a leader of Black Lives Matter Chicago who the White House said on Wednesday would be at the meeting.Other attendees included Deshaunya Ware, a student leader of the University of Missouri protest group Concerned Student 1950; Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network; NAACP President Cornell Brooks; and National Urban League leader Marc Morial.In an op-ed on Truthout, Pulley said she  respectfully declined  the White House s invitation to attend the panel, which was organized as part of the administration s marking of Black History Month. I was under the impression that a meeting was being organized to facilitate a genuine exchange on the matters facing millions of Black and Brown people in the United States. Instead, what was arranged was basically a photo opportunity and a 90-second sound bite for the president,  Pulley wrote.Obama didn t address the absence when he spoke to reporters after the meeting, instead saying he was  encouraged by the degree of focus and seriousness and constructiveness that exists not only with existing civil rights organizations but with this new generation. They are some serious young people. I told them they are much better organizers than I was when I was their age. I am confident they will take America to new heights,  he said.Later Thursday, a senior administration official said Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and members of the Obama administration had a  productive dialogue with civil rights leaders about a range of important issues like the criminal justice system, education, the economy and building trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We will continue to engage with the many organizations and individuals who chose to participate in this meeting in ongoing discussions about how to strengthen our communities and move our country forward,  the official said.Speaking in the White House driveway after meeting with Obama, Sharpton said the group discussed the ongoing fight over naming a replacement for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. He said any GOP-led effort in the Senate to scuttle a presidential Supreme Court nominee would reflect a  civil rights violation. To act as if the President is anything less than the President of the United States until January 20, 2017. He cannot be minimized, marginalized or disregarded without doing the same to the American people,  Sharpton said.Obama has defended the groups that sprung from high-profile incidents of police killings of unarmed black men. He said in October those communities  grievances must be taken seriously, and pushed back on the notion that organizations like Black Lives Matter are anti-police. I think everybody understands all lives matter. I think the reason that the organizers used the phrase  Black Lives Matter  was not because they were suggesting nobody else s lives matter,  Obama said at an event in October. Rather, what they were suggesting was there is a specific problem that s happening in the African-American community that s not happening in other communities   and that is a legitimate issue that we ve got to address,  he said.

"Feb 26, 2016","How very progressive Not since the Civil Rights movement of the 60 s has America seen such a racial divide. Of course, we all know who s behind the manufactured race war in America. Barack Obama is working in unison with race agitators and Hollywood idiots like Harvey Weinstein who are willing to suffer the consequences of being humiliated by a racist comedian in front of millions, if it means they are absolved of the sins of not hiring enough black people.The co-chief of The Weinstein Co. acknowledges that the Academy has a poor track record when it comes to films about people of color   including his own   but he feels the blame belongs on studios and distributors, not on  people who ve worked so hard all their lives and prize that Academy card and have reached that zenith and then go on to retirement. I just can imagine Chris Rock s opening remarks,  Harvey Weinstein, the co-chief of The Weinstein Co., says as we sit down to record an episode of the  Awards Chatter  podcast days ahead of Sunday s Rock-hosted 88th Academy Awards.  If anybody s [planning on] boycotting the Oscars, don t, because Chris Rock is gonna annihilate every one of us [leaders of Hollywood studios/distribution companies] in the first 20 minutes of the show, and it will be well worth watching. It will be an Oscars to remember. This year, for the first time since 2008 and one of the few times in the last 25 years, none of Weinstein s films are nominated for best picture   Carol and The Hateful Eight came up short   but he s still going to the show, hoping for a best original score win for Hateful composer Ennio Morricone, among others associated with Weinstein Co. films, as well as a best actor win for  my buddy Leo [DiCaprio]  for The Revenant. That film, like the last two best picture Oscar winners 12 Years a Slave and Birdman, was guided to fruition by New Regency president/CEO Brad Weston, who used to be co-president of The Weinstein Co. s Dimension Films division.Here s an example of Chris Rock on one of his racist rants:Weinstein says he understands, from experience, the frustrations of the people calling for a boycott of the Oscars over the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, and feels they have made a difference   but he does not support their ultimate objective. It s that voice, actually, that gets people motivated,  he says,  because you don t want the boycott. That s how people use their personal power to force change. So I look at that and go,  Great,  because everybody s thinking about that now. I thought about it a couple of years ago because it had bugged me over the years that the films that I did about ethnic diversity never got anything. So I said,  I m gonna stack the deck for myself: I m gonna put out The Butler, Mandela and Fruitvale Station in the same year,  okay? We got one nomination   for U2   out of three movies.  Was race the driving consideration?  I have no idea,  he says,  but it has to make you think.  He continues,  And then, that year, there was 12 Years a Slave, and I said,  What is it, only one?'

I had a lengthy phone conversation with him last year and after I hung up the phone, I had the same kind of feeling I had after meeting Andrew Breitbart. Like Andrew Breitbart, Sabo s not fighting a conventional war against the left, he s studied them, he knows the dirty tactics they use to win and he s determined to beat them at their own game, even if it means shocking a few Americans along the way. Sabo never got to meet Andrew Breitbart, but always wanted to, as he recalls here:Now a thing about me was I d spent a good three years trying to get sober. In that time I did everything I could to stay the hell away from politics. It was the most peaceful three years of my life. Unfortunately during those three years guys like Glenn Beck and Andrew Breitbart were really picking up steam. So, because of my absence from the political scene I didn t really know much about them. And what little I did know about Glenn Beck I didn t really like. I remember friends would try turning me on to him but I wasn t into his delivery, too loud, too passionate. Not my deal. Sadly Andrew passed away about the time I decided to get back into the political fray. I never had the privilege to meet him. Everyone says we d of really gotten along. I did however get to meet his crew and they were all stand up people.Glenn Beck interviewed Sabo in 2015 when he was still keeping his face hidden from the public:  One of Sabo s most popular pieces of work was his badass representation of Ted Cruz who he wholeheartedly supported for President.During the campaign, Sabo came after Hillary and Bernie Sanders pretty hard. He focused on plastering his hard-hitting posters in areas where fundraisers or events for Bernie or Hillary were taking place. Sabo wanted to make sure the American public saw Hillary as he saw Hillary:It took him a while to come around to Donald Trump, but eventually he did.Sabo s controversial artwork can be found on posters, t-shirts and bumper stickers at his online store: unsavoryagents.com Here s a video of Sabo replacing a sign in a park bench in LA with his own unique printed message.

So vote for the wife of a rapist, who laughs about getting child rapists off with plea bargains. It s been 16 long years without a Clinton in the White House  let s make America Sleazy again!It s time to make history with the first female President because our first  Historic black President  worked out so well In a newly unearthed audio interview Hillary Clinton reveals how she managed to get a plea bargain for a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl   and shockingly laughs as she indicated she knew he may have been guilty.During the course of the conversation which dates from the early 1980s, Clinton, then 27, outlines how she used a mistake by the prosecution to get 41-year-old Thomas Alfred Taylor to walk free.Indeed, so cavalier is her attitude to securing the freedom of a man suspected of raping a child that the shocking and candid interview may tarnish her role as an advocate for women and children in the United States.The recordings which date from 1983-1987 were discovered by the Washington Free Beacon and are of Clinton recalling her role in the most important criminal case of her career.Who knew Killary had such a strong southern accent?This is not the first time that the trial has been written about.In 2008 at the height of her primary battle with Barack Obama, a Newsday story focused on Clinton s deeply controversial strategy of attacking the credibility of the girl. Rodham, records show, questioned the sixth grader s honesty and claimed she had made false accusations in the past. She implied that the girl often fantasized and sought out  older men  like Taylor, according to a July 1975 affidavit signed  Hillary D. Rodham   in compact cursive,  wrote Newsday.The girl was a family friend and Clinton has acknowledged in her past 2003 memoir, Living History, the difficulties the case provided her having just moved to Fayetteville. to run the University of Arkansas  new legal aid clinic. This guy was accused of raping a 12-year-old. Course he claimed that he didn t, and all this stuff,  says Clinton.However, what is most shocking is the breezy manner in which she discusses her clients crime and the offhand way in which she questions his innocence. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed   which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,  she says with a laugh.Indeed, Clinton laughs during several different parts of the interview   especially when she discusses the forensic lab destroying key evidence   which led to Taylor getting away with the crime.But, Ronald Rotunda, a professor of legal ethics at Chapman University, told the Washington Free Beacon.  We don t have to believe the client is innocent our job is to represent the client in the best way we can within the bounds of the law. However, he did raise the possibility that Clinton may have breached the attorney-client privilege by discussing the case so openly. You can t do that,  he said.  Unless the client says:  You re free to tell people that you really think I m a scumbag, and the only reason I got a lighter sentence is because you re a really clever lawyer.

"Feb 3, 2017","***UPDATE to story below***In a blow to every mainstream media news outlet (and likely hurting a lot of feelings), President Donald Trump s ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries will take effect in Boston on Sunday after a federal judge refused to extend a temporary ruling blocking its enforcement.As Bloomberg reports, the decision by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton on Friday dealt a setback to rights advocates who argued that blocking people from seven nations in the Middle East was unconstitutional. Gorton was weighing whether to extend a seven-day order blocking parts of Trump s Executive Order.The case, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of several affected immigrants, is one of several that followed Trump s Jan 27 order, which roiled global travel by barring entry to the U.S. of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Individuals, organizations, politicians and some states called it unconstitutional religious discrimination against Muslims.As GMA News Onine reports, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton on Friday asked Matthew Segal, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) representing the plaintiffs in the Boston case. If your honor s question is,  Does the word  Muslim  make a profound presence in this executive order?,  my answer is that it doesn t,  But the president described what he was going to do as a Muslim ban and then he proceeded to carry it out. Am I to take the words of an executive at any point before or after election as a part of that executive order? Judge Gorton on Friday asked U.S. Justice Department lawyer Joshua Press how the seven countries had been selected.Press responded that the list had come from a law passed in 2015 and amended early last year requiring that citizens of the seven countries apply for visas to enter the United States,  out of concern about the refugees that were coming, mainly from Syria at that time and terrorist events that were occurring in Europe.  As we noted previously, only 12.5% of the world s Muslims live in the seven countries on Trump s immigration ban list Which left the judge to decide (as the full docket explains here), The language in Section 5 of the EO is neutral with respect to religion, The provisions of Section 5, however, could be invoked to give preferred refugee status to a Muslim individual in a country that is predominately Christian. Nothing in Section 5 compels a finding that Christians are preferred to any other group. The order provides a reasonably conceivable state of facts (which concerns national security and) that could provide a rational basis for the classification,  he wrote.  Accordingly, this Court declines to encroach upon the  delicate policy judgment  inherent in immigration decisions. ORDERFor the forgoing reasons, the Court declines to impose any injunctive relief and will not renew the temporary restraining order that was entered on January 29, 2017 (Docket No. 6). Full Order at Zero HedgeUPDATE:Two federal judges across the country from each other issued two separate and equally different decisions late Friday   one refusing to extend an injunction against President Donald Trump s U.S. travel suspension and one blocking its effect nationwide.First, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, in Boston, said in a preliminary 21-page ruling that he would not extend a seven-day restraining order that has prevented the travel restrictions from being implemented this week.A short time later on Friday, though, U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, in Seattle, upheld a challenge to Trump s order from the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota and issued another temporary national restraining order. The state has met its burden in demonstrating immediate and irreparable injury,  Robart saidThe Boston ruling was a key victory for the Trump administration on the matter, but the win didn t last very long. The subsequent Seattle decision, meanwhile, represented the most significant legal setback yet in the battle over the president s directive   as it blocks the order with a new injunction.

"Feb 4, 2016","Of course anyone on Obama s  Team Fundamental Transformation of America  is exempt from any of the  consequences the rest of America would have to face for the same unlawful actions To meet the Obama administration s goal of  implementing a robust diversity strategy  at the Department of Defense (DOD), the agency s director of diversity violated government rules by distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to controversial leftist groups. Adding insult to injury, a  consulting  firm gets nearly half a million dollars from the DOD to help distribute the money to groups even those that don t qualify that support the Pentagon s  diversity strategy and program objectives. Among the recipients is the notorious open borders group League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Minority Access Inc., a Maryland-based nonprofit committed to decreasing disparities and reducing incidences of environmental injustices, and the renowned National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Others include the Society of American Indian Government Employees and the Asian American Government Executive Network. In all, the Pentagon s Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity (ODME) gave these and other groups north of $300,000, according to a DOD Inspector General report released this month. These are considered  affinity  groups involved with networking or professional associations that are often race, ethnic background or gender based, according to the report.The high-ranking official who violated DOD and government rules by doling out the cash to unqualified  non-federal entities  (NFE) is Clarence Johnson, the DOD s Director of Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity. In 2010 Johnson, a veteran Pentagon official, was assigned to assist the Army in implementing a robust diversity strategy. The position came with a hefty budget to support diversity outreach functions and Johnson launched a cash giveaway, filling the coffers of groups that should not have received public funds. In its report the DOD watchdog concludes that Johnson  improperly co-sponsored NFEs that he had selected.  Auditors found that Johnson spent $301,000 on NFE sponsorships and recommend  corrective action.  The money flowed through a company called New Concepts Management Solutions (NCMS) that was evidently handpicked by Johnson. In 2012, the Office of Diversity Management hired a consulting firm called Deloitte for $480,554 to handle the diversity outreach allocations.Here s a brief breakdown of how some of the money was divided. The Thurgood Marshall College Fund Leadership Institute Conference got $25,000, the Society of American Indian Government Employees got $12,000 for a training conference and a conglomerate called Latina Style Outreach received $20,000. LULAC and the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Awards Corporation (HENAAC) received $25,000 each. It appears that Johnson knew well that he was violating agency rules when he headed the diversity crusade because the report reveals that the DOD Office of Special Counsel has consistently said that the agency should not  sponsor  non-federal entities like the ones Johnson gave money to. In addition to money, Johnson provided these various groups with logistical manpower compliments of Uncle Sam.It s unlikely that Johnson will face any repercussions for his transgressions or, at most, a weak slap on the hand. He certainly appears confident in testimony to investigators probing his violations.  My job is to grow, or focus on growing, the presence of minorities and women  in government jobs with higher pay scales, Johnson told investigators. He added that the mission of his office is diversity outreach, which involves informing the diverse audience. This is why he seeks affinity groups that have a  national reach  and influence.President Obama has made it his mission to culturally transform government by teaching federal workers about diversity, race and gender, healthcare disparities and cultural competencies. The effort has affected practically every major agency, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS), among others. It s been a costly initiative for taxpayers. A few months ago a Judicial Watch investigation found that the Obama administration has paid a Chicago-based firm millions of dollars to strengthen the federal workplace with its brand of diversity consulting. This includes two recent DHS contracts for $24,000 and $10,000 and one for $8,500 from the Department of Energy (DOE).

Launched by NOAA with a public relations fanfare, it was splashed across the world s media, and cited repeatedly by politicians and policy makers.But the whistleblower, Dr John Bates, a top NOAA scientist with an impeccable reputation, has shown The Mail on Sunday irrefutable evidence that the paper was based on misleading,  unverified  data.It was never subjected to NOAA s rigorous internal evaluation process   which Dr Bates devised.His vehement objections to the publication of the faulty data were overridden by his NOAA superiors in what he describes as a  blatant attempt to intensify the impact  of what became known as the Pausebuster paper.His disclosures are likely to stiffen President Trump s determination to enact his pledges to reverse his predecessor s  green  policies, and to withdraw from the Paris deal   so triggering an intense political row.

At Sunday night s big game, the singer used her moments in the spotlight to highlight racial tension   with her dancers wearing berets similar to those worn by the Black Panthers.Prior to the performance, some of Beyonc s dancers posed for a picture with their fists raised to the sky, evoking the black power salute by two prominent athletes during the 1968 Olympic Games.They also snapped a similar shot while holding a sign that said  Justice 4 Mario Woods,  referring to the 26-year-old man shot dead in December by San Francisco police.

"Feb 9, 2016","Will the Democrats ultimately choose a Marxist who s never accomplished a thing in his life or a serial criminal socialist? Choices choices MANCHESTER, N.H.   Hillary Clinton spoke of being  knocked down  and having problems with young voters in a bitter concession speech after losing to Sen. Bernie Sanders Tuesday night in the New Hampshire Democratic primary. I don t know what we d have done tonight if we d actually won. This is pretty exciting,  Clinton said to her crowd of supporters shortly after 9 PM Eastern Time, flanked onstage by husband Bill and daughter Chelsea, who did not speak.  I just want to say, I still love New Hampshire and I always will. People are angry. But there s also hungry. They re hungry for solutions. What are we going to do?,  Clinton said. I know I have some work to do, especially with young people,  Clinton said.  Even if they are not supporting me right now, I am supporting them It s not whether you get knocked down that matters, it s whether you get back up. Clinton devolved into an angry, ranting style by speech s end, calling for  human rights  for gays, women, workers, and others. She also pivoted to focus on South Carolina, which will be decided by the black vote, talking about how African-American parents should not have to worry about their kids being  harassed  or  shot,  and immigrant families should not have to  lie awake at night waiting for a knock on the door  signaling deportation.She also spoke of the contaminated water crisis in Flint, Michigan and of a hypothetical  grandmother  forced to choose between rent or food because some drug company raised medicine prices by 4,000 percent   an apparent reference to scandal-ridden former drug CEO Martin Shkreli.Clinton lost resoundingly to Sanders in the Granite State. By the time she finished her speech, Sanders was beating her 58.5 percent to 39.7 percent with 37 percent of the precincts reporting. CNN called the race for Sanders at approximately 8 PM.Sanders  win was fueled by a massive turnout by independent voters and non-Democrats.Forty-one percent of Democrat voters were independents and only 55 percent were registered Democrats, according to CNN exit polling.

Take, for example, the argument that it s an establishment of religion, because it favors Christians or other religious minorities. In 1944 we passed the War Refugee Act, which specifically was designed to rescue a hundred thousand Jews, and everybody knew the purpose was to rescue jews. That didn t establish Judaism as the state religion of the United States. I think the establishment argument will fail in the Supreme Court.

"February 1, 2016","Texas Senator Ted Cruz has won the 2016 Republican presidential caucus in Iowa. Cruz won with 99% of Iowa precincts reporting in. He earned 28% of the vote, with about 46,400 Republicans casting their vote for the social conservative.Cruz beat out Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, beating out the result of the highly respected Des Moines Register poll, that had put Trump ahead of Cruz by 5%.Many observers believe that Cruz was able to overcome Trump s constant media appearances and a campaign that sucked up a lot of the oxygen in the political world.While Cruz has won the caucus, history has not been kind to recent winners. The last two winners, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee, received a bump in support after winning the caucus, but were not able to martial the religious right on to success in other states like South Carolina and New Hampshire.Cruz also faces headwinds from Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who did better than expected in a third place finish. It can be expected that money from the Republican establishment will flow to Rubio, continuing the stampede away from Jeb Bush who only managed a single digit in Iowa and is not expected to be a strong contender in New Hampshire.In a strange turn of events, Trump could act as a spoiler candidate, wedged between Cruz and Rubio but without being beholden to big ticket donors or the party elite.For the general election, many Democrats are probably salivating over a candidate like Cruz. He is anti-choice, a darling of the extremist right, and a candidate who has based his entire run on turning out far right voters instead of even remotely attempting to appeal to moderate, swing voters. Trump may have scared the party so much that Cruz now appears  acceptable  to them, but not to America.Featured image via Flickr", Why Ted Cruz Winning The Iowa Caucus Could Doom The GOP
"February 1, 2017","Trump has wasted absolutely no time letting some of our allies know what he really thinks of them. On a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, he went off about a pledge the U.S. made to accept 1,250 refugees from a detention center in Australia. There are also rumors floating around that he threatened to send troops to Mexico if they don t get a handle on the border situation.While speaking to Mexico s president, Enrique Pena Nieto, last Friday, he allegedly told Nieto to control Mexico s  bad hombres,  or else we would send troops in to do it for him. The Associated Press first reported on an excerpt someone in the White House gave them of the phone call s transcript: You have a bunch of bad hombres down there,  Trump told Pena Nieto, according to the excerpt given to AP.  You aren t doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn t, so I just might send them down to take care of it. Both the White House and Pena Nieto are denying that the call went this way, but a Mexican news outlet published something similar to what the AP has, and even said Trump was humiliating Pena Nieto. If it is, indeed, true that Trump said these words, then he seriously just cut down and threatened one of our neighbors with military action, or worse, invasion. Which would be the next logical step seeing as how he s done everything else he can to piss Mexico off.With Australian Prime Minister Turnbull, who was trying to confirm that we d honor our pledge to accept refugees, Trump said,  This is the worst deal ever,  and accused Turnbull of trying to send the  next Boston bombers  to us. He also blasted Turnbull about how the deal was going to kill him politically, because that s really what matters to him. Actually doing his job? Meh.Australia is one of our closest allies and Trump not only tore into him, it sounds like he hung up on Turnbull, too, well before the call was scheduled to end.We ve fought alongside, and received support from, Australia in the Middle East. They are not an ally we want to alienate, and yet, here Trump is, working as hard as he possibly can to do just that until they fall in line with what he wants.He also spent part of the call bragging about his inauguration numbers   really? He s still not over that?Anybody who thought Trump would calm the hell down after winning the election, and actually treat foreign leaders with the dignity and respect of everyone else, was sorely mistaken. He uses Twitter to berate anyone with whom he has a disagreement   why would he treat foreign leaders any differently?When he s finished bullying the entire world, we won t have any allies left (except maybe Russia).Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images", Trump Just Threw APPALLING Temper Tantrums At Some Of Our Closest Allies On The Phone
"February 10, 2016","It looks as though the conservative target of choice this week to throw all their blind rage at is legendary artist Beyonc . After all, she had the audacity to perform at the Super Bowl and sing a song that points out police brutality. Something many conservatives don t want to admit actually exists against people of color.However, as they want to go after Beyonc  for being a woman of color with a powerful platform to get an important message across, what exactly are these conservatives doing to make the world a better place? Because as far as I can tell, Beyonc  has actually been the one doing just that for a long, long time.As Beyonc  uses her success to spread awareness, she s also using her earnings to make sure the homeless in Houston have a place to live. In fact, she gave $7 million over several years to help fund  Knowles Temenos Place Apartments  which helps house those who have been displaced. She, alongside her family and fellow Destiny s Child alum Kelly Roland, began this project in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.In Houston, it s actually illegal to feed the homeless. On top of that, it s illegal for the homeless to go in search of food for themselves. It s seems as if it s a pretty heartless society, and Beyonc  is actually stepping up where society has let these people down.Texas, that prides itself of on conservatism, even more so on their conservative Christianity, is letting their citizens down. While they love to boast that they re welcoming to business, they clearly are not welcome to much of anything else. Well, at least if you don t have money. However, part of being good Christians should be adhering to the teachings of the Bible, something Beyonc  seems to have actually taken to heart by taking action. After all, in the Bible, Jesus told everyone to take care of the sick and shelter the needy. Conservatives have seemed to have lost that message somewhere along the way while they were hating immigrants, the poor and needy, and while telling sick people if they can t afford healthcare, well, too bad.So, maybe next time, before criticizing someone for performing and speaking truth to power on a stage being broadcast around the world, just because it s difficult for you to hear and wrap your head around. Maybe, just maybe, listen to what s being said. Maybe, just maybe, realize there s an epidemic of police brutality that makes all the good officers look bad as well, and something needs to be done. And maybe, just maybe, realize the person who you are criticizing is a person you should emulate and appreciate for all they are doing for communities, those around her, and pretty much all of society. Then maybe, just maybe, you ll see something you ve never seen before   faith, hope and love.

"February 10, 2017","Donald Trump has no real platform other than be afraid, be very afraid. In Trump s imaginary world, we are all about to be wiped out by terrorists, but not the gun toting right-wing Trump follower type. No, we re all about to be killed by green card holding people from countries from the Middle East, but not actually from the countries that have ever attacked us. Earlier in the week, Trump s Press Secretary said this: I don t think it should be any surprise that the president, when it comes to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism, which is what that initially was supposed to be focused on, he is going to make sure that that is a major focus of his   keeping this country safe,  Spicer said.Source: OPBIf that s the case, then why the hell is the FBI terrorism task force worried about some peaceful protesters in the Midwest?The Guardian reports that the Trump administration has its FBI terrorism task force harassing people who are protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, instead of working to protect the lives of, you know, the American people. Instead, Trump seems to be redefining the word terrorism to fit anyone who interferes with his corporate or personal agenda. In this case, it s people who might interfere with oil company profits. The idea that the government would attempt to construe this indigenous-led non-violent movement into some kind of domestic terrorism investigation is unfathomable to me,  said Lauren Regan, a civil rights attorney who has provided legal support to demonstrators who were contacted by representatives of the FBI.  It s outrageous, it s unwarranted   and it s unconstitutional. Source: The GuardianNot only is this about enriching his buddies, but there is apparently a direct conflict of interest.Trump, a former investor in Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based firm behind the pipeline, took executive action in his first week in office to expedite the project. On Wednesday, workers began drilling to complete the pipeline across the Missouri river.There is so much that s disconcerting about this. Three days after a right-wing Trump supporting actual terrorist shot up a mosque in Canada, Trump removed any mention of right-wing terrorism from the website. Instead, he said he wanted to focus strictly on Islamic terrorism. So where exactly do protesters in the Midwest, many of whom are Native American fit in? It s simple, they don t. Trump is creating a new police state. We are either with him or against him and if we are against him, well, we too could be called terrorists.

"February 11, 2016","Ted Cruz s presidential campaign has pulled an ad featuring a softcore adult film star. The ad, titled  Conservatives Anonymous,  was an attack ad focused on Senator Marco Rubio. In the production, a support group for conservatives talks about being betrayed by Rubio and his flip-flop on immigration.One of the conservatives in the group is played by actress Amy Lindsay, who tells the group,  maybe you should vote for more than just a pretty face next time. When they were asked about Lindsay, the Cruz campaign apparently panicked.Lindsay has appeared in several softcore porn films, including Erotic Confessions, Carnal Wishes, Secrets of a Chambermaid, and Insatiable Desires.BuzzFeed News, after learning of Lindsay s prior filmography, requested comment from the Cruz campaign. Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told BuzzFeed News in a statement that the campaign is taking the ad down and replacing it with a different one. The actress responded to an open casting call. She passed her audition and got the job. Unfortunately, she was not vetted by the production company. Had the campaign known of her full filmography, we obviously would not have let her appear in the ad,  Tyler said.The revelation comes at a bad time for Cruz. He came in third place in the New Hampshire primary after winning the Iowa caucuses, and hopes to capitalize on social conservative support in order to win the South Carolina primary.Cruz was supported by the right-wing conservative Family Leader, who in the past has called for opposition to pornography which it lumped in with abortion and prostitution as a type of  coercion or stolen innocence. The ad had received praise from conservatives and journalists when it was released on YouTube earlier on Thursday.Now the YouTube page for the ad shows that the video  has been removed by the user.

"February 11, 2017","Donald Trump s most recent secretive actions toward the press are raising a lot of eyebrows and concerns.While Trump is on taxpayer-paid golf vacation in Florida, the undeserving POTUS has made sure that no one will know what the hell he s up to. To symbolize just how transparent his administration is, Trump has blacked out all the windows of his  Winter White House  and banned the press from taking any pictures and keeping tabs on him.Here s what AP reported Jill Colvin saw in the press pool area:Here s another photo of this disturbing activity:PoliticusUSA obtained a White House pool report, which stated: The pool was escorted into the clubhouse after Trump and Abe were out of view and then led downstairs to a filing room, where we re told we ll be staying for awhile. The door and windows are covered with black plastic so we can t see out. Photographers were instructed not to take pictures on the grounds of a  private club. While reporters may not always be blessed with ideal conditions when covering the president, being stuck in a basement with blacked out windows is highly problematic. This couldn t possibly be any more shady. Basically, American taxpayers just sent Trump on a paid vacation, and he s literally hiding from them.This shouldn t really be a surprise, considering the fact that Trump has ditched his press pool a few times before and has expressed a distinct hatred for journalists and the press as a whole. However, what Trump is doing is highly unethical. When you run for the highest office in the country, you work for the American people now and your life is no longer private. What Trump is trying to do is keep American citizens in the dark, and it is beyond disturbing.

"February 12, 2016","Right-wing actor James Woods is so upset that a liberal made fun of him on Twitter that he is suing for $10 million dollars. Woods, who has been in Hollywood for several decades, is part of a secretive Hollywood club of conservatives called Friends of Abe.A Twitter user, who goes by the name of  Abe List  has been sued by Woods, after he called the actor a cocaine addict. Woods is now attempting to uncover the true identity of the Twitter user and get an award of damages for the tweet.The spat began when Mr Woods posted on Twitter about a row between Bruce Jenner and Planned Parenthood.He wrote:  USATODAY app features Bruce Jenner s latest dress selection but makes zero mention of Planned Parenthood baby parts market. Abe List replied:  Cocaine addict James Woods still sniffing and spouting. He also referred to Mr Woods as a  joke  and  a ridiculous scum clown-boy .Woods often uses his account to post attacks and smears against President Obama and other liberals (he called Al Sharpton a  pimp ). In his lawsuit, Woods whines that  Abe List  is a  cowardly individual  who was the mastermind of a  malicious online campaign  to discredit the actor.In response Lisa Bloom, who is a lawyer representing Abe List, has pointed out that  suggestions that Mr Woods was on drugs was not meant to be taken literally. While Hollywood obviously leans heavily to the left, there are of course conservatives in that industry like there are everywhere else. Yet, it is an article of faith that Hollywood conservatives are somehow frozen out from opportunities in the industry, which helped lead to the creation of the Friends of Abe group. Deceased right-wing provocateur Andrew Breitbart was among the founders of the group, along with Gary Sinise, Kelsey Grammer, Lionel Chetwynd, Jon Voight.

"February 12, 2017","I can only imagine that the stack of resumes on Donald Trump s desk is full of spelling errors, which to the most anti-intellectual administration in recent American history, is certainly not a disqualifier, at least if we judge by the communications coming from the White House over the last three weeks.The horrendous spelling came early. During the campaign, Trump regularly misspelled words on his tweets. That hasn t changed. Shortly before Trump s inauguration, he tweeted about China, and managed to misspell the word  unprecedented.  He eventually fixed it, but it took nearly an hour and a half.More recently, though, Trump s education secretary, Betsy DeVos tweeted about W.E.B. Du Bois, but instead of spelling it the way the Civil Rights Leader and founder of the NAACP did, her tweet, which happened to fall during Black History Month, spelled his name DeBois.The department fairly quickly apologized, but not without misspelling  apologies.  Yes, that came from the department in charge of educating our children.In another embarrassing misspelling, this one a bit more tactile than a tweet, Trump s inaugural poster also has a misspelling:President Trump s official inauguration portrait offered by the Library of Congress had a glaring typo on it, social media users pointed out Sunday evening.The print of Trump, which was sold on the Library of Congress s website, includes a quote from the president   but misspells  too  as  to. No dream is too big, no challenge is to great. Nothing we want for the future is beyond our reach,  the quote reads on the poster.Source: The HillThe poster has been taken off the website, but not before some screenshots were taken.Is this a big deal in the overall scheme of things? Not really, but it does show a frightening trend within the Trump administration: no dedication to detail in a job where every single word matters. For example, it s been widely reported that Trump doesn t even read the executive orders he s pushing out on nearly a daily basis. He even signed away much of his power to the neo-nazi Steve Bannon.For the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban.Source: GQIf that sort of sloppiness, from the office of arguably the most powerful man in the world, doesn t terrify you, then nothing will.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images", Even Donald Trump’s Inauguration Poster Has A GLARING Misspelling (IMAGE)
"February 13, 2016","Ted Cruz summed up the significance of Justice Antonin Scalia s passing  quite nicely in the early parts of Saturday s GOP debate: the appointment of a liberal justice would completely destroy every Republican agenda for the foreseeable future. We are one Justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states. We are one Justice away from a supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalia s seminal decisions that upheld the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms. We are one Justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans, and the stakes of this election for this year, for the Senate, the Senate needs to stand strong and say  we re not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee. Yes, a more liberal Justice would reverse the 2008 Heller decision, which for the first time in our nation s history affirmed the right of men like George Zimmerman, the Bundy  militia,  and other violent people to own firearms. A more liberal Justice would definitely  undermine  what conservatives call  religious liberty  these days   the  right  to deny service based on sexual orientation, the right to discriminate in the name of God.Cruz is right: Scalia s death emphasizes the importance of the upcoming election.

Now, it seems that things have gotten so hot that Trump s loyal and treasured national security adviser, Retired General Michael Flynn, has resigned.This move comes after a flurry of reports concerning Flynn s pre-inauguration contacts with Russian officials.

One group, however, has always strongly supported him   the Stupid Part of America   and he s about to lose them, too. Trump s popularity with conservatives has soared since he began screaming about a god he will never actually understand, baby parts, and other favorite talking points of theirs   but his recent remarks about Planned Parenthood may lose him a lot of support among the segment of the population who are dumb enough to fall for heavily-edited propaganda videos.At the insanely heated GOP debate, Ted Cruz managed to trick The Donald into defending Planned Parenthood. During one of the screaming matches between Trump and Cruz that have become rather commonplace, the Texas Senator accused the billionaire of supporting federal funding of Planned Parenthood. Eventually, he managed to goad Trump into supporting Planned Parenthood, though The Donald still spoke out against abortion. But let me say more blunt Donald you notice didn t agree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood and Donald has this weird pattern, when you point to his own record he screams  Liar! Liar! Liar! ,  Cruz said, pointing out that Trump has, in the past, said Planned Parenthood does  wonderful things.  Trump replied: It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion. There are wonderful things having to do with women s health, but not when it comes to abortion. Planned Parenthood absolutely does do wonderful things. But unlike Trump s assertion, those wonderful things include giving women access to a safe, sanitary abortion if they choose to have one. Planned Parenthood also provides numerous irreplaceable services to women that have nothing at all to do with abortion, as well as informs women of alternatives to terminating a pregnancy   like adoption. In fact, only three percent of the organization s services are abortion-related.Unfortunately for Trump, this moment of honesty about Planned Parenthood will haunt him right up until election day   because conservatives simply don t care about women.Watch the exchange below:Featured image via screengrab", Conservatives Will HATE What Donald Trump Just Said About Planned Parenthood (VIDEO)

If that were the case, then that would escalate things,  one official briefed on the investigation told CNN.More than  a baker s dozen intelligence agencies have previously confirmed that Vladimir Putin personally spearheaded a massive hacking and propaganda/ fake news  campaign targeting Clinton in an effort to get Donald Trump elected.Since assuming office,  Easy D  has been nothing but friendly to Russia, even easing sanctions that targeted the very intelligence agencies that hacked our election and constantly praising Putin (including on the same day that Flynn spoke to his ambassador friend).

"February 15, 2016","After the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, many people have offered up their opinions on what should happen in regards to who should replace him. It is the president s constitutional duty to nominate someone for the role, however several Republicans have voiced their dissent, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).Directly after the announcement of Scalia s passing, McConnell wrote on Facebook a message of condolence for his family alongside this remark. The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President. However, according to Sarah Burgess on Twitter, McConnell contradicts his own current views. In the 1970-71 Kentucky Law Journal, McConnell wrote: At the outset, the Senate should discount the philosophy of the nominee. In our politically centrist society, it is highly unlikely that any Executive would nominate a man of such extreme views of the right of the left as to be disturbing to the Senate. However, a nomination, for example, of a Communist or a member of the American Nazi Parly, would have to be considered an exception to the recommendation that the Senate leave ideological considerations to the discretion of the Executive. Political and philosophical considerations were often a factor in the nineteenth century and arguably in the Parker, Haynsworth and Carswell cases also, but this is not proper and tends to degrade the Court and dilute the constitutionally proper authority of the Executive in this area. The President is presumably elected by the people to carry out a program and altering the ideological directions of the Supreme Court would seem to be a perfectly legitimate part of a Presidential platform. To that end, the Constitution gives to him the power to nominate. As mentioned earlier, if the power to nominate had been given to the Senate, as was considered during the debates at the Constitutional Convention, then it would be proper for the Senate to consider political philosophy. The proper role of the Senate is to advise and consent to the particular nomination, and thus, as the Constitution puts it,  to appoint.  This taken within the context of modern times should mean an examination only into the qualifications of the President s nominee. According to himself, McConnell would have to agree President Obama is within his full right and duty as Commander-in-Chief to nominate someone who he deems appropriate for the role of Supreme Court Justice. Even if that means  altering the ideological directions of the Supreme Court.  He should still see that to be  perfectly legitimate. However, with the times being as they are during an election year, you can see why Republicans are terrified of an Obama nominee, because the implications would be huge surrounding several cases, including cases surrounding voting rights.To say the least, it s not surprising that McConnell is a giant hypocrite contradicting even himself and his own view of the law. Hopefully he ll come to his senses sooner rather than later.Featured image: Flickr", Mitch McConnell SLAMS His Own SCOTUS-Obstructing Ways In ‘Kentucky Law Journal’
"February 15, 2017","As Trump prepares to kick off his 2020 campaign so he can avoid doing real work in the White House, a new poll has devastating news for him: If the 2020 election were held tomorrow, a generic, unnamed Democrat would beat him. That means that more people would vote for pretty much any Democrat in order to keep Trump from being re-elected.The Politico/Morning Consult poll has 43 percent of respondents saying they would probably pick the Democrat even without a name right now. Only 35 percent said they would vote for Trump.Worse, the number of Trump voters who would vote for him again is slipping. 71 percent of Trump voters said they d vote for him again, compared to 87 percent of Hillary s voters who would vote for the generic Democrat.And perhaps even worse than that is the fact that 26 percent of people who answered this poll believe Trump is the worst president we ve had since WWII. 25 percent hold that same opinion of Obama, but Trump s presidency is all of one month old. Obama served his eight years and has a legacy for people to look at.It s really not often that people believe history will view a president that badly just thirty days into his first term.For Trump, where his image and ego are everything, the idea that people would rather support a generic someone over him has got to be horrifying. This is a poll he would probably call  fake news,  because of the people who line the streets outside Mar a Lago (who are protesters), and all the electoral votes he won, and so on.Add all of this to the fact that he really is planning a campaign event in Florida for this weekend, and has declared himself eligible for candidacy for 2020 already, and what it shows right now is that people believe he can t do the job. Presidents often enjoy a certain  honeymoon  period with both the press and the populace following their election. Trump has been screwing up so badly so quickly that his honeymoon didn t even happen.The only people who still think he s doing a good job are his most ardent supporters.

To drive this point home, some on the campaign trail are pointing to his record of accomplishments on Capital Hill, noting that he has only had three (yes   3) bills passed into law that he s sponsored over 25 years in Congress. Doesn t sound like that great of a record, does it? Yet   what they fail to mention is that his record of successes is almost IDENTICAL to Hillary Clinton s. In fact, Sanders has a higher success rate.We back this up with proven numbers. Go to Congress.gov. You can look up every single bill that present (and past) members of Congress have ever sponsored/co-sponsored during their entire time as elected representatives of the people.Bernie Sanders sponsored 780 bills. He also co-sponsored 5,430 bills. Out of his sponsored bills, only three became law, meaning his success rate = .38 percent. Once you factor in his sponsored bills with his co-sponsored bills, his success rate isn t all that much improved. Out of 6,210 bills, only 206 became law.That brings his total success rate to 3.3 percent.Hillary sponsored 703 laws and guess what, only 3 became law (the same as Bernie). That gives her a success rate of .42 percent. That s barely above Sanders. But   take a look at what happens when you factor in her co-sponsored bills. Out of the 3,379 bills she supported, only 77 became law.That gives her a total success rate of 2.2 percent.That s below Sanders, but, we ll just go ahead and say they re nearly identical.So, as we were saying, there s a myth going around that Sanders can t get anything done because he s too far left, but as you can see, his record of accomplishments in Congress isn t that far off from Hillary s (at least according to the official Congressional record). If this isn t absolute proof, then we don t know what is.The truth is, it s not that far-left progressives can t get anything done in Washington, it s that Congress is set up in a way that makes it virtually impossible for anyone to get anything passed. That s the way it s supposed to be (by design). That s why Bernie has continuously said on the campaign trail that it s absolutely imperative that people become more involved (and vote), otherwise, they won t see the change they re hoping for, no matter if he (or anyone else for that matter) is elected president. This nonsense about him being  too progressive to get anything passed  needs to stop, no matter who you support for the nomination.Featured image via Bernie Sanders", Bernie Is Too Far Left To Get Anything Done?

"February 16, 2017","Even Fox News is calling Donald Trump out for attacking the media.After a press conference that will go down as the most embarrassing and confusing ever given in this nation s history, Fox News host Shep Smith blasted Trump for attacking the press, specifically CNN reporter Jim Acosta.Trump often praises Fox News while bashing the other major news outlets and once again attacked the media during his first solo press conference in which he appeared to be just telling reporters what he was told to tell them.Trump repeatedly referred to CNN as  fake news  and personally attacked Acosta while he was trying to ask questions about the Russia scandal that has engulfed the White House. Russia is fake news,  Trump claimed. Russia   this is fake news put out by the media .The leaks are real. You re the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said. You saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. If the information coming from the leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?  Acosta asked.Trump responded by trashing CNN for not taking him at his word instead of verifying his claims and reporting the truth. He then praised Fox & Friends for kissing his ass like a good propaganda machine. When you call it fake news, you re undermining the confidence in the news media,  Acosta shot back. Trump replied by telling Acosta that he knows when he should get good or bad stories in the news and suggested that the media should get in line and write the stories he wants them to write.Seriously.Trump went on to excuse his demand by saying he won the election and claimed his administration is running smoothly despite all the recent reports that say otherwise.Well, Shep Smith was not amused and he took Trump to the woodshed for it.First, Smith addressed Trump s disastrous attempt to hold a big boy conference all by himself. It s sort of our job to let you know when things are said that aren t true,  Smith said in defense of the media.  This president keeps telling untrue things and he does it every single time he s in front of a microphone   some of them aren t really big, but they re coming from the president. He then attacked the logic of Trump s claim that Russia is  fake news. He says Russia is a ruse, it s fake news. The leaks are real, but the news is fake. So, that s impossible. It s very confusing,  especially when Trump says thing that are  demonstrably, unquestionably, opinion aside, 100 percent false. Then Smith passionately defended Acosta. He s an accomplished reporter   a guy I ve never met, but a good reporter. [Trump was] treating him like   I m not even going to use the word. I m not going to give Twitter the love it needs. It s crazy what we re watching everyday, it s absolutely crazy. He keeps repeating ridiculous throwaway lines that are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia, as if we re some kind of fools for asking the question. Really?  Smith continued into an epic conclusion.  Your opposition was hacked, and the Russians were responsible for it, and your people were on the phone with Russia on the same day it was happening, and we re fools for asking the questions? No, sir, we are not fools for asking this question, and we demand to know the answer to this question. You owe this to the American people. We have a right to know, we absolutely do, and that you call us  fake news  and put us down like children for asking this question is inconsequential. The people deserve that answer. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself and the media should absolutely keep doing their jobs by calling out Trump s lies every day.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images"," WATCH: Fox News Host DEFENDS CNN Reporter, Tells Trump To Go F*ck Himself"
"February 17, 2016","When you re running for office, especially when you re running for President of the United States, you re going to say and do whatever is necessary to get votes to put you into office. However, part of your job as a candidate is to also make sure you are not only holding yourself accountable for the things that you say, but also for what the people in your supporting crowds are saying. For instance, when John McCain stood up for Barack Obama back in the 2008 election when one of his supporters was saying awful things about the then senator.It seems Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla) has yet to learn that very important lesson, and it may come back to haunt him. At a recent campaign event in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Rubio was addressing the crowd and telling everyone that if he were to become president he would never close down the military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It was after these remarks that a person in the crowd decided to shout,  WATERBOARD HILLARY!  Which was a clear reference to both the torture that occurred at Guantanamo as well as how some people would like to harm and torture former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Now, Rubio, clearly hearing what had been said because he chuckled, decided to just laugh it off and ignore it. He knew it was bad, because he said he didn t want to make a deal of it as the media was there to record everything. And record they did. They recorded Rubio shrugging the entire thing off instead of asking the man not to say such a terrible thing. Which, in all honestly, would ve made Rubio look like a better human being. However, knowing jerks like Donald Trump are leading in the polls after not only allowing horrible things to be said, but saying horrible things himself, Rubio probably figures his base will enjoy these sort of shenanigans.Needless to say, Rubio shrugging off a call for torture on a former First Lady and Secretary of State as well as a current candidate for president isn t at all surprising, but it doesn t make it any less appalling.Here s the video: Video/Featured image: CNN", Marco Rubio Seems To Think Harming Hillary Clinton Is A Funny Idea (VIDEO)
"February 17, 2017","Donald Trump is dangerous as president. Anyone who has been watching this trainwreck first in campaign mode, and then during transition, and now during the actual presidency, knows this. Unfortunately, the Republicans in Washington who are in a position to actually do something seem to be completely ignoring the fact that Trump is completely out of his mind, has shown himself to be a dangerous authoritarian, and, most troubling of all, seems to have some very scary ties to Russia and its autocratic leader, Vladimir Putin.Well, there is one person on television who isn t going to mince words when it comes to Trump: Bill Maher, host of HBO s Real Time. On Friday night, Maher really let Trump have it. He lit into the disastrous insanity that was Trump s first solo press conference as president, and then went on to blatantly call Trump a nutcase. He even said that in some ways, Trump is actually WORSE than German dictator Adolf Hitler: You know your Facebook friend who said he thought Trump was Hitler? He was optimistic. What we have here is a mental patient who thinks he s Hitler. The kid in the YouTube video who is high from the dentist made more sense. Maher then went on to remind his audience not to get distracted by smaller outrages so that we take our eyes off the really dangerous happenings within the Trump White House, and indeed, with Trump himself: While you re watching the clown screw the pony, they re breaking into your car. At the end of the day, there s just too much goodness and vital truth in this monologue to even begin to do it justice. All I know is that Bill Maher will be a very important voice when it comes to helping America make it through this presidency with our sanity intact.Watch the brilliant video below:Featured image via video screen capture", Maher EVISCERATES Trump’s Insane Presser; Gets Real About How Dangerous He Is (VIDEO)
"February 18, 2016","Grab your popcorn, everybody! The Tea Party civil war has kicked off with an all-out battle of stupid between Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin.Their feud has raged largely under the radar since September when Beck fired the first salvo by calling the former half-term Alaska Governor a clown for talking to Donald Trump during an anti-Iran rally. I m going to say it,  Beck announced. I don t care what Sarah Palin says any more. Sarah Palin has become a clown. I m embarrassed that I was once for Sarah Palin. Honestly, I m embarrassed  I don t know who she is any more, I don t know what she stands for. I saw a clip of her talking to Donald Trump. What the hell is that? I don t even know who she is any more. As we all know by now, Beck is a HUGE supporter of Republican presidential wannabe Ted Cruz, so of course that means anybody who doesn t support Cruz is dead to Beck. And that included Palin.And when America s village idiot actually endorsed Trump in an incoherent rant that left everybody craving a Yosemite Sam cartoon, Beck went nuclear on Facebook. Sarah Palin. Small Government, lower taxes, fewer regulations and the constitution? Not any more. Big government Sad excuse to abandon principles. Just because things don t go my way, I don t abandon God. Saul Alinsky is wrong. The ends do not justify the means. But wait! There s more!After a week in which Beck appeared with Cruz to get all teary eyed about  Murica and how Cruz will rule the land with God on his right shoulder whispering in his ear what to do, Palin fired back at her former friend on Thursday.Writing on her Facebook page about Beck s love affair with a man she once shared the Tea Party with, Palin went after Beck on several fronts and did not show any mercy whatsoever. Ted Cruz s star spokesman and campaign partner, Glenn Beck, promises he will support a socialist vs. the pro-life, pro-2nd amendment, pro-growth, pro-American GOP front runner  what s conservative about that?  Palin began in reference to Beck saying he would support Bernie Sanders before he ever supports Trump.Then she pointed out that Beck once said that John McCain would have been worse for the country than President Obama.Palina also slammed Beck for proclaiming his hatred of the American victims of the 9/11 terrorists attacks, and then attacked Beck and Cruz for greeting immigrants at the border.In conclusion, Palin wrote:Beck is known for his continuous mocking of Americans who may disagree with his puzzling antics, while crying just last night,  Why mock ME?  what s consistent about that?Beck will go ballistic after reading this post and will ramp up his unjustified attacks against Donald Trump, me, my faith, and you   for acknowledging all this I ve outlined, in his own words  what s smart about that?Here s her full post via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Ted Cruz s star spokesman and campaign partner, Glenn Beck, promises he will support a socialist vs. the pro-life, Posted by Sarah Palin on Thursday, February 18, 2016Palin just delivered a direct hit on Beck and now we all get to wait for his response, which probably won t be for too long. And we can definitely expect Beck and Palin to continue their feud in the fight for which crazy GOP candidate gets to lose in November to Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.These two were so much happier before they met other crazy people.

"February 18, 2017","Everyone remembers who died at Bowling Green thanks to Kellyanne Conway. Everyone remembers who died in Atlanta thanks to Sean Spicer. And the truth is that those of us who didn t die at Bowling Green died in Atlanta. Or did we? Donald Trump held a rally in Florida today, where he discussed, or rather, fear-mongered, about terrorism, and referenced yet another completely imaginary terror attack. This one happened last night in Sweden, supposedly, and it s fairly safe to assume we all died there, too. You look at what s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers, they re having problems like they never thought possible. The thing is, there were no terror attacks in Sweden last night. There was an incident at the Turkish embassy in Sweden on the 15th, but that was specifically against Turkey, possibly by supporters of an organization that has been operating mainly in Turkey for the last 30 years. And Turkish establishments in Sweden have been having problems like this for years, which makes it unlikely that these people were refugees. But refugees are what Trump was trying to scare his crowd over with this new fake attack: We ve allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country, and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation, there was no nothing. BULL. SHIT. The vetting process has been explained so many times by so many people now that it s a wonder anybody at all can still lap this liquid baloney up the way they do.Finding news about any terror attacks anywhere on the European continent last night is difficult. In fact, news about terror attacks last night is coming mostly from India and Pakistan. Most of that news seems to speculate whether India is behind terror attacks in Pakistan.There are a few stories about terrorism in Israel. But pretty much nothing from Europe, and certainly nothing from Scandinavia. Yet Trump went on and on about how we have no way of knowing who s coming into the country by claiming that Sweden is having problems they ve never had before. It s a truly dark time when someone who calls himself President of the United States has to lie in order to spread the proper amount of fear.And truth be told, fear-mongering is bad enough. What Trump is doing is a squillion times worse.

"February 19, 2016","A super PAC backing Ted Cruz s presidential campaign is using the confederate flag to promote their candidate and attack another Republican.The  Courageous Conservatives  PAC is now calling primary voters in South Carolina with a robocall that attacks Donald Trump and Governor Nikki Haley for their supposed opposition to the pro-slavery symbol.The ad and robocall start with audio of Trump stating,  Put it in a museum, let it go.  It goes on to state that Trump supported Haley in removing  the battle flag  from a memorial on the statehouse grounds. People like Donald Trump are always butting their noses into other people s businesses. Trump talks about our flag like it s a social disease,  the robocall said.It said Trump  ridiculed our values  and that voters should  send Donald Trump and his New York values back to Manhattan. The creators of the ad said they have called 80,000 homes in the state so far with this racist message, in the hopes that it will cut into the considerable lead most show for Trump.The ad comes after the tragic shooting of black churchgoers by a white supremacist in Charleston pushed Haley and other lawmakers around the country to finally begin moving the flag from state property.The confederate flag was erected in many southern states in reaction to the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 60s.Of course the confederacy was a separatist movement that declared open war on the legitimate U.S. government in order to defend the evil institution of slavery, in which black people were kept as property and free labor.Despite the Republican Party s own report in which it indicated that its loss of the 2012 election came about in part due to its candidate s inability to reach out to racial minorities, there is still a strong base of support within the right in favor of racist causes. This is just more evidence that the party simply hasn t done the work to exclude open racists from their shrinking coalition.Featured image via Flickr", Big Time Racists Are Backing This Republican For President (VIDEO)
"February 19, 2017","Trump drew international attention again by claiming there was a terror attack in Sweden on the night of Feb. 17. To cover his gross lie, he tweeted today that his remarks were in reference to something Fox News reported, which is either just another lie, or a gross misunderstanding of a documentary Fox News aired. But it seems that there really was a terror attack in Sweden recently, in a city called Gothenburg.The suspected terrorists in this attack were Neo-Nazis, and they attacked a refugee center in Gothenburg with a homemade bomb last month. One person was seriously injured in the attack.Swedish intelligence said that the attack was linked to two others in Gothenburg, and appeared to be politically motivated, which isn t shocking if the terrorists were white Neo-Nazis, and members of a white supremacist group known as the Nordic Resistance Movement. They openly preach anti-Semitism and racism, and they oppose non-white immigration into Sweden.Hmmm. That sounds an awful lot like all the white supremacists here in the U.S. who support Trump.Sweden has taken in more refugees per capita than anyone else in Europe in 2016, despite imposing border controls in the middle of the year. What we have now, however, are white supremacists attacking a refugee center. Trump wants to blame refugees for terror attacks all across Europe, but that doesn t work when the terrorists are white Neo-Nazis.This is how this administration operates, though. Tell a lie, make a wild accusation, or say or do something equally outrageous, watch it get debunked or solidly smacked down, and then double down on it by either blaming it on faulty information or sticking by it anyway. And they won t acknowledge terror attacks that don t fit their anti-Muslim narrative.Featured image by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images"," There WAS A Terror Attack In Sweden Recently, But Trump Won’t Like Who The Terrorists Were"
"February 2, 2016","Seldom in life are there truly head scratching moments that make you question all life and sanity, but Donald Trump being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize is definitely one of those moments. And no, this isn t satire.According to the announcement of those who have been nominated: US Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump has also been nominated for the prize, according to Nobel watcher Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo.According to a copy of the nomination letter Harpviken said he had received, brash tycoon Trump   who has attracted international condemnation by calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States   deserves the prize for  his vigorous peace through strength ideology, used as a threat weapon of deterrence against radical Islam, ISIS, nuclear Iran and Communist China . However, it was definitely made known that anyone can be nominated, so his nomination is not indicative of his actual actions and behavior. Thousands of people around the world are allowed to make nominations for the Peace Prize, including members of parliament and government ministers, former laureates and some university professors.The Nobel Institute accepts all valid nominations, so having one s name on the list is not to be taken as a sign of approval. Further proof that anyone, and I mean anyone, can be nominated can be found in the fact that right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh was also nominated many years ago.Clearly, Trump shouldn t be a top contender considering his play for peace is through hate and war. Which, of course, in fancy-speak would sound something like  vigorous peace through strength .. but no, it s rather sanity through means of insanity, and it doesn t add up.Other nominees include  Germany s Angela Merkel, Pope Francis, and the Greek islanders who helped desperate migrants.  Edward Snowden, the man who leaked intel for the sake of fame reform is also a contender.At the end of the day, anyone can be nominated, but it doesn t mean that they ll win. However, the fact that Trump was even nominated is terrifying in and of itself. We ll find out this October who actually takes home the prize. Hopefully, it will go to someone most deserving.

"February 2, 2017","Republicans in Hawaii punished the first female House Minority Leader for putting country before party.Prior to and after the election, state Rep. Beth Fukumoto took a stand against Donald Trump. She criticized him for his treatment of women and minorities and refused to blindly follow Trump.Criticism is a form of free speech, but Fukumoto is now being punished for exercising her constitutional rights by her own party.Fukumoto served as the House Minority Leader of the Republican Party in the state legislature, but no longer holds that position after her party punished her for criticizing Trump at the Women s March last month. They told me they would keep me in this position if I would commit to not disagreeing with our president for the remainder of his term,  Fukumoto explained during a speech on the House floor.  Mr. Speaker, I m being removed because I refused to make that commitment, because I believe it s our job as Americans and as leaders in this body to criticize power when power is wrong. Indeed, dissent is an American value, especially when the president is acting like petulant child tyrant.Fukumoto was told by a Republican colleague that as House Minority Leader, her first duty should be to the party. You are speaking not for yourself anymore,  Rep. Bob McDermott responded.  It is a high-level responsibility. And he is totally wrong.The first duty of any American in public office is to the country and the people, not the interests of the party. Putting party and power first is selfish and blinds lawmakers to seeing what is best for the nation.McDermott repeatedly argued with other Republican women in the state legislature and Fukumoto was replaced as House Minority Leader by a male lawmaker.Fukumoto told KHON that she expressed her concerns about Trump during the Women s March the day after the inauguration. The Republican Party is getting increasingly hostile to different opinions. If you followed what happened at the state convention, I got booed for about 10 minutes straight for raising concerns about President Trump, then nominee Trump, and the way he treated women and minorities in many of his remarks. I, at the time, had said this is not, this should not reflect our party I repeated those sentiments at the Women s March last week.And since then, there have been many calls for my resignation, and my caucus members have raised concerns about whether or not that means I m a Republican, whether or not that means I m fit for leadership, whether or not that means I should even be an elected official. My caucus has asked me to stop speaking out about Trump and to make a commitment. They ve said they ll keep me as minority leader if I make a commitment not to speak out against Trump for the remainder of his term. I don t think that s our job as elected officials, even more so, I don t think that s our job as citizens. So Fukumoto is now reaching out to her constituents asking them if they would be okay with her joining the Democratic Party.Here s the video via KHON.Fukumoto should not have been punished for criticizing Donald Trump. But Republicans increasingly believe that anyone who criticizes them and their policies should be punished, the Constitution be damned.The fact that Republicans replaced Fukumoto with a man speaks volumes about how much Republicans value women and it s an insult that should be answered with protests and a landslide victory for Democrats at the ballot box for generations until Republican learn to respect women, the country, and the Constitution that they claim to hold so dear.Featured Image: YouTube", Hawaii Republicans Punish Female Party Leader For Criticizing Trump At Women’s March
"February 20, 2016","At this point in the race, it s pretty clear that Donald Trump would be a disaster for the country. His divisive and racist statements about Mexicans and Muslims have caused an uproar with many. His policies on everything from foreign policy to economics are incoherent and juvenile and he would most certainly be dangerous as the next president of the United States. However, there s someone way more dangerous lurking just behind Trump, and that s Texas senator Ted Cruz.Yes, it s been established that Cruz is quite a creepy guy and I m not only referring to his facial expressions or his smirk. Just take a look at what he and his campaign did in Iowa. His campaign propagated that Ben Carson dropped out of the race to get people to vote for Cruz. His campaign also sent out mailers to voters to guilt them into voting for Cruz. However, those alone aren t the reasons. Here is just the first of four reasons why Ted Cruz is the most dangerous person lurking around for the presidency: Number one, Cruz is an ideologue:  Cruz is driven by ideology. Cruz doesn t think there s man made climate change, he rejects same sex marriage, wants to abolish the IRS, holds that everyone has a right to guns, and thinks that there should be no divide between church and state, loves the death penalty, rejects immigration reform, demand the repeal of Obamacare, and he takes a strict originalist view of the Constitution.

"February 21, 2016","On February 20, Justin Linden went out to caucus for Bernie Sanders in Clark County, Nevada.As he was waiting to be counted,  he says he saw a volunteer begin passing out ballots to Hillary Clinton supporters, who already had ballots in their hands. When he tried to ask why this was being done, Linden says his questions were ignored.That s when he took out his cell phone and started recording.Over the next 28 minutes, Linden captured footage that shows how easily the caucus process can be manipulated.At the time of the count, there were 33 caucus-goers present to support Bernie Sanders. There were 21 present to support Hillary Clinton.According to caucus rules, only people who are actually present are supposed to be included in the final tally.Yet after the official count was taken, Linden was stunned to see officials adding ballots to the count, from people who were not there.Suddenly, to everyone s surprise, the count on Hillary Clinton s side began to rise.Another caucus-goer, Rhiannon Frauenfeld, confirmed that this is exactly what happened.Frauenfeld told Addicting Info:With the paper ballots of absentee people included, it was 42/31 Bernie still leading. As she went to walk away after counting the Hillary ballots she turns back around and pulls out ballots that were in her hands and counts several more. This is when we were all confused because we didn t know where these ballots came from. She had been holding everything so we didn t know if they were ballots she already counted or where she got them.It gets worse from there.As documented in Linden s video, the tally on Clinton s side continues to rise, although no-one is sure where these extra ballots keep coming from.Linden provided us with a timeline from the video, noting that all of the volunteers mentioned were wearing Hillary Clinton shirts.Here s an overview of the major events, as Linden describes them;6 minutes: Volunteer claims Hillary now has (37) ballots. Is questioned where the extra ballots came from and does not reply.7.5 minutes: Volunteer 1 claims there are even more ballots to add to the count.10.5 minutes: Volunteer 1 claims there are even more ballots to add to the count.12.25 minutes: Volunteer 1 comes back and says  with the extra added,  both camps are tied (42) to (42).

Nor is there any way to know if people filled out multiple ballots.In any case, according to the Nevada Democratic Party s website, people who are not physically present cannot be counted during a caucus.Frauenfeld told us: While I can t say conclusively that I believe that the conduct was a deliberate attempt to cheat the count, it raised doubts about the legitimacy of the process. I feel there was an attempt to skew the results toward Hillary, their favored candidate. Linden told us he believes that the volunteers were aware that they were only supposed to count people who were present.He told us, I find it strange that it was called as an even tie, before the volunteer actually collected the ballots. Linden also said, I find it more strange that Hillary s number kept going up with every count, and that was fine with them, but when a third of the Bernie ballots disappeared, it wasn t an issue.

"February 21, 2017","When Donald Trump pulled a terror attack in Sweden out of his ass at a Florida rally over the weekend, he tried to cover his lie by saying he was referencing a documentary about rising crime in Sweden. That documentary blames Sweden s immigrant and refugee population for the crime, and Fox News  Tucker Carlson ran a portion of an interview between filmmaker Ami Horowitz and a couple of Swedish police officers from that documentary.And what Horowitz did with it has these two officers in complete shock. Horowitz says that Muslim refugees are responsible for a sharp increase in gun violence and rape, which is the basis of his documentary. One officer says that the interview was about areas with high rates of crime, but there was no focus on migration or immigration: We don t stand behind it. It shocked us. He has edited the answers. We were answering completely different questions in the interview. This is bad journalism. Paranoia and racism generally make for bad journalism, but fear-mongering conservatives don t seem to care. Tucker Carlson should have known better than to air a segment to push the right s anti-immigrant agenda, but he didn t. And Horowitz is trying to defend his  investigation  despite the horror his own interview subjects have expressed over the editing. He even claims he told them this would be about migrants and immigrants.But Horowitz also claims that the officers are the ones who used the term  no-go zones  to describe communities that have large Muslim-immigrant populations. For the record,  no-go zones  has been a rumor circulating around conservative media for quite some time   they like to claim that these zones are only open to Muslims, and some of them are so strict that any non-Muslim caught there faces punishment under Sharia law, and outside of the country s law. Local police are said to avoid these areas entirely.It s also a flat-out lie.But Horowitz tried to reclaim some credibility by saying his  record stands for itself: I ve never had a subject claim, and certainly not prove, that I ever misled them or ever doctored the footage. It s never happened before. So, my record stands for itself, and what you saw on that video clear as day stands for itself. The big question is, what possible motive would these two officers have to discredit Horowitz and Fox News? Horowitz says their bosses pressured them to disavow the interviews so they wouldn t be labeled racists. That s not likely true because, if nothing else, the data shows that despite the spike in migrants in Sweden over the last several years, crime has not similarly risen, let alone skyrocketed.You have a problem when your interview subjects say,  That s not what we said, that s not what we meant, that s not even what we were asked about.  Horowitz and Carlson owe the world an apology, but it seems that conservative personalities increasingly believe personal responsibility only applies to other people.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images", Swedish Police APPALLED At Level Of Deception In Film Trump Blamed For His ‘Terror Attack’ Lie

Bernie Sanders taking to the floor in the House of Representatives in response to the slur from Republican Rep. Duke Cunningham.Cunningham used the term when he said,  Is there any shocking doubt, the same people that would vote to cut defense $177 billion, the same ones that would put homos in the military, the same ones that would not fund BRAC, the same ones that would not clean up  Then Sanders cut him short:https://www.facebook.com/HuffingtonPost/videos/10153689923086130/ My ears may have been playing a trick on me, but I thought I heard the gentleman a moment ago say something quote unquote about homos in the military,  Sanders said.  Was I right in hearing that expression? Absolutely,  Cunningham responded.  Putting homosexuals in the military. Was the gentleman referring to the thousands and thousands of gay people who have put their lives on the line in countless wars defending this country? Was that the groups of people that the gentleman was referring to? You have insulted thousands of men and women who have put their lives on the line,  Sanders continued.  I think they are owed an apology. Even conservative Republicans don t use language like that anymore (at least in public), but it is jarring to hear that kind of slur from a member on the floor of the House, just a little over twenty years ago.While Duke Cunningham didn t back down to Sanders, a decade after this exchange, karma caught up with him. Cunningham was arrested and charged with accepting at least $2.4 million in bribes and underreporting his taxable income. In 2005 he pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud and tax evasion.

When some of her followers noted that the sign held by one of the people said  New England,  Heath indicated that the  woman in photo is wearing a Clark County GOP voting sticker. This was #NVCaucus.

"February 23, 2017","Republicans across the country have been doing all they can to avoid town hall meetings where angry constituents are waiting. But Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) should win some type of award for his despicable excuse.Earlier this week, Gohmert claimed that he hadn t scheduled a town hall meeting to discuss important issues with the people he represents because with all the angry protesters around he s afraid of a shooting like the one that involved Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. But don t worry. This isn t because he s a coward. It s just that he wants to keep his constituents safe. Unfortunately, at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety. Threats are nothing new to me and I have gotten my share as a felony judge. However, the House Sergeant at Arms advised us after former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot at a public appearance, that civilian attendees at Congressional public events stand the most chance of being harmed or killed   just as happened there. In a scathing statement, Giffords slammed Gohmert for his cowardly comments and basically told him to grow a pair. She pointed out that her offices were open after her shooting. Giffords added that the representative who took her place during that difficult time also continued to hold town halls rather than hide from the people. Her statement ended by shaming Gohmert and telling him, point blank, to  have some courage. I was shot on a Saturday morning. By Monday morning my offices were open to the public. Ron Barber   at my side that Saturday, who was shot multiple times, then elected to Congress in my stead   held town halls. It s what the people deserve in a representative. In the past year, campaigning for gun safety, I have held over 50 public events. To the politicians who have abandoned their civic obligations, I say this: Have some courage. Face your constituents. Hold town halls. Giffords followed her statement up with a tweet that shared the same message.To the politicians who have abandoned their civic obligations, I say this: Have some courage.

"February 24, 2016","Republican National Committee chairman and anthropomorphic weasel person, Reince Priebus, joined CNN for an interview where he tried to convince Alisyn Camerota that the RNC was  in control  of Trump and Republican voters. To say it was not convincing would be an understatement.Priebus actually thinks that the rest of America doesn t hear his entire party railing about how bad Trump is, and how his Fascistic platform will be the doom of the GOP. Priebus responded: I embrace all of these candidates There folks are competing to join us. They are competing to join the Republican Party as our nominee depending on what the delegates decide to do or who wins the requisite amount of delegates. In Cleveland, we re going to vote on the floor for who that nominee is.  That nominee joins the Republican Party. That s what s happening.Priebus actually seems to think that trump is going to come to him, kiss his ring, and request his permission to be the nominee. While I can t read Trump s mind, I would bet hard cash that will never happen.Camerota pointed out that there is a huge amount of the Republican establishment that has been railing against Trump, and planning what are essentially anti-Trump firewalls to halt his juggernaut-like campaign and popularity. But you re making it sound simpler than, in fact, it is. Because as we have heard time and again over the past few weeks, there is a whole chunk of the Republican establishment that is not embracing Donald Trump. In fact, they re rejecting him. We have heard about all of the big donors, all of the Republican Party elders, all of the people in Congress who are basically saying anyone but Trump. Camerota piled on more, reading an editorial from the Washington Post that was critical of Priebus and his apparent cowardice to stand up to Trump and his hate-fueled campaign. The reaction from Priebus was simply priceless. I ve heard comebacks from 13-year-old schoolboys that were better.The best part of it, though, is watching Priebus have to try to respond to the attacks calling him a powerless leader without also insulting Trump. It would be painful to watch him tie himself in knots like this, except for the fact he s a Republican.

"February 24, 2017","As Donald Trump has turned his presidency into an all out war against the mainstream media, the media is finding heroes in strange places   namely Fox News, without whose propaganda we likely would never had had even a candidate Trump let alone the new occupant of the White House.Last week, after Trump s disastrous press conference in which he attacked the media, and especially CNN, Fox s Shep Smith had an eight minute rant defending the media and calling out Trump for his lies. Listen to it if you haven t already. It s amazing.A week has passed and Trump hasn t let up on the media. On Friday, he went so far as to call the media the  enemy of the people,  and he vowed to do something about it.  That s beyond dangerous. It s dictator 101.Oh, but it got worse on Friday a lot worse. The White House, in an unprecedented move, banned several news outlets from the briefing room.Shortly after Mr Trump s speech on Friday, a number of selected media organisations were invited into Mr Spicer s office for an informal briefing, or  gaggle .Those allowed into the room included ABC, Fox News, Breitbart News, Reuters and the Washington Times.When asked why some were excluded, Mr Spicer said it was his decision to  expand the pool  of reporters.He also warned the White House was going to  aggressively push back  at  false narratives  in the news.Politico, Buzzfeed and the Daily Mail were also left out, but CNN was the only major US television network to be denied entry.Source: BBCSmith is not happy. He once again called out Trump and this time, told him exactly what  fake news  means.For the report,  fake news  refers to stories that are created by entities pretended to be news organizations and based on nothing of substance. Fake news is made up nonsense delivered for financial gain. CNN s reporting was not fake news. Its journalistics followed the same standards that other organizations, including Fox News, adhere. Senior administration officials regularly speak without attribution so that the public needs to be informed of what our government is doing off the record.Source: MediaiteHere s the video: Even other Fox personalities were upset with the ban:Some at CNN & NYT stood w/FOX News when the Obama admin attacked us & tried 2 exclude us-a WH gaggle should be open to all credentialed orgs https://t.co/8Vjcs0KCPR  Bret Baier (@BretBaier) February 24, 2017IF true that @SeanSpicer & #WH are banning certain disfavored news organizations All must refuse to play along.

Voting for these people, voting against Donald Trump at this point, is really treason to your heritage,  Duke said on the David Duke Radio Program. BuzzFeed News first reported the comments. I m not saying I endorse everything about Trump. In fact, I haven t formally endorsed him. But I do support his candidacy, and I support voting for him as a strategic action. I hope he does everything we hope he will do. Duke also told his fellow white supremacists that they need to go out and volunteer for Trump, noting: And I am telling you that it is your job now to get active. Get off your duff. Get off your rear end that s getting fatter and fatter for many of you everyday on your chairs. When this show s over, go out, call the Republican Party, but call Donald Trump s headquarters, volunteer. Trump has consistently appealed to bigotry in his campaign. He first launched his effort by calling Mexicans rapists, then proceeded to advocate for registering Muslims and barring them from entering the United States.

"February 25, 2017","Immigration officials in Florida proved how out of control things are in Trump s America by detaining the son of Muhammad Ali because his name happens to sound too Muslim for their liking.Muhammad Ali Jr. and his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, were on their way home after speaking at a Black History Month event in Montego Bay, Jamaica. On Feb. 7, they flew into Fort Lauderdale, Florida. And then things took a disturbing turn.Chris Mancini, a lawyer and friend of the family says they were pulled to the side as they were going through customs. Khalilah Camacho-Ali was released when she pulled out a photo of her with the legendary boxer, but Muhammad Ali Jr. didn t have such a photo. Apparently, being related to a famous person would have meant more to officials than the fact that he s an American citizen with a U.S. passport to prove it.Ali Jr. was held by immigration officials and questioned for almost two hours. Where did you get your name from?  they asked him over and over. When they asked him if he was a Muslim, he said yes, and that really set off alarm bells for officials. They continued to question him about his religion and repeatedly asked him where he was born. Just for the record, he was born in Philadelphia in 1971.USA Today reports:While Ali Jr. was detained, Camacho-Ali ran around the airport asking,  Where s my son?  and begging for help, according to Mancini. Because incidents involving customs officials are considered to be on federal soil, local police had no jurisdiction to help her. Ali Jr. was eventually released two hours later, and the family contacted Mancini the following day.They have both traveled all over the world and never, ever, have they been subjected to this kind of treatment, said Mancini.  To the Ali family, it s crystal clear that this is directly linked to Mr. Trump s efforts to ban Muslims from the United States,  he added. Imagine walking into an airport and being asked about your religion,  he said.  This is classic customs profiling. According to Mancini, the Ali family is debating whether or not to file a federal lawsuit and are searching for others who have been subjected to this kind of racial profiling and harassment.Featured image via Andrew H.

I killed three and I saved 3,000   3,000 babies or more,  said Robert Lewis Dear Jr., referencing abortions conducted at the clinic.Dear s shooting spree followed the release of several videos deceptively edited to make it seem as if workers at Planned Parenthood clinics were breaking the law and selling fetal body parts. Those videos were created by activists at the group Center for Medical Progress and their leader David Daleiden, who was recently indicted in Texas for tampering with government records and other charges.Despite this, attacks on Planned Parenthood have become a part of the Republican mainstream. Presidential candidates have said they would defund the organization to varying degrees, citing the hoax videos as evidence.Meanwhile congressional committees have previously and continue to harass and attack Planned Parenthood but have been unable to point to any crimes that haven committed.Similarly, numerous state attorney generals   including Republicans   have investigated Planned Parenthood but have been completely unable to bring up evidence of crimes on their behalf.The attacks have continued, even after Dear s murder spree.

"February 26, 2017","Donald Trump s botched Yemen raid left 30 civilians   including an 8-year-old American girl and other women and children   dead, as well as a Navy SEAL. Trump has been largely silent about the death of William  Ryan  Owens, and with good reason: it was his negligence that caused it.An 11-year-old child was the first to be struck by a bullet after he heard a commotion outside. Many more children as young as three months old would lose their lives in the bloodbath that was Trump s first military operation. Trump, in his haste to approve the operation over dinner without adequate  intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations  according to military officials, failed to kill his primary target. All that we have to show from the botched mission are a few training videos the Trump administration touted as evidence of their success. The videos have been available on YouTube for a decade.The mission was so poorly-executed that Yemen withdrew permission for the United States to conduct anti-terrorism ground operations within its borders   because Trump can not be trusted.And for what was effectively an attempt for The Donald to boost his fragile ego, Owens lost his life.Since the failed mission, the Trump administration has been using the slain SEAL to silence detractors, indicating that any opposition to the failed operation was somehow an assault on Owens himself   and his father has spoken out to tell Trump where he can stick that line of rhetoric. Don t hide behind my son s death to prevent an investigation. I want an investigation.   The government owes my son an investigation. The elder Owens says that when he heard Trump was coming to  pay respects  to his son   a clear attempt to politicize the death his terrible decision making caused   he was not pleased. The Miami Herald reports: I told them I didn t want to make a scene about it, but my conscience wouldn t let me talk to him,  Owens said Friday, speaking out for the first time in an interview with the Miami Herald.Owens, also a military veteran, was troubled by Trump s harsh treatment of a Gold Star family during his presidential campaign. Now Owens was a Gold Star parent, and he said he had deep reservations about the way the decision was made to launch what would be his son s last mission.Ryan and as many as 29 civilians were killed Jan. 28 in the anti-terrorism mission in Yemen. What was intended as a lightning raid to grab cellphones, laptops and other information about terrorists turned into a nearly hour-long firefight in which  everything went wrong,  according to U.S. military officials who spoke to the New York Times.Bill Owens said he was assured that his son, who was shot, was killed early in the fight. It was the first military counter-terrorist operation approved by the new president, who signed the go-ahead Jan. 26   six days into his term. Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasn t even barely a week into his administration? Why? For two years prior, there were no boots on the ground in Yemen   everything was missiles and drones   because there was not a target worth one American life. Now, all of a sudden we had to make this grand display? I d like some answers about all the things that happened in the timeline that led up to it. I know what the timeline is, and it bothers me a lot,  Owens says. One aspect in particular is that Donald Trump signed his Muslim ban the day before the raid. As Yemen was one of the affected countries, he wonders if it may have affected friendly forces who were assisting with the raid: It just doesn t make any sense to do something to antagonize an ally when you re going to conduct a mission in that country. Did we alienate some of the people working with them, translators or support people. Maybe they decided to release information to jeopardize the mission. Owens says he has no political agenda; he just wants the truth   as do the rest of us.Featured image via screengrab", Trump PANICKING As Father Of Slain SEAL Demands Investigation Into His Botched Yemen Raid

"February 27, 2017","On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer responded to the concerns of the father of the Navy SEAL who died in Trump s disastrous raid in Yemen by blaming him for his own death   but he claimed it was worth it because we recovered valuable intelligence that will save American lives and prevent terrorist attacks. I can tell him on behalf of the President, his son died a hero and the information that he was able to help obtain through that raid is going to save American lives; it s going to protect our country more,  Spicer said, adding that Ryan Owens was responsible for his own death: It s something that as a SEAL and as somebody who deployed 12 times, he knew that this was part of the job and he knew what he was doing. It is almost certain that Owens knew that there was risk involved in his job, but he also relies on the Commander-in-Chief to know what he11-year-old boy is doing. The raid killed 30 civilians (and half as many militants), including about 10 women and children   according to witnesses, an was the first to be struck by a bullet   and completely failed to kill al Qaeda leader Qassim Al-Rimi, who took to mocking The Donald in propaganda videos after the embarrassment that was the Yemen raid. Our forces ultimately recovered a few videos that have been available on YouTube for a decade. Trump s first military operation was such a massive disaster that Yemen revoked the United States  permission to conduct ground-based anti-terrorism operations within the country s borders. Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasn t even barely a week into [President Trump s] administration?  Bill Owens, the father of the slain SEAL, said of the raid.  For two years prior   everything was missiles and drones (in Yemen) .Now all of a sudden we had to make this grand display? Why such a grand display? Because this is what  success  looks like in Trump s America, of course!Despite Spicer and Trump s numerous claims that the mission was hugely successful, senior military officials tell NBC that they are unaware of any  actionable intelligence  that was recovered during the raid: We gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil,  said Spicer.A Defense Department official also pushed back Monday afternoon, saying the raid has yielded  a significant amount  of intelligence.But the only example the military has provided turned out to be an old bomb-making video that was of no current value.On Monday, Spicer addressed the remarks of Bill Owens, whose son died. I can tell him that on behalf of the president, his son died a hero and the information that he was able to help obtain through that raid, as I said before, is going to save American lives,  he said.  The mission was successful in helping prevent a future attack or attacks on this nation. Multiple senior officials told NBC News they have not seen evidence to support that claim.It s one thing to authorize a mission with insufficient intelligence or support. It s another to lie to the family of someone your negligence killed and call it a  success. Ryan Owens was a hero   but his country failed him. His President failed him. And someone must answer for it.Featured image via Getty Images/Drew Angerer"," Military Officials: Trump LIED, Botched Yemen Raid Yielded No Significant Intelligence At All"
"February 28, 2016","In an powerful moment for a night that is usually designated to honoring celebrities and movies, Vice President Joe Biden took to the stage at the 88th Annual Academy Awards to deliver a message about sexual assault.Biden recently took a break from organizing a national initiative to cure cancer to help launch a program that asks young people to fight against sexual assault by standing up and intervening if they see a situation  where consent cannot or has not been given. Taking the microphone at the Academy Awards ceremony, Biden was greeted with a standing ovation from the attendees. The applause was so intense, in fact, that Biden had to settle people down with a joke, telling the collected group of megastars,  I m the least qualified man here tonight. Joe Biden introduces Lady Gaga at the #Oscars. https://t.co/aRmjqBSbjg  MTV News (@MTVNews) February 29, 2016During his brief remarks, Biden made it clear that victim-blaming had no place in our society. Let s change the culture so that no abused woman or man ever feels they have to ask themselves  What did I do?  They did nothing wrong. The vice president was joined by Lady Gaga, who helped make a documentary on the subject of date-rape on college campuses. The two promoted a website called ItsOnUs.org that will help spread the message of what people can do to help stop sexual assaults in universities around the country. Afterwards, Lady Gaga performed a song she had written for the documentary. At the conclusion, she was joined by survivors of sexual assault.

"February 28, 2017","Penguin Random House announced on Tuesday night that Barack and Michelle Obama have both signed book deals with the publisher. According to the statement, the former president and former first lady will each be authoring a book in the near future.The announcement reads: Penguin Random House is pleased to announce that it will publish forthcoming books by former President of the United States Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama. Oenguin Random House CEO MArkus Dohle announced today that the company has acquired world publication rights for two books, to be written by President and Mrs. Obama respectively. The statement did not disclose an actual dollar amount for these deals, but according to a report in Financial Times, bids on their books had reached more than $60 million. If accurate, this would blow away the price tag attached to the memoirs of other recent presidents. Bill Clinton got $15 million for his book My Life and George W Bush made approximately $10 million from his book Decision Points.The announcement did say that  in support of the mission of The Obama Foundation and Penguin Random House s own commitment to social responsibility, the company will donate one million books in the Obama family s name to First Book. The First Book program strives to  promote equal access to education by providing new books, learning materials, and other essentials to children in need. In addition,  the Obamas also plan to donate a significant portion of their author proceeds to charity. We are absolutely thrilled to continue our publishing partnership with President and Mrs. Obama,  Dohle said.  With their words and their leadership, they changed the world, and every day, with the books we publish at Penguin Random House, we strive to do the same. Now, we are very much looking forward to working together with President and Mrs. Obama to make each of their books global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance. This is not the first time the former president has worked with the publisher. CNN points out that Penguin Random House has published Obama s past books,  so the new deal continues a two-decade-long relationship. The hefty figures quoted in the bids for their books clearly demonstrate the expectation that these books are going to be huge best sellers. Personally, I have only one question: Where can I place a pre-order?New books by @BarackObama and @MichelleObama have been acquired by @penguinrandom, the publisher says. pic.twitter.com/EkF5cfRaOH  Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) February 28, 2017Featured image via Mike Theiler-Pool/Getty Images", Publisher Announces Books By The Obamas Are Officially On The Way
"February 29, 2016","When looking at any Donald Trump event lately, it can almost be guaranteed that there will be some sort of protest. With his vitriolic and racist rhetoric, he s bound to have at least a few people stand up and say something. Now, with Trump getting closer and closer to being the clear Republican nominee, these protests are becoming even more frequent. And Trump always makes sure any dissenting voice is removed, because god forbid anyone disagree with what he has to say.In an effort to remove these protesters as fast and as peacefully as possible, the Trump campaign has been playing this announcement before every event: This is a peaceful rally. In order to notify the law enforcement officers of the location of the protester, please hold a rally sign over your head and start chanting,  Trump. Trump. Trump.  Ask the people around you to do likewise til the officer removes the protester. Thank you for helping us make America great again. Now, if you re like me and thought,  no way, that can t be real, that has to be a voice over, because it s just too goddamn creepy.  Well, upon further research, it is, in fact, true. According to NBC News, as of a couple of months ago, Trump began running this announcement at the beginning of his rallies. Attendees were instructed ahead of the event to not harm the protesters, an announcement that is becoming more frequent at the start of Trump s events.Audience members followed those rules as far as could be seen, cheering  Trump  and  U-S-A  until the interrupters were escorted out by event security and law enforcement. So, it seems this announcement is not only very real, but it is why we hear the  Trump! Trump! USA!  chants at every rally surrounding a protester using their freedom of speech to openly dissent.Check out the extraordinarily bizarre announcement here:An announcement before Trump s rally on how his supporters should deal with protestors. pic.twitter.com/WT4NqSbGI2  Vic Berger IV (@VicBergerIV) February 29, 2016Featured image: Flickr", Check Out CREEPY Announcement Made Before Trump Rallies For Dealing With Protesters (VIDEO)
"February 3, 2016","Many women have had enough of men in power telling them what they should or should not do with  their bodies. One would think that in 2016, it would be understood by presidential candidates that a woman simply has a right to her own body and the choices she makes are hers and hers alone.Not so with the current Republican clowns running for president. For some irrational reason, all the  candidates seem to believe that they have a right to tell women what to do with their bodies. A group of women decided to get together and teach the candidates a lesson by posing the following question: What would it be like for men in power to get schooled on what they should or shouldn t do with their bodies? The results in the video are effective as well as hilarious.The results in the video are effective as well as hilarious.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdXZd7VZTnI]One woman speaks directly to the camera and says: Guys, Republicans, picture this: Once a month, lots of blood just comes out of you d**k hole and if you want to prevent it, you just shove a tampon in your d**k hole. Now picture my trying to regulate your d**k hole. Another woman on screen continues with some advice for Donald Trump. She says:  Take as many selfies as possible. You ve got the duck lips that teen girls dream of. And there were some suggestions for lowly Jeb Bush: You basically want women to wear a chastity belt. We just want you to use your actual belt and wear your pants below your nipple line. By subverting power and reversing it, these women teach these candidates an important lesson. Although it s doubtful that someone like Donald Trump, who has said terrible and sexist things about women will heed the message and reverse course. It s also doubtful that someone like Ben Carson, who believes that abortion should be outlawed, even in cases of rape and incest, will heed the message as well. However, the hope is that Americans will be rational enough not to vote for a Republican for the presidency when the time comes.Featured image via video screenshot", Watch Women Reverse Roles And Tell Male Republican Candidates What They Should Do With Their Bodies (VIDEO)
"February 3, 2017","Earlier in the week, there were leaked draft executive orders circulating that would strike President Obama s executive order protections for LGBTQ federal workers. There were also rumors that Donald Trump would sign a sweeping, broadly worded  religious freedom  bill into law that would effectively legalize discrimination nationwide. However, Trump and his famously homophobic vice president, Mike Pence, ran into a road block: Trump s kids. Specifically, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump.Jared and Ivanka have long been seen to be the reasonable, moderating influences that are needed to calm Trump s impulsive, erratic temperament. It appears that this is what happened here. Ivanka and Jared see all of the fear and the protests in the streets against Trump, and they feared that there would be even more national and international backlash against Trump s bigotry via executive order. Therefore, there was a complete reversal on these orders.Of course, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer outright lied when asked about it. He insisted that these orders were just a couple out of hundreds that were being considered. Then, of course, a statement was hastily rushed out, saying that the Trump administration is  determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community. Considering all of the virulently anti-LGBTQ people Trump has around him   namely Mike Pence   I don t believe that for so much as a second. If Ivanka and Jared can keep Trump s hands away from the LGBTQ community for the time being, though, all the better. Hopefully it will hold until 2018, and we manage to take Congress back, thus crippling the amount of damage Trump and Pence can do until they are out of office.While their reasons were political rather than noble, at this point, it s better than nothing.Featured image via Aaron P.

They claim that BOA and the Chicago Public School system made a number of unwise financial investments that the teachers and students have been deeply hurt by. WGN reports:  CPS says it needs the bond money for existing debt payments to cover construction and repair projects.This all comes after the union rejected a contract proposal that would have required members to pay more toward their pension and health care.The district then announced it would slash $75 million from school budgets.According to a Chicago Tribune poll, three times as many Chicagoans side with the teacher s union versus Mayor Rahm Emanuel on how to improve public schools.The survey also found that Emanuel s approval rating on education has fallen to a record low as it has with his overall job performance and handling of crime in the city. #CTU #faircontractnow Sit in started at Bank of America building   Photos from inside @Sarah4Justice @CTULocal1 pic.twitter.com/LFxm8rP4wm  Bill Chambers (@Chgofenian) February 4, 2016Protesters filled the streets, causing traffic on the Loop to slow to a crawl.

We know our work is not finished, and we are committed to building a mutually respectful relationship with the CTU and working at the bargaining table around the clock so Chicago children can remain in the classroom. In the meantime, because of our dire financial circumstances, we must proceed forward with painful cuts in the absence of an agreement. We are hopeful we can rescind these cuts by swiftly reaching an agreement. It looks like the Emanuel administration will be embroiled in just as much controversy this year as it was in 2015.

Yet   you d think the arguments presented would be somewhat in line with what that candidate s own thoughts were in the past. Not so in this case.Jeb Bush is trying to say Marco Rubio is  inexperienced,  but when confronted on why he recommended Senator Rubio to be Romney s Vice Presidential choice back in 2012, Bush became visibly flabbergasted.Here was the exchange between him and Fox News Bret Baier:Bret: Well, (Rubio) had enough experience that you recommended him for Vice President when Mitt Romney was looking.Jeb: Yeah, except he doesn t have the experience to make a tough decision.Bret: But, why recommend him for Vice President then if he didn t have the experience back then?Jeb: Because he would have earned it.What does that even mean? Look   it s obvious Jeb is trying to wiggle his way out of this one, and on that front he failed, big time.For some more context on this, here was what Jeb said back when Romney was still mulling over his options for VP: Look   he has more experience than Barack Obama had when he ran. And the practical experience   he s certainly got the intelligent acumen and fortitude to be a good president and I have a special place in my heart for him. It s hard to describe the pride I have for his incredible success and how he has moved in to the job of being a U.S. senator with humility, not trying to be an arrogant guy, to learn the trade if you will. And people in Washington really admire him. Those are some very kind words. Not only that, but Bush even went further in another interview with Newsmax in April of 2012, when he said Rubio was  probably the best choice  out of every potential candidate.

"February 5, 2017","Even though alleged president Donald Trump s executive order banning seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. has caused widespread panic, he told Fox News host Bill O Reilly on Sunday that the move was going  smoothly.  Trump s fake news  facts failed to mention that his poorly worded order sent the world into chaos.When O Reilly asked the man-baby POTUS how the travel ban worked out following the executive order, Trump said,  I think it was very smooth. You had 109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers and all we did was vet those people very, very carefully. Actually, that s not true and we re sure you re shocked. 60,000 visas were revoked following his Muslim ban.Press Secretary Sean Spicer also echoed Trump s claims previously that only 109 people were affected by his travel ban on the seven Muslim countries even though that claim was disproved.Facts matter:While DHS estimates suggest that around 375 travelers who were in transit were stranded or detained, thousands of refugees were put into limbo when Trump scuttled the U.S. refugee program.During the jaw-dropping interview in which even a Fox News host challenged him, Trump insisted multiple times that the executive order was implemented in a  smooth  fashion and only 109 people were affected.In that same interview, Trump was asked by the Fox News host why he respects Vladimir Putin. O Reilly said,  He s a killer  and the host was not lying. Still yet, Trump said,  There are a lot of killers. You think our country s so innocent? Watch:President Trump Bannon also said he s against sanctuary cities.From there, Trump went into the same dangerous territory his team keeps venturing into. He wants to prove he won the popular vote, but he s doing so without proof.

"February 6, 2017","Earlier today, Trump said to a crowd at MacDill Air Force Base that the  very dishonest media  wasn t reporting on the terror attacks that are happening all across Europe all the time. Later on, the media pressed Sean Spicer on that topic while aboard Air Force One, and Spicer s response was to say that they d provide a list  later on.  Well, that list is out, and surprise surprise, it s completely ridiculous.Since Trump s comments focused on Europe and, by extension, the U.S., the following lists are focused there, despite many, many other attacks happening around the world.Perhaps one of the most ridiculous things about the White House s list of attacks is that it includes high-profile attacks that were covered for days on end, such as the 2015 attack against Charlie Hebdo in Paris, and the fateful attack at a Paris club in November. It also includes two foiled attacks that were also widely reported. Broken down:They also list several attacks in France in 2016 that were covered extensively.Then they list an attack in London in December 2015 that was covered by CNN, Reuters, The Huffington Post, USA Today, and more.There s one in Copenhagen, Denmark in February of 2015 that was covered by CNN, The New York Times, USA Today, The Huffington Post, Reuters, and more.Most of us probably remember the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, which was covered by CNN, NPR, The New York Times, CBS News, NBC News, USA Today, ABC News, and more.But that s Europe. What about the attacks they list here in the U.S. that supposedly weren t covered, or weren t covered extensively enough? Like the following:Really? So far we ve looked closely at 18 of the attacks listed, and they were all widely covered by U.S. media. Trump and his minions insist that we re not covering attacks in Europe hardly at all, and then they provide a list with 30 attacks that are in the Middle East, parts of Asia, and in Indonesia and the Philippines.Those attacks are terrible and tragic, too, but again, Trump didn t say anything about us not covering attacks in those regions. He probably didn t even think about those regions until whoever it was that compiled that list gave it to him (if they gave it to him).But the biggest falsehood is that the media isn t reporting, or is underreporting, on these attacks. It s like they hurriedly compiled a list of terror attacks worldwide from Wikipedia and couldn t be bothered to proofread, let alone research. There are spelling errors in addition to the lie that the media covers up attacks.

"February 7, 2017","You know how white supremacists have been calling Trump their  God-Emperor?

Are you arguing then that the president s decision in that regard is unreviewable?  Judge Michelle T. Friedland asked Flentje at one point in the Trump administration s attempt to get the Muslim ban back up and running. To most, the idea of any leader having unlimited and absolute power in any area of the government is frightening, but to the Trump administration it s just the way things should be.Flentje hesitated briefly, then provided a single-word answer that reveals everything you need to know about the mindset of Trump and his team of white supremacists, Christofascists, and other Deplorables:  Yes.

"February 8, 2016","It is extremely important to vet the people we put in charge of our children    especially in positions of power. Apparently, a Chowchilla, California school, along with the local police department, failed to do so when it came to school resource officer Timothy Hormel.Hormel is currently on administrative leave because of allegations that he had sex with a minor. The 35-year-old cop was arrested by the Mandera County Sheriff s office after the accusations surfaced. As per usual, the police department is conducting an internal investigations in the Hormel s allegedly criminal actions. According the Sheriff s department, the minor was not a student at any school Hormel was assigned to.What makes this all so frustrating is that a predator like that never should have been anywhere around school children, especially not in a position of power. There s a reason there are age of consent laws: children do not have the mental and psychological capacity to consent to sex with adults. Further, Hormel could have used his power as an officer of the law to coerce the sex, if it did indeed happen.Either way, this guy needs to go to jail if he did this, and that Sheriff s department and local school system need to be investigated.Watch a video news report below, via ABC 30:Featured image from video screen capture", CA School Resource Officer Arrested For Having Sex With A Minor (VIDEO)

"February 9, 2016","Saudi Arabia, that bastion of human rights, is at the center of a controversy on Twitter. To be more specific, a Starbucks in Saudi Arabia is getting the attention. That s because their stores have segregated entrances for men and women.Stories about the barbaric treatment women and other political minorities face in Saudi Arabia are nothing new. However, the oppression they face does not usually receive a publicly stated golden seal of approval from a major U.S. company.One Starbucks located in Jabir is currently undergoing remodeling. They have segregated entrances and seating for women and families. The wall that separates the two sides came down during the remodel. So they decided to just outright ban women from entering the cafe. One woman encountered this sign while trying to get her caffeine fix.

Starbucks in Saudi Arabia refused to serve women. Note on their door, plus official response from company. pic.twitter.com/d4tCSqqQOv  Muhammad Lila (@MuhammadLila) February 3, 2016It gets so much worse.Starbucks responded to the situation. They released a press statement, which says the following: At Starbucks, we adhere to the local customs of Saudi Arabia by providing separate entrances for families as well as single people. In addition, all our stores provide equal amenities, service, menu, and seating for men, women, and families. Starbucks, whoever came up with  we adhere to the local customs of Saudi Arabia  needs to be paid more. They managed to make Starbuck s support of incredibly sexist laws against women sound like the company is doing nothing more than trying to be a culturally sensitive 21st-century global corporation.What other local customs of rich ISIS does (Saudi Arabia really does not like it when you compare them to ISIS) Starbucks adhere too? If an atheist like Raef Badawi,  threatened  Islam by saying what they believe in one of their 78 locations in Saudi Arabia, would they be fine with it if they person was sentenced to death?  The official statement said  customs  which leaves a lot of room for such questions.I could go on and on dissecting the lengthy statement put out by Starbucks. The mental gymnastics that went into making the company sound as if they are actually supporting women s rights is astounding. However, I think this might be the most egregious part: We are pleased to share that the store is now accessible to single men on one side as well as women and families on the other side. Starbucks has now 78 stores in Saudi Arabia and all stores cater to both families and singles, except for one that is exclusively reserved for women and families. They re  pleased  to inform people everything is back to normal because their cafes are all now 100% segregated again.If you recall, Starbucks attempted to profit from the wholesale slaughter of people of color last year, by way of their infamous #RaceTogether marketing campaign. After all, one marginalized group s oppression is another empowered group s opportunity. For some f#cking reason, Starbucks urged customers to talk to their baristas about racism.Here s an idea, what if every one of Starbucks  customers started asking baristas about how incredibly messed up Starbucks  overseas business practices are? We can make it a campaign and call it something like #HoldTheSexism or #PatriarchyTogether.

Trump didn t just quietly let her go, though. He accused her of betraying her department, and implied that she d betrayed the U.S.Now, enter Eric Holder. He was Obama s attorney general before Loretta Lynch, and spearheaded Department of Justice investigations into controversial things, such as whether the police department in Ferguson, Missouri was guilty of racial profiling, among other things.

"Jan 1, 2016","We can t afford to give our US Veterans a proper funeral, but we ve got money to burn when it comes to bringing Muslim refugees to the US from countries who hate us. On average, each Middle Eastern refugee resettled in the United States costs an estimated $64,370 in the first five years, or $257,481 per household. When a veteran or member of the armed forces dies, he or she is entitled to a ceremony that includes the presentation of a U.S. flag to a family member and a bugler blowing Taps. Most of the time, there is a three-volley rifle salute if requested by family members. But now, if the deceased served in the Air Force, the three-volley salute is not an option because the Air Force can no longer support riflemen for funeral services for veteran retirees.Seven member services for retirees included six members to serve as pall-bearers, a six member flag-folding detail, and a three riflemen to fire the salute. Veteran s funerals now only receive the services of two-member teams, who provide a flag-folding ceremony, the playing of taps, and the presentation of the flag to the next of kin. To me, without the 21-gun salute, it just does not make it complete a proper military burial,  veteran Wayne Wakeman told Honolulu s KHON 2 News.  I think because of sequestration or the lack of funds or whatever excuse they re giving, that they had to hit the veterans. Wakeman is correct in supposing the cut is due to sequestration, the 2013 automatic federal spending cuts required by the Budget Control Act of 2011.Rose Richeson, from the Secretary of the Air Force s Public Affairs Press Desk, told We Are The Mighty the policy of restricting the funeral honor is an Air Force-wide requirement. The requirement is consistent with DoD policy which require a minimum of two personnel,  Richeson said.  Any number of personnel above two that is provided in support of military funeral honors is based on local resources available.

"Jan 10, 2016","Hillary Clinton s new e-mail release exposes her relationship to some very anti-Israel people. Sydney Blumenthal is a very close friend of the Clintons and exchanges quite a few e-mails with Clinton that are disturbing. Did he have much influence of foreign policy and the inner workings of the State Department. While Clinton claims Blumenthal was a minor character, the e-mails reveal a different story entirely:As Hillary Clinton s email scandals goes  nuclear  with more and more classified material coming to light (including some described as  explosive ), one disturbing trend is coming to light: Hillary s deep contempt for the state of Israel in general, and Prime Minister Netanyahu in particular.When the State Department released more than 5000 pages of Clinton s emails from her private server on New Year s Eve, it included correspondence with her one-time advisor Sidney Blumenthal. The communications revealed an exchange regarding Israel, and Blumenthal cited the work of his son, journalist Max Blumenthal, a self-described  anti-Zionist  known for his radical anti-Israel views.According to the Times of Israel,  In March 2010, Blumenthal plugged his son s work   this time, playing up links between evangelical Pastor John Hagee and Netanyahu   in the context of an article (written by a different writer) discussing a controversial Pentagon briefing on U.S. relations with Israel and the Arab world.   The briefing had dealt with the lack of progress in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and American concerns over a growing perception among Arab leaders that the US was incapable of standing up to Israel. The senior Blumenthal sent several articles written by his son and referenced the younger man s plans to move to Israel for several months to write a book.  He tracks a lot of things that do not appear in the mainstream press,  he wrote to Hillary.Just in time for the 2016 election, hear Hillary Clinton say she would NOT run for president, in  Hillary Unhinged  by Thomas KuiperHillary then took the articles in question and instructed a staffer to print five copies  without the heading from Sid.  She noted the articles came from Max Blumenthal s book  Goliath: Life and Loathing in Greater Israel,  a widely criticized and rabidly anti-Semitic volume that castigated Israeli policies. The Nation s media editor Eric Alterman referred to it as the  I Hate Israel handbook  and wrote Blumenthal s  case against the Jewish state is so carelessly constructed, it will likely alienate anyone but the most fanatical anti-Zionist extremists, and hence do nothing to advance the interests of the occupation s victims. According to the Times of Israel,  Blumenthal also sent Clinton a piece by leftist Israeli Uri Avnery, who also analyzed the Pentagon briefing by leveling a damning critique against Netanyahu. Clinton asked Blumenthal, in response, how she should use this material in an upcoming talk she was supposed to have with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Blumenthal speculated on Netanyahu s psychological makeup by suggesting his actions were motivated by a desperate attempt to live up to his father s expectations.In an email sent immediately after the May 2010 Israeli raid on the Gaza-bound Turkish ship Mavi Maramara in which nine activists were killed, Blumenthal referred to the operation as  Bibi s Entebbe in reverse.  Noting that Netanyahu s brother Yoni was  heroically killed  in the 1976 hostage rescue mission, he said the brothers  father Benzion  adored  Yoni, while the younger Benjamin has always lived in his brother s shadow.  Bibi desperately seeks his father s approbation and can never equal his dead brother (he) has never measured up,  Blumenthal suggested.The senior Blumenthal continued to push his son s anti-Israel views on Hillary. As noted by the Times of Israel,  In 2012, Blumenthal sent his son s article in al-Akhbar,  The Bibi Connection,  to Clinton, who then relayed it onward. The article emphasized Netanyahu s intent to campaign against Obama s reelection in 2012, arguing that  Netanyahu s shadow campaign is intended to be a factor in defeating Obama and electing a Republican in his place.    The article reflected upon Netanyahu s ties to prominent Republicans such as Newt Gingrich, as well as the prime minister s right-wing pedigree. It noted that when his father, Benzion Netanyahu,  returned to Israel to launch a political career, the elder Netanyahu was rejected by Menachem Begin, the (then-)Likud Party leader, who, as right wing as he was, considered him dangerously extreme. Hillary offered a  terse  response on some of Sidney Blumenthal s policy suggestions regarding Israel, upon which he backed off. However,  Blumenthal could not keep Netanyahu out of his semi-retraction, hinting at missed peace opportunities by the Israeli leader:  Of course, if Bibi were to have engaged Syria in negotiations taking its previous gestures seriously   he wrote, before changing the subject without concluding the hypothetical. The email dump revealed Blumenthal was not the only one commenting on Middle East policy. Foreign-policy analyst Anne-Marie Slaughter, formerly the State Department s director of policy planning, wrote to Clinton the  time was right  for the U.S. to recognize Palestine during the emerging of the Arab Spring. It would allow you and POTUS to have accomplished the goal POTUS laid out at UNGA last year and would make it much harder for Syrians, Iranians, even Saudis to use this issue to divert domestic opposition, strengthening the seismic shift across the region to create fault-lines around reform/no reform instead of Arabs/US-Israel,  wrote Slaughter.The Times of Israel notes,  The emails also indicate the existence of a lengthy correspondence over attempts to reconcile Israel and Turkey following the events of the 2010 Gaza flotilla, but the emails are so heavily redacted as to expunge any clue as to what was actually discussed.   Another series details attempts in 2010 to broker direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with significant input from the parties involved in the Arab Peace Initiative.

"Jan 11, 2016","Something about this decision really stinks of favoritism and cronyism. We d love to know who made the decision to punish the American viewers with yet ANOTHER painful appearance by John Kasich on the debate stage over Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul Rand Paul and Carly Fiorina have been booted to the undercard in Thursday night s Republican primary debate as the number of main-stage candidates was cut to seven by stricter polling criteria.Paul, who is struggling to gain traction in the presidential race, immediately cried foul, and vowed to not participate in the event.Fox Business Network, which will televise the sixth GOP presidential debate this week, announced the debate fields on Monday evening, after weeks of speculation that Paul would for the first time not make the cut for the primetime event. The seven candidates who will appear on the main stage in North Charleston, S.C., are Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich. Kasich qualified as a result of his strength in New Hampshire. Paul and Fiorina are set to join Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum in the undercard   if Paul decides to participate. The Kentucky senator told CNN Monday evening, just before the official announcement, that Fox Business had made  a mistake,  and he wouldn t attend. We will not participate in anything that s not first-tier,  Paul said. His campaign confirmed to POLITICO that he will sit out Thursday s debate.His campaign elaborated in a statement that multiple polls showed him well within the network s criteria for qualifying, and contended that the margins of error in polls make them a poor tool for determining who makes the main stage. To exclude candidates on faulty analysis is to disenfranchise the voter,  the statement said.  Creating  tiers  based on electoral results of real votes might make sense but creating  tiers  on bad science is irresponsible. Regardless of whether he takes part in the undercard debate, the downgrade could be a crippling blow for Paul   who has insisted that he would remain in the race through the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, even though he also faces a reelection campaign this year for his Senate seat.In an interview with POLITICO last week, Paul called for organizers to abolish the earlier undercard debate.  I m not sure what the purpose is anymore, if there ever was one,  Paul said. The Paul camp has fought hard to keep its candidate on the main stage, where he has appeared for the prior five debates. Earlier Monday, the campaign released a memo stating that  multiple national polls  have the Kentucky senator  in 5th or 6th place    even though he s in seventh place in the average nationally and in both early states.  By any reasonable criteria Senator Paul has a top-tier campaign and has qualified for the stage,  the memo said.But it was clear that Paul didn t meet the criteria Fox Business had outlined prior to Monday s qualification deadline. The network said it would average the five most recent polls nationally, and in both Iowa and New Hampshire. The top six candidates nationally would qualify   and if any other candidate appeared in the top five in either early state, they would be added.Paul was in seventh place nationally and in both early states, according to POLITICO s calculations.Fox Business outlined specifically which polls were used in a subsequent statement to reporters, saying the outlet used  the most recent national and state polls from non-partisan, nationally-recognized organizations using standard methodological techniques.

"Jan 12, 2016","If Rubio isn t smart enough to see that Trump s catapult to the top of the GOP contenders happened the moment he took a strong stand against politicians putting illegal aliens before Americans, then is he really smart enough to run our nation? And maybe even more importantly, if Rubio does recognize the majority of voters across the board want to elect a President who will stop the invasion of illegal aliens into our country, who is he planning to represent if he were to get the nomination?Sen. [score]Marco Rubio[/score] (R-FL) is doubling down on his support for in-state tuition for illegal aliens.On ABC, George Stephanopoulos asked Rubio about his work in the Florida statehouse in which he  co-sponsored legislation to provide in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants.  Stephanopolous asked Rubio directly:  Do you stand behind that position now? Rubio said that he  absolutely  stands behind that legislation:RUBIO: It was a very narrowly drafted bill. You had to have a certain GPA, you had to live in the U.S. a long time, you had to graduate from a Florida high school. It was very narrowly tailored to high-performing students who found themselves in a situation where they were brought here by their parents when they were 5, didn t even speak another language except English and therefore couldn t attend college because they were being charged like they were from out of state. They still had to pay for college but they paid for what people paid when they lived in Florida. They had to be high school graduates of Florida.STEPHANOPOULOS: So you stand behind that?RUBIO: Yes, of a narrowly tailored bill like that, absolutely.In theory, this legislation means that an American student wishing to attend a Florida state university, who is from the neighboring state of Georgia, would have to pay higher tuition costs than an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, who has been living unlawfully in Florida and attending American public schools for the past thirteen years on the taxpayer dime. Illegal aliens are also eligible for generous child tax credits, a benefit protected in the Gang of Eight bill. Indeed, the  taxes  requirement in the Gang of Eight bill would have meant illegal aliens could receive tax payments in the form of free cash from the IRS, since poor illegal aliens have no tax liability.Rubio s plan to discount college tuition for illegal aliens will serve as a further magnet to new illegal immigration, and will also increase competition for college slots and post-college jobs for American youth who are already struggling. Moreover, due to affirmative action policies, these illegal aliens will not have their tuition discounted but their applications given preferential treatment as well.By contrast, front-runner Donald Trump told NBC s Chuck Todd that same day that he opposes Rubio s legislation to give illegal aliens taxpayer-funded tuition discounts.TODD: Senator Rubio sponsored a bill back in Florida (back when he was in the State House) to give in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. There s a lot of states that allow in-state tuition for the children of undocumented immigrants. I ve not heard your position on that.TRUMP: I m opposed to it.TODD: Totally opposed?TRUMP: They re here. They re not here legally. I m opposed to itTODD: Even kids born to illegal immigrants?It is perhaps interesting to note that Chuck Todd seems a bit confused about U.S. immigration policy illegal alien tuition discounts are for foreign-born youth who are themselves illegal immigrants. Under current policy, the US-born children are automatic birthright citizens, meaning no legislation is required to make them eligible for all the benefits enjoyed by Americans. Indeed, illegal immigrants primarily access welfare programs through their U.S.-born children. As a September 2015 report from the Center for Immigration Studies noted,  analysis shows that legal immigrant households make extensive use of most welfare programs, while illegal immigrant households primarily benefit from food programs and Medicaid through their U.S.-born children. Regardless, Trump made clear in the interview he would ensure that neither illegal alien youth (DREAMers) or birthright citizenship children, would be eligible for such benefits. Trump made clear he would move to eliminate birthright citizenship so that the US-born children of illegal aliens would no longer made automatic citizens. Again, by contrast, Rubio supports birthright citizenship a position which is supported by only 20% of Republicans according to the most recent Rasmussen Reports immigration survey issued on December 27, 2015.Rubio s Sunday endorsement of discount college tuition for the foreign-born illegal alien youth is in keeping with his longstanding support for DREAM amnesty proposals, which have been a passion of Gang of Eight co-member [score]Dick Durbin[/score].While Rubio briefly distanced himself of his support for DREAMer amnesty in 2010 in order to get elected to the U.S. Senate and indeed attacked attacked his opponent [score]Charlie Crist[/score] specifically for his support of the DREAM Act upon arriving in the U.S. Senate, Rubio quickly used his new position of power to begin working on a plan to legalize so-called DREAMers. In 2012, Rubio wrote: They re not in compliance with immigration law, and, thus, not American citizens. But they are culturally as American as anyone else s children Rubio s statement might be news to Laura Wilkerson whose 18-year-old son, Joshua, was gruesomely murdered by his DREAMer classmate. In her Congressional testimony last summer, Wilkerson told lawmakers how her son was,  beaten, strangled, tortured until he died. He was tied up, thrown in a field, and set on fire  [During his trial], we had to hear this kid on the stand muttering about,  In my country   In my country  never to finish that sentence. We listened to him tell us repeatedly that his  killing skills took over .  Wilkerson told lawmakers,  You cannot you cannot stand by and ignore our families   our American families. You re elected by Americans, not any other country. You should be for Americans. Yet Rubio remains so committed to amnesty for illegal immigrants who allegedly entered as minors that he has said he will not immediately revoke President Obama s lawless 2012 executive amnesty for DREAMers. In a Spanish-language interview with Jorge Ramos, Rubio said:  Well, DACA is going to have to end at some point. I wouldn t undo it immediately. The reason is that there are already people who have that permission, who are working, who are studying, and I don t think it would be fair to cancel it suddenly. But I do think it is going to have to end. And, God willing, it s going to end because immigration reform is going to pass. Rejected-Majority Leader [score]Eric Cantor[/score] similarly supported Rubio s efforts to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. Cantor declared,  One of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents.  This prompted Cantor s then-primary challenger Rep. [score]Dave Brat[/score] (R-VA) to describe Cantor s declaration as  one of the most radical pro-amnesty statements ever delivered by a sitting representative.

"Jan 12, 2017","We don t know whether the charges against Fiat Chrysler by Obama s EPA are accurate or not. One thing we do know however, is that much like the announcement today that Obama s DOJ will be going after FBI Director James Comey,  the timing of this announcement by Obama s EPA is certainly suspicious. Only 4 days ago Fiat Chrysler US confirmed the next phase of its industrialization plan by announcing a total $1 billion investment in plants in Michigan and Ohio, and the addition of 2,000 new American jobs. Consistent and combined with previously announced investments, FCA US is further demonstrating its commitment to strengthening its U.S. manufacturing base, and aligning U.S. capacity to extend the Jeep  product lineup. In total, FCA US has committed investments of more than $9.6 billion in its U.S. manufacturing facilities and created 25,000 new jobs to date since 2009.Many were giving Trump credit for creating a more business, and specifically manufacturing friendly environment that seems to be created a tsunami of good news in the way of US manufacturing. The only down side, is that it s shining a pretty big spotlight on the failures of our current over-regulating, punitive administration that has made it almost if not entirely impossible to compete with other countries to manufacture here, in the US. With all the egg Obama and his regime seem to be getting on their faces over the past couple of months, is it really all that surprising that the EPA would make an announcement that would harm Fiat-Chrysler sales and their reputation on the way out the door? Detroit CBSlocal   Fiat Chrysler is denying government charges that some of its diesel vehicles violate federal clean air standards.CEO of Fiat Chrysler Sergio Marchionne saying the allegations are a surprise to him   calling it  absolute nonsense,  reports WWJ AutoBeat Reporter Jeff Gilbert. There was never any intent   of creating conditions that were designed to defeat the testing process,  he says.The comparison to the issues VW is facing regarding deceptive emissions testing is one Marchionne refuses to make.  Anyone who draws a parallel between us and VW   is smoking illegal material. The way in which it has been described I think is unfair to us and that s the thing that bothers me most. The U.S. government is accusing Fiat Chrysler of failing to disclose software in some of its pickups and SUVs with diesel engines that allows them to emit more pollution than allowed under the Clean Air Act.EPA Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles saying emissions software on those vehicles were not disclosed.  Those software elements   not being disclosed in Fiat Chrysler s required application for certification means that the vehicles were sold illegally. The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday it had issued a  notice of violation  to the company that covers about 104,000 vehicles including the 2014 through 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram pickups, all with 3-liter diesel engines. The California Air Resources Board took similar action.Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that its emissions control systems  meet the applicable requirements. The company said it was disappointed with the EPA s action and intends to work with the incoming Trump administration to present its case. Fiat Chrysler said it spent months giving information to the EPA to explain its emissions technology and proposed a number of actions including software changes to address the agency s concerns.Fiat Chrysler s shares fell more than 16 percent after the news was announced to $9.29.If the company is found guilty of this charge they could face huge penalties.Marchionne says the company will work with the new administration to show they are compliant with all EPA standardsBut of course Like a puppy that s been left home alone to run around the home all day, someone s gonna have a lot of cleaning up to do once the Chicago contingent moves out of DC ","IS OBAMA PUNISHING Fiat-Chrysler For 2,000 US Jobs, $1 Billion US Investment Announcement?

Don t you think America is owed an explanation as to why this scumbag was able to meet with Obama following his speech a couple days ago in Omaha? A University of Nebraska-Omaha university professor who used a December 28 Facebook tirade to say  F**k the law,   F**k police,  and  F**k the NRA  was allowed to meet President Obama after his January 13 speech in Omaha.The professor s name is Amanda Gailey. She is also the director of Nebraskans Against Gun Violence.Here is Gailey s Facebook rant in it s entirety:F**k the society that has allowed itself to become so saturated in guns that it s plausible a child might have one at a park. F**k the laws that allow toy makers to make toys that look like real guns and that allow gun makers to make guns that look like toys. F**k racists who think black children look like adults. F**k a legal and police system that allows grown white men to pose with sniper rifles on a university campus or in a grocery store and allows insurrectionists to train guns on government agents with no consequences but sounds the alarms when a black child is carrying a toy gun. F**k police officers who undertook a job that carries inherent risk but think any perceived threat to them whatsoever justifies instantaneous lethal force. F**k police officers who pull up as close as possible to an alleged threat so that they can execute the person as quickly as possible without assessing the situation first. F**k prosecutors who can indict a ham sandwich but can t indict a cop who executed a child. And f**k the NRA for greasing this machine every fucking day with the blood of American children.On January 14 weeks after the original post was put up Gailey put up another post in which she attempted to explain that her criticism of police was limited to  bad-apple officers,  not good ones. And she was specifically outraged by the fact that the no charges were filed against officers who shot 195 pound, 12-year-old Tamir Rice after a 911 dispatcher told officers  a young man [was] playing with a weapon and pointing it at people outside of a local recreation center. Gailey wrote:I did write a Facebook post that expressed my outrage at the police shooting of a 12-year-old child and the failure to indict the bad-apple police officers involved. My criticism of the police was limited to those officers who engage in that kind of policing, which I believe is clear in my post. I did not malign the police in general, nor did I want to, because I respect the many good officers who serve our communities and have even helped me in the past. I know that most police officers are doing hard work in hard conditions, and they are in the front lines of a society saturated in guns, facing threats that police in our peer nations do not. They are key players in our struggle for safe and fair communities.This is Gailey s explanation for  F**k the police  as well as  F**k the society,   F**k the laws,  and  F**k the NRA,  among other things.

Within seconds we were tossed around and they took stones from a gravel bed on the corner and threw them at us,  said Elisa.A police car appeared at the train station as the stoning attack unfolded and arrested the men.The German media as a general rule do not disclose the last names of victims to protect their privacy. The three men are between 16 and 18 years-old and are known to the authorities from theft and assault arrests.Dortmund police official Kim-Ben Freigang said the suspects told the police that  such persons must be stoned. Yasmine installed a security camera at the residence where she lives with Elisa after the attacks.  That was barbaric what they did. They are barbarians,  Yasmine said.She added that she could not believe that such an act of shamelessness occurred.  In 2016, in Germany, with stoning!

"Jan 17, 2016","This is a mind-blowing interview that confirms much of what many of us suspected about the Clintons. For some, it may be even worse than what they believed to be true. Kudos to Linda Tripp for agreeing to do this interview. People who cross the Clinton s do usually fare too well In a rare interview, Linda Tripp, a pivotal figure in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, revealed on Sunday it was common knowledge while she worked in the West Wing that Bill Clinton had affairs with  thousands of women. Speaking on  Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,  Tripp for the first time divulged that she personally knew another White House staffer aside from Lewinsky who was also having an affair with Clinton. That unnamed staffer was mentioned by Tripp in various depositions but she has not spoken about it publicly.She charged that Hillary Clinton not only knew about her husband s exploits,  She made it her personal mission to disseminate information and destroy the women with whom he dallied. Tripp says she cringes at the sight of Clinton presenting herself as  a champion of women s rights worldwide in a global fashion, and yet all of the women she has destroyed over the years to ensure her political viability continues is sickening to me. Tripp documented evidence of Lewinsky s phone calls about her relationship with Bill Clinton and submitted the evidence to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, leading to the public disclosure of the affair. She explained to Klein that she did so because she believed her own life and Lewinsky s were in danger, saying that Lewinsky was threatening Clinton with outing the relationship.Tripp also used the interview to criticize what she says is the news media s unwillingness to investigate the Clintons. She singled out and thanked Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report, declaring that without him  things would have been very, very different. Drudge s website was the first media outlet to break the Lewinsky scandal after Newsweek sat on the story.Tripp had unique access to the Clintons because her office was directly adjacent to Hillary s second floor West Wing office for the entire time she served in the Clinton White House from 1993 to the summer of 1994 with the exception of the first three months of the Clinton administration, when she sat just outside the Oval Office.Tripp s nonpartisan position was a carryover from the George H. W. Bush administration in which she served. Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made She told Klein that her role in the Lewinsky case followed  years of alarm at what I had seen in the Clinton White House, particularly Hillary and the different scandals, whether it was Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater, Vince Foster. All of the scandals that had come before and were so completely obliterated in the mind s eye of the American people because of the way all of them were essentially discounted. So I watched a lying President and a lying First Lady present falsehoods to the American people. So my dismay predated the January 1998 period when the Monica Lewinsky scandal surfaced. To me it was very important that the American people see what I was seeing. My years with the Clintons were so disturbing on so many levels. Tripp maintains that she went public with the Lewinsky evidence to ensure the intern s safety as well as her own.She told Klein:I say today and I will continue to say that I believe Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made and action I took. That may sound melodramatic to your listeners. I can only say that from my perspective I believe that she and I at the time were in danger, because nothing stands in the way of these people achieving their political ends.I think that had it not become public when it did, particularly in light of the Paula Jones lawsuit, which was coming to a head with President Clinton s deposition, that we may well have met with an accident. It s a situation where unless you lived it as I did you would have no real framework of reference for this sort of situation.Tripp said the young Lewinsky, 21-years-old when she entered the White House as an intern, was unaware of the danger that she faced.She described Lewinsky as a  young girl, smart, clever   but in this one area she was blinded and she fancied herself in love. He fancied himself entitled. It was nothing more than a servicing agreement. She romanticized that there was an affair. And when it didn t pan out the way she had hoped it would   he had promised her he would bring her back to the White House as soon as the 1996 election campaign had finished. When he didn t, she essentially lost her mind and started acting in erratic and frightening ways. Threatening the president.There came a point in July of 1997 when she not only threatened to expose the affair, as she referred to it. But also she at that time informed him that I knew all about it. So at that time it became dangerous for Monica and for me. This was something that absolutely could never see the light of day. And she never realized the implications of threatening a president or her behavior. And I did.Tripp told Klein that  the biggest fallacy that most people believed is that this was a unique occurrence. Monica was somehow special. And regrettably that s the farthest thing from the truth. She said,  Everyone knew within the West Wing, particularly those who spent years with him, of the thousands of women. Now most of your listeners might find that difficult if not impossible to believe. And I can tell you in the beginning I felt the same way. But let me be clear here. This is a pattern of behavior that has gone on for years. And the abuse of women for years. Asked whether Clinton was having affairs with others in the West Wing, Tripp replied,  I know that to be true. One in particular who I will not name told me this herself. But as to the hundreds or thousands, remember I worked closely with the closest aides to the president. And it was a loosey-goosy environment so there was not a lot of holding back. So it was common knowledge, let s put it this way, within the West Wing that he had this problem. It was further common knowledge that Hillary was aware of it. Tripp described the tense West Wing atmosphere between what she characterized as two almost diametrically opposed Clinton camps.The dynamic between the two groups   the Bill Clinton people and the Hillary Clinton people. It was as though they were almost opposing forces. But I can tell you that the one with the power and the one that instilled the fear in the other was the Hillary camp.And the [Bill] Clinton people would cower if she were coming into the area, just as an example, of the Oval without notice. There would be scurrying around to make sure there was no one in the wrong place at the wrong time, shall we say. It was a fascination to see the amount of energy that was expended covering up his behavior. It was horrifying.Tripp said Hillary personally targeted Bill s female conquests and accusers, with the future presidential candidate exhibiting behavior that is  egregious and it s so disingenuous. In my case, for instance, right after the Lewinsky story broke, she was heard directing her staff to get anything and everything on Linda Tripp. So the defamation of character and the absolute assurance that my credibility would be destroyed began right away. And it happens with any woman who is involved in any way, either with him in a physical relationship or an assault or anything that can endanger their political viability.Tripp recalled Hillary s January 27, 1998 appearance on NBC s The Today Show in which she was seen as standing by her husband while blaming the Lewinsky scandal on a  vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president. She didn t do it in an honest way,  said Tripp of Clinton s NBC interview.  Instead she lied, which didn t surprise me. And I will give her credit. She is enormously effective. And became a victim. A wife who was betrayed. This is someone who had no real personal problem with any of this behavior. The problem was in it becoming public. They had to continue to become electable  She was the more aggressive one in ensuring that the political viability was not endangered in any way. Tripp told Klein that Hillary  does not possess integrity on any level. I just wish that your listeners could know the person that I knew. Because if they did there is not a chance she would be elected president. Tripp s ringside seat afforded her rare insight into the scandals of the 1990s and perhaps alleged wrongdoings to come, with the West Wing employee personally witnessing behavior that may have foreshadowed Clinton s email scandal, in which she is accused of sending classified materials through her personal server.Tripp said she noticed major differences in the manner in which classified material was handled by both the Clinton and Bush administrations in which she served.President George H.W. Bush s administration had  a completely different way of operating on every level, including on classified and secret material,  she said.She continued:All the regulations were followed, right down to a cover sheet being essential if the document had had any sort of classifications. The securing of classified documentation in safes. The burn bags that were used if any sensitive material was to be disposed of. All of this was familiar to me and followed every security protocol that I had experienced in the past.When the Clintons came in this was one of the things that I found appalling right from day one. And it went hand and hand with the disdain for the military. The military was present in the White House in the form of presidential aides. The aide that carried the nuclear football, just as an example. And in the Bush White House they were respected, as they should be. In the Clinton White House, they were disdained. To see it treated this way and to see these people treated this way was disturbing.Tripp referred to Clinton s private mail woes as  classic Hillary Clinton in a nutshell. She gets to decide what she does. Look, the rules don t apply to the Clintons. If you understand that basic premise you understand the Clintons. For Tripp, Clinton s use of a private server was  all about control. She has a need to control every single aspect of her life. And you know anyone in government knows that any key stroke on a keyboard within a government agency belongs to the government  it is not up to the employee on any level to control what happens to it for posterity.

"Jan 18, 2016","It s good to know there are a few Hollywood celebrities who haven t bought into Obama s false messiah B.S During an appearance before the U.K. s House of Lords on Tuesday, Hollywood actress and human rights advocate Angelina Jolie spoke out about how Islamic State group militants use sexual violence as a means to perpetuate terrorism   and about how we need strong leadership (unlike that of President Barack Obama) to overcome this threat.Jolie s excoriating speech laid bare just how anemic and pitiful Obama s response to ISIS has been, and how ISIS is being allowed to build a society based on rape, violence, and of course Shariah law. They are dictating it as policy beyond what we have seen before,  Jolie said.  They are saying,  We should do this, this is the right way to build a society, so we tell you to rape. Islamic militants are basically building a civilization not focused on growing food or educating children, but rather on kidnapping, enslaving and raping women, to perpetuate the endless cycle of terrorism, and Obama has allowed these barbaric radical Muslims to thrive. The most aggressive terrorist group in the world today knows what we know, knows that it is a very effective weapon and they are using it as a centrepoint of their terror and their way of destroying communities and families, and attacking and dehumanising,  Jolie explained. For over 10 years, I had been visiting the field and meeting families and survivors of sexual violence who felt for so long that their voices simply didn t mater, they weren t heard, and they carried a great shame,  Jolie continued.She added that we need  a very, very strong response at this time  to stop this horrific behavior. Of course, we have been calling on Obama to make that strong response for years, but he s far more interested in race baiting back home than dealing a death blow to radical Islam.Jolie does have some measure of expertise in the matters she s speaking of. As she told the Houses of Parliament, she has been campaigning for Middle Eastern victims of sexual abuse for over a decade (H/T The Gateway Pundit).Below is an excerpt of Jolie s address, this part dealing with some of her encounters with young rape victims.https://youtu.be/KBmHnzjgwSkIt seems like Jolie is someone whose words President Obama should heed.

"Jan 20, 2016","Legendary singer and great patriot Charlie Daniels has been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration in the past but THIS is the best ever overview of the drip, drip, drip of Muslim refugees coming to every town in the U.S: If what happened in Cologne and other cities in Germany on New Years Eve, when young Muslim men insulted, groped, robbed and raped German women who were on the street celebrating the holiday doesn t wake Germany up, they are in for a long and probably irreversible ride.Angela Merkel s reckless act of allowing one million refugees into the country may seem like a great humanitarian gesture to some, but as the ramifications of such a foolish move begin to reach street level, Germany will be in for a long, national nightmare.The grotesque acts that occurred on New Year s Eve were not isolated incidents, but happened nationwide with the earmarks of single intentioned flash mobs operating in numbers too large to control and overtaxing the law enforcement personnel available to deal with it.Some of the ones who were detained told police that they couldn t do anything to them, that they had been invited into Germany by Ms. Merkel, as if that was a license to harass and abuse the girls without consequences.A million people from another culture, who practice another religion, who have no regard for women s rights and who believe that Western Society is decadent, who refuse to assimilate and don t believe they are bound by the laws of the host country, is a lot to turn loose on any society at one time, and New Year s Eve was just a small harbinger of things to come. Even if the troublemakers represent just 2 percent of the population of refugees, that is still approximately 20,000 people that can cause a lot of problems for Germany.This is before the terrorist component has made itself known. Merkel, in her rush to out politically correct other world leaders has imported the agents of death into her country. The genie is out of the bottle, and German children will suffer the ramifications of Angela Merkel s folly for generations to come. In rejecting a 200,000 limit on the number of refugees entering the country, it seems Merkel plans to allow even more refugees in 2016.It s too late for Germany. They have opened the zoo, and lions walk among them. Soon the terror attacks will begin, and the Muslim population explosion will, in relatively few years, create a significant voting block that will grow exponentially. Unlike native Germans who abort millions of their unborn each year, most Muslims don t practice abortion, and their tradition of having multiple children per family only accelerates the process.And once again, we are beaten over the head with the truth that  not all Muslims are terrorists,  but it doesn t take a majority to be dangerous.It s not too late for America, despite the fact that Obama seems determined to expose our society to the same dangers that Germany faces.This president has a weak spot for things Muslim. Whether it s his father s heritage, his upbringing, his education at an Indonesian madrassa or a combination of all of the above, I just don t know. It s apparent every time he talks about the  holy Koran  or the  Prophet  with such reverence, and it also reveals itself in his insistence that Islam has absolutely nothing to do with terrorism.He got taken to the cleaners by the Mullahs in Iran, who actually did little besides promise not to develop a nuclear device for 15 years, and since their word has all the value of a Zimbabwean penny, nobody but Obama believes they ll honor the terms of his incredibly weak deal   a deal that unfreezes billions of dollars which Iran will no doubt use to continue funding terror.In fact, Iran may have already violated the treaty by taking United States sailors, whose boats reportedly drifted into Iranian waters, into custody and subjecting them to humiliation, even broadcasting it on television all over the Islamic world to show how impotent the  Great Satan  really is.By the time they freed our sailors, they had pulled off a public relations coup farther emphasizing their disrespect and their opinion of just how weak, ineffective and disengaged they consider Obama to be.All of this doesn t seem to bother Obama though. He is determined to turn over one hundred and fifty billion dollars to this bunch of loose cannons, and he seems bent on bringing in thousands (tip of Obama s iceberg) of Muslim refugees, when we have already been told that ISIS has infiltrated operatives into the numbers.I believe that the only thing that protects America from further insults and aggression from Putin, China and anybody else who has an ax to grind with us is the grace of God and the fact that our enemies are afraid that America may elect a president with some backbone and the courage and guts to protect our interests.While there is a whole world out there that respects only power and those willing to use it, Obama extended a limp olive branch, which has been snatched out of his hand and is being used to beat him with.Never send a boy to do a man s job.What do you think?Pray for our troops and the peace of JerusalemGod Bless AmericaCharlie DanielsCharlie Daniels is a legendary American singer, song writer, guitarist, and fiddler famous for his contributions to country and southern rock music.

On Sunday, agents caught a group of seven illegal aliens near the river and when they took them to the station for processing learned that one of them identified as Walter Leonel Vasquez Zacarias was a violent sexual predator, court records obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed.Court records revealed that Vasquez Zacarias had been convicted of  aggravated sexual battery victim under 13 years of age  in March 20, 2009. For that offense, Vasquez was initially arrested on June 16, 2008 in Augusta County, Virginia and after his conviction was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but for unknown reasons, eight years from his sentence were suspended and he was deported in March 30, 2010 through Houston.Vasquez continues to be listed in various search engines as a violent sexual predator.In recent days, agents arrested four other criminal aliens with a sexually based criminal history, information provided to Breitbart Texas by Border Patrol revealed. One of the aliens was from Guatemala and he had a previous conviction for aggravated sexual battery of a victim under the age of 13. Another of the aliens was also from Guatemala and he had a conviction for aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

Denmark is a major pork producer and it is the most popular meat, but it is forbidden to Muslims and Jews. Most of the asylum-seekers who have arrived in the country in the past months are Muslim.Noergaard, a member of the anti-immigration, populist Danish People s Party that proposed the council motion, said Thursday that it wasn t meant as a  harassment of Muslims,  but added that he had received  several complaints about too many concessions  being made to Muslims in the small, predominantly Lutheran country. The signal we want to send here is that if you re a Muslim and you plan to come to Randers, don t expect you can impose eating habits on others. Pork here is on an equal footing with other food,  Noergaard told The Associated Press. He said that halal meat, vegetarian dishes and diets for diabetics would still be available.In 2013, then-Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt lashed out at some nurseries after they started serving halal-butchered meat instead of pork because Muslim children had refused to eat it.

Despite his previous pronouncements that Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has no chance at the GOP nomination, Pataki conceded that his prediction isn t borne out by reality.

"Jan 25, 2016","You seriously can t make this up. This Democrat run city is officially out of control. We reported before that the EPA knew about this crisis long before they told anyone, yet the media and the Left continues to try to pin the blame squarely on Michigan s Republican Governor. This latest threat is just another  black eye  for the officials handling the Flint, MI water crisis As the water crisis in Flint deepens, it is becoming apparent that the effects of the lead-infested water are not just a health hazard, but the situation has the potential of ruining many more lives outside of the poison issue. There is no denying that the water in Flint is undrinkable and that it is contaminated with lead and other substances, and it is clear that the government of Flint is responsible for the problem.However, the city s government continues to charge people for the poison water and then threatening to foreclose their home or take their children if they refuse to pay. Michigan law states that parents are neglectful if they do not have running water in their home, and if they chose not to pay for water they can t drink anyway, then they could be guilty of child endangerment.Activists in Flint say that some residents have already received similar threats from the government if they refuse to pay their bills.Flint residents have recently filed two class action lawsuits calling for all water bills since April of 2014 to be considered null and void because of the fact that the water was poisonous. We are seeking for the court to declare that all the bills that have been issued for usage of water invalid because the water has not been fit for its intended purpose,  said Trachelle Young, one of the attorneys bringing the lawsuit, in court. Essentially, the residents have been getting billed for water that they cannot use. Because of that, we do not feel that is a fair way to treat the residents,  Young added.Recent estimates have indicated that it could take up to 15 years and over $60 million to fix the problem, and the residents will be essentially forced to live there until the problem is solved. Despite the fact that the issue is obviously the government s responsibility, they have made it illegal for people to sell their homes because of the fact that they are known to carry contaminated water. Meanwhile, residents are still left to purchase bottled water on their own, in addition to paying their water bill.Although this problem is finally getting national media attention in Flint, they aren t the only city with contaminated water supplies. In fact, a recent report published by The Guardian showed that public water supplies across the country were experiencing similar issues.This crisis highlights the many dangers of allowing the government to maintain a monopoly on the water supply and calls attention to the fact that decentralized solutions to water distribution should be a goal that we start working towards.Via: DC Clothesline",FLINT RESIDENTS TOLD TO PAY BILLS FOR POISON WATER Or They May Have Their Children Taken Away

Shouldn t they have addressed how Americans are becoming victims of violence by followers of Islam instead?The Islamic advocate and fashion-blogger invited by Google and Fox to question the GOP s 2016 candidates at the Jan. 28 debate is also a supporter of far-left 2016 candidate, Democrat Sen. [score]Bernie Sanders (I-VT)[/score]Noor, who describes herself as an advocate for Islam, earlier posted a video portraying Adolf Hitler in agreement with Trump.Noor s affiliation with far-left Sanders showcases the post-1960s radical political shift among America s far-left advocacy groups.Before the 1960s, these left-wing groups pushed for Marxist-style economic policies they thought would aid poorer, working-class Americans, regardless of color, by transferring wealth and power from industry and factory-owners.But after the 1960s, the far-left leaders gradually shifted their focus away from economics and towards cultural policies. Under this  cultural Marxism,  progressives believed they would aid racial and sexual minorities   and now Islamic minorities   by transferring cultural power and status from ordinary Americans, especially from white working-class Americans and away from individualistic-minded Christian churches.Many large business groups and very wealthy individuals have welcomed and funded this shift from  Economic Marxism  to  Cultural Marxism. Since then, the left s culture-war against ordinary Americans  long-evolved, equality-promoting and pro-ideal culture has forcibly imposed  diversity  on society, which has divided Americans into angry factions and sharply reduced the pre-1970s political pressure for higher taxes on very wealthy individuals.The shift has also caused the Democratic Party to fight for increased immigration, much to the delight of business groups and Wall Street, who make enormous financial gains from an increased inflow of cheap workers and welfare-supported immigrant customers. Those economic gains flow to many major companies, including Google and Fox, who are producing the Jan. 28 debate.Because of this divide-and-rule diversity strategy, progressive Democrats   including President Barack Obama   are also encouraging the migration of devout Muslims and their theocratic political leaders into the United States.The resulting spike in jihad attacks, the migrants  high use of welfare and the spread of their religious ideology   which stigmatizes woman and sexual minorities and ordinary non-Muslim Americans that are the base of the Democrats  disparate political coalition   and progressives  increasingly shrill contempt for Americans who dislike of Islamic ideology, are just the costly civic side-effects imposed on Americans by progressives  reach for political power and social status.Muslim advocates are useful for progressives because they rally immigrant Muslim voters and they help to spike American social conflicts, which boosts the civic conflict, or  diversity,  that benefits business groups and far-left, secular, anti-Christian, progressive leaders.

"Jan 29, 2016","One of my personal favorite conservative writers, Nick Short has done an amazing job in this piece, where he traces the roots of the Black Lives Matter and cop hating movements to our Divider In Chief. If you re not familiar with his work, Nick Short at politicallyshort.com is worth visiting. His work is supported  by reader donations. If you re so inclined to support him, I m sure he would appreciate it. When the organization known as Black Lives Matter (BLM) was first formed right after George Zimmerman s acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin on July 13, 2013, most overlooked the true intentions of the group beyond their calls for  justice . Fast forward to today and it can no longer be overlooked that their calls for justice now result in retaliatory violence against those whom they believe are the oppressors, namely those being white people in general and police officers specifically. By tracing the origins of the organization back to its philosophical formation in the 1960 s, we can begin to see how BLM is rooted in the radical ideological beliefs espoused by none other than President Barack Obama.Before we get to that point though, it is crucial for us to understand that BLM was founded by three militant feminists by the name of Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opel Tometi. While each played their part in contributing to the creation of the group, Garza is the driving force as she detailed the philosophy behind BLM in her October 2014 article titled A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement. Garza writes the following in regards to BLM s philosophy: Black Lives Matter is a unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes. It goes beyond the narrow nationalism that can be prevalent within some Black communities, which merely call on Black people to love Black, live Black and buy Black, keeping straight cis Black men in the front of the movement while our sisters, queer and trans and disabled folk take up roles in the background or not at all. Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, Black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum. It centers those that have been marginalized within Black liberation movements. It is a tactic to (re)build the Black liberation movement. Alicia Garza explains why she started the Black Lives Matter terror movement. Notice how she ties her hate for law enforcement into her discussion about taking action against anyone who doesn t agree with their radical tactics:The Activist Web: Alicia Garza from Ford Foundation on Vimeo.The key takeaway from Garza s statement is found in the last two sentences primarily as she notes that BLM was created with the intention to  (re)build the Black liberation movement.  The reason this statement is of utter importance is because it ties directly to the idea of Black Liberation theology, which was the doctrine taught to Obama for over twenty years at his church in Chicago made famous by Obama s pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Black Liberation theology was first formed on July 31, 1966. In an article published by NPR it is noted that: Black liberation theology originated on July 31, 1966, when 51 black pastors bought a full page ad in the New York Times and demanded a more aggressive approach to eradicating racism echo[ing] the demands of the black power movement. What is often overlooked in the formation of the group is the linkage between the Nation of Islam and Black Liberation theology as Wright s mentor and founder of Black Liberation theology James Cone credited Malcolm X with  shaking him out of his theological complacency.  Stanley Kurtz of National Review highlighted this synergy in noting that according to Cone,  The black intellectual s goal is to aid in the destruction of America as he knows it.  Such destruction requires both black anger and white guilt. The black-power theologian s goal is to tell the story of American oppression so powerfully and precisely that white men will  tremble, curse, and go mad, because they will be drenched with the filth of their evil , wrote Cone.In an excerpt from Stanley Kurtz s piece drawing on the influence of Malcom X on Black Liberation theology, Kurtz states:So what exactly is  black power ? Echoing Malcolm X, Cone defines it as  complete emancipation of black people from white oppression by whatever means black people deem necessary.  Open, violent rebellion is very much included in  whatever means ; like the radical anti-colonial theorist Frantz Fanon, on whom he sometimes draws, Cone sees violent rebellion as a transformative expression of the humanity of the oppressed Theologically,  Cone affirms,  Malcolm X was not far wrong when he called the white man the devil. The false Christianity of the white-devil oppressor must be replaced.   Couple these words to Obama s pastor Jeremiah Wright s statement that  there will be no peace in America until whites begin to hate their whiteness  and you can begin to understand that the rhetoric behind Black Lives Matter that blames  white privilege  for virtually everything is rooted in Black Liberation theology. However Wright was radicalized , notes Bud White of NoQuarterUSA,  it is clear that he consciously appropriated the language and tenor of the Nation of Islam.  White documents the following:Wright s statement that 9/11 was deserved retribution ( We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans America s chickens are coming home to roost ) is a perfect echo of Malcolm X s statement that  The assassination of Kennedy is a result of that way of life and thinking. The chickens came home to roost.  Although it appears that Wright began his focus on Black Liberation Theology sometime after 1966, his racial attitudes and rhetoric have imitated that of NOI since at least 1970. Wright s blaming the United States for creating AIDS to kill minorities is but just one example of his thinking being in lockstep with NOI. The Nation of Islam and Black Liberation Theology are two doors to the same room. Black Liberation Theology is a  palatable  form of  Christian  black nationalism. The fiery anti-American, race-baiting words of Wright, Cone, and others behind the theology of Black Liberation  are from the same philosophical cauldron as the Nation of Islam , concludes White.From the beliefs that served as Obama s bedrock foundation for his ideology, is it any wonder that today that the radicals behind Black Lives Matter and the Nation of Islam are allowed a free pass to incite as much hatred and retaliation against those they deem are the oppressors? As violence has ramped up in the first half of 2015 in targeted assassinations against police officers, little to no coverage by the media is given to a meeting that was hosted by the White House on December 1st.On December 1, 2014, Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder met with seven Black and Latino organizers   from Ferguson, Mo.; Columbus, Ohio; Miami, Florida; and New York City, who had been leading the ongoing actions to disrupt the status quo. In an article posted by the website FergusonAction, it is explained that during this meeting activists such as Ashley Yates were given the platform by the White House in order to reaffirm their belief that  most violence in our (their) community is coming from the police departments, and something needs to be done about it.  On December 20th  something was done about it  as two uniformed NYPD officers were assassinated in their marked car by Ismaaiyl Brinsley in what Brinsley himself boasted as an act of retaliation for the death of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York at the hands of the police.The reason Yates is emphasized here is because she, like BlackLivesMatter founder Alicia Garza, praise cop killer and former Black Liberation member Assata Shakur as a martyr for their cause. Yates even created T-shirts and hoodies that read  ASSATA TAUGHT ME  in a reference to Shakur that has become part of BLM s iconography. The fact that the president would even entertain the thought of meeting with those like Yates and other  activists  who hold cop killers as icons for their movement further goes to show how Obama s belief in Black Liberation theology, primarily that retaliation and violence should be used to further their cause, has never left him. Why else would Obama have met with these  activists  unless he was sympathetic to their plight, which given the fact that Obama spent over twenty years of his life listening to Jeremiah Wright s sermons, he very much is. Since this meeting though, what cannot be dismissed is the fact that violence in the form of targeted assassinations of both white people and police officers, have ramped up.And it will only get worse the longer we continue to allow Obama s Department of Justice to remain idly complicit.",HOW BLACK LIVES MATTER Terrorists And Cop Killings Can Be Traced Back To Barack Hussein Obama

These  midnight regulations  published after the 2016 presidential election could cost the American taxpayer over $44 billion.California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa re-introduced legislation Tuesday that would allow Congress to overturn executive branch regulations finalized in the last 60 legislative days of an outgoing presidential administration.The bill amends the Congressional Review Act, which would allow Congress to recoup the ability to essentially curb numerous regulations rushed through the regulatory process in the last days of an outgoing administration at one time.Issa s office claims the bill is designed  to stem a growing trend by Presidents, of both parties, to use their last few months in office to rush in costly, expensive or controversial new regulations. The legislation, expected to be approved by the House Wednesday, was already introduced with support from the Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Tom Marino. Regulations impacting the economy, the environment, families, and our community should be done with great caution and transparency, not get rushed in last-minute on a President s way out of office. This is a good piece of legislation that will help keep this and future Presidents in check. The Midnight Rules Relief Act is a reasonable plan to strengthen executive branch oversight, giving Congress a better tool to ensure regulations are limited and, when necessary, approved in an open and transparent manner,  Issa said in a statement.

"Jan 30, 2016","Adding insult to injury is what Obama does best. here he goes again thumbing his nose at America. Not only is he visiting a mosque claiming Americans have been misbehaving bigots (we haven t) but he s visiting a mosque with extremist ties!  There he goes again poking his finger in the eye of America. One thing he hasn t held back on this last year of his presidency is showing his true colors by screwing America. The Baltimore mosque President Obama has chosen as the first U.S.-based mosque to visit during his presidency has deep ties to extremist elements, including to the Muslim Brotherhood.The White House announced on Saturday that Obama will visit the Islamic Society of Baltimore (ISB) on Wednesday. He has visited several mosques overseas as president but has resisted visiting one in the homeland. The purpose of the trip, according to the White House, is to  celebrate the contributions Muslim Americans make to our nation and reaffirm the importance of religious freedom to our way of life. But ISB is a curious choice for Obama s first domestic visit.The mosque is a member of a network of mosques controlled by the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), a Muslim civil rights group named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 2008 Holy Land Foundation terror case. Several executives with that organization were convicted of sending money to aid the terrorist group Hamas.Read more: Daily Caller",OBAMA’S FIRST VISIT TO A U.S. MOSQUE Raises Questions About Its Extremist Ties

Chobani is not traded on the stock market, but is one of the biggest advocates for importing employers to the US from Muslim majority nations to Twin Falls, ID                Chobani CEO Hamdi UlukayaChobani is owned by Turkish Muslim immigrant Hamdi Ulukaya. Chobani has filled 30 percent of its 600 positions at the world s largest Yogurt plant in Twin Falls, Idaho, with refugees resettled in America through a U.S. State Department program carried out in cooperation with the United Nations.Ann Corcoran, author of the Refugee Resettlement Watch blog, said the potential conflict of interest is disturbing and should be questioned by Twin Falls residents. Twin Falls is really a microcosm of what we find going on in so many of the refugee communities across the U.S., where you have people moving in and out of government and the Chamber of Commerce with a vested interest in making sure a meatpacking plant or some other industry has continuous access to refugee labor,  said Corcoran.  Only in this case we have a blatant example of conflicts of interest by an elected official who is also the head of the Chamber enticing companies to come in and make use of the steady influx of cheap, overseas labor. These are jobs that Americans would be happy to fill but they are forced to compete now with someone from Sudan or Iraq who is used to working for a dollar a week. The local Muslim community in Twin Falls grew out of its mosque and built a new, much larger house of worship last year.Here s Chobani CEO s response to Trump s moratorium on refugees from 7 countries:  This is very personal for me,  Ulukaya wrote in internal memo to his staff that was obtained by CNN.  As an immigrant who came to this country looking for opportunity, it s very difficult to think about and imagine what millions of people around the world must be feeling right now. General Electric GE (NYSE) stock was down .87%           CEO Jeff Immelt said, in a memo on the G (GE)employee blog, that he shares the  concern  felt by his employees and said the company has many employees from the countries named in the ban.

"Jan 6, 2016","Because blaming the Muslim migrants who raped and sexually assaulted an untold number of women on New Years Eve would be politically incorrect and certainly not very hospitable A political scandal is developing in Germany as ordinary citizens wake up to the scale of the migrant crime cover-up, and the callous reaction of the mayor of Cologne to mass-sex crime on new year s eve.The Mayor of Cologne has spoken out about the attacks, but her carefully chosen words are unlikely to delight many. Rather than addressing the root causes of the violence   unlimited mass migration and a totally failed system of integration   the newly elected pro-migrant mayor instead blamed the victims of the sexual abuse for having failed to defend themselves against the immigrant attackers.Here is a video of the shocking chaos that took place on New Years Eve:Speaking on live television this afternoon mayor Henriette Reker, who was near-fatally stabbed in the run up to October elections by an anti mass migration campaigner, said in future women would have to be better prepared in her city to deal with migrants.She remarked:  The women and young girls have to be more protected in the future so these things don t happen again. This means, they should go out and have fun, but they need to be better prepared, especially with the Cologne carnival coming up. For this, we will publish online guidelines that these young women can read through to prepare themselves .What form this guidance will take is presently unclear, the mayor could take inspiration from young victim whose modest clothes protected them from the worst consequences of walking at night in areas controlled by migrant men. The woman said:  Fortunately I wore a jacket and trousers. a skirt would probably have been torn away from me .Despite her words of warning towards women in the city they could prepare for more violence against them, she refuted the suggestion there was any link between the attacks and migrants, contradicting her own chief of police.An opposition council member has today sounded the alarm bell on the deteriorating state of control the local government has over the city of Cologne, and in an official letter from the council group has warned those planning to come to the famous Cologne council next month  the city and the police  are unable to guarantee the safety of locals and tourists .Council group leader and lawyer Judith Wolter said in her letter to the people of Cologne today:  I want as a member of the Cologne City Council  to submit a travel warning for the carnival time in Cologne city centre. Especially the area in and around the central station, the cathedral and the adjoining area towards the banks of the Rhine for tourists (and locals) is no longer considered even in normal times as safe. For months, there is in these areas numerous thefts, open drug dealing, robberies and harassment of all kinds  Dozens of women were sexually harassed in public and there was at least one rape. Neither the city nor the police are able to guarantee in the territory described the safety of tourists and locals. Especially for women it must be assumed that a high security risk is here in the evening and night hours. At New Year s Eve there was a legal vacuum and a no-go area for women. With the climax of the Carnival season it is unfortunately expected to be a similar situation .German police have admitted to losing several urban areas to migrant gangs as so-called no-go zones, but this is possibly the first time a public square in the centre of a European city has been acknowledged by officials as having been lost to criminality, and out of the control of police at night.News of the attacks was suppressed for days, with just short reports of isolated incidents in Cologne city centre making it to local outlets on New Year s Day.The Kolnifsche Rundschau described the scene at the railways station as  largely peaceful  and made no effort to describe those who attacked the young women, one of which told press she had  fingers on every orifice  after she was stripped near naked.Only after nearly 100 victims of assault and abuse came forwards to police, and stories of attacks started circulating on social media did the truth of the situation start to slowly emerge, forcing local police to hold a press conference on Monday afternoon.Despite the chief of police admitting the enormous scale of sexual assault and confirming the attackers were of  North African and Arab  origin, much of the mainstream media is still in damage control mode, either trying to shift the focus from migrants, or avoiding the events completely.

"Jan 9, 2016","WOW! This is a powerful, must read letter that should be shared with every American Lately, I must admit that my hostility towards your political ilk has ramped up, pretty dramatically. No, it s not because we, at this point in my life, have a half-black president in the White House, and I m some closet racist who is becoming increasingly frustrated at the prospects of the White Man s power slipping through my fingers. I know that you ve accused our side of such nonsense, and the thought keeps you warm at night, but I can assure you that it is a comfortable fiction of which you should probably divest yourself.Now before I waste too much of your time, let s establish who I m talking to. If you believe that we live in an evil, imperialist nation from its founding, and you believe that it should be  fundamentally transformed , lend me your ears. If you believe that the free market is the source of the vast majority of society s ills and wish to have more government intervention into it, I m talking to you. If you believe that health care is a basic human right and that government should provide it to everyone, you re the guy I m screaming at. If you think minorities cannot possibly survive in this inherently racist country without handouts and government mandated diversity quotas, you re my guy. If you believe that rich people are that way because they ve exploited their workers and acquired wealth on the backs of the poor, keep reading. Pretty much, if you trust government more than your fellow American, this post is for you.First of all, let me say that we probably agree on more things than you think. Even between Tea Party Patriots and Occupy Wall-Streeters, I ve observed a common hatred of the insidious alliance between big business and big government. As Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) so correctly noted, government should never be in the business of picking winners and losers in corporate America, and no person, organization, union, or corporation should have their own key to the back door of our government.Second, contrary to popular belief, conservatives really are concerned with the plight of the poor in this nation. You accuse us of being uncompassionate, hateful, racist, and greedy, but studies have shown that when it comes to charitable giving, conservatives are at least (if not more, depending on the study you read) as generous as liberals in caring for the poor. The difference between us is not in our attitude towards the problem   it s our attitude towards the solution. We believe that the government does practically nothing well (since without competition or a profit motive there is no incentive to do well) and has made the plight of the poor far worse than it would have ever been had government never gotten involved. For a stark example of this, look no farther than the condition of the black family in America since the  War on Poverty  began. You believe that more government is the answer, and that if we only throw more money at the problem, the problem will go away. We believe, as Reagan so aptly stated,Government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem.Third, as people who might actually have to avail ourselves of a doctor s services at some point in our lives, we are just as concerned with the condition of America s healthcare system as you are. While we believe that America has the world s most capable physicians, has the world s most innovative pharmaceutical industry, and is on the cutting edge of medical technology, we also understand that the delivery system is far from perfect. However, unlike you, we see a grave danger in turning the administration of that delivery system over to the same entity that is responsible for giving us the United States Postal Service. There are private sector solutions that should certainly be explored before we kill the system, altogether, by giving it to the government to run.Now that we ve touched on a couple of points of common ground, allow me to explain my aggressiveness towards your efforts to implement your progressive agenda. First, let s talk about the word  progressive , since you now seem to prefer that word to  liberal . In order to label something as progressive or regressive, one must have some idea as to what constitutes progress. What is the ideal towards which you are striving? An idea is considered progressive if it moves us closer to the ideal and regressive if it moves us further away. So, what is your ideal society?Though I can t begin to discern the thoughts of every liberal who may read this, nor can I assume that every liberal has the same notion of an ideal society, in my arguments with liberals over the years, I couldn t help but notice the influence that FDR s Second Bill of Rights has had in shaping the beliefs of the modern liberal with regards to domestic policy. The rights that FDR cited are: The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation; The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation; The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living; The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad; The right of every family to a decent home; The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health; The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment; The right to a good education.At this point, you re probably screaming,  Right on!! , and who can blame you? What sane person in the world doesn t want everyone to be gainfully employed, adequately fed, smartly clothed, appropriately sheltered, and properly educated? These are the goals of every moral society on the planet, however we cannot ignore the fundamental question of,  At what cost? I m not sure whether FDR was a shallow thinker or simply a shrewd, Machiavellian politician, but the fact that he framed each of these ideals as a human right should be troubling to every freedom-loving person in America. After all, what does it mean for something to be a human right? Doesn t it mean that it s something to which you are entitled simply by virtue of your being human? Let s think about some of the basic rights that the real Bill of Rights delineates: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to petition the government, freedom to bear arms, freedom from illegal search and seizure, etc.If you re moderately intelligent and intellectually honest, you ll quickly see what separates the rights laid out in the real Bill of Rights from those laid out in FDR s misguided list   none of the rights listed above require the time, treasure, or talents of another human being.Your right to speak requires nothing from anyone else. Your right to practice your religion requires nothing from any of your fellow citizens. Your right to bear arms means that you are allowed to possess weapons to defend yourself and your family, but it makes no demand that a weapon be provided to you by anyone. A true human right is one that you possess, even if you re the only person on the entire planet   and it is unconditional.FDR s list is no  Bill of Rights . It s a list of demands. If I have a right to a job, doesn t that mean that one must be provided to me? If I have a right to adequate food, clothing, and recreation, doesn t that mean that I am entitled to those things, and someone should provide them to me? If I have an inherent right to a decent home, once again, doesn t that mean it should be provided to me, regardless of my ability to afford one or build one for myself?You might protest that FDR only meant that we have the right to pursue those things, but that s not what he said, and why would he? If we live in a free society, our right to pursue those things is self-evident, is it not? Besides, if he only believed in our right to pursue those things, he would not have felt the need to implement the New Deal.You may be getting anxious, now, wondering what FDR s Second Bill of Rights has to do with my antipathy towards your political philosophy. It s quite simple   your political beliefs are a threat to liberty   not just for me, but for my three boys and their children as well. I care much less about the America that I m living in at this very moment than I do about the one that I m leaving Nathaniel, Charlie, and Jackson.How does your political bent threaten my and my sons personal liberty, you ask? In your irrational attempt to classify things such as clothing, shelter, health care, employment, and income as basic human rights, you are placing a demand upon my time, my treasure, and my talents. If you believe that you have a right to health care, and you are successful in persuading enough shallow thinkers to think as you do, then it will place a demand upon me to provide it to you. If you believe that you have a right to a job, and more than half of America agrees with you, as a business owner, I am obligated to provide one to you, even if it means making my business less profitable.The fact is, you can rail against my conservatism all you wish. You can make fun of my Tea Party gatherings, and you can ridicule patriots in tri-corner hats until you wet yourself from mirth, but one thing is for certain: my political philosophy will NEVER be a threat to your freedom. If you feel a burning responsibility to the poor, conservatism will never prevent you from working 80 hours per week and donating all of your income to charity. If you feel a strong sense of pity for a family who cannot afford health insurance, my political philosophy will never prevent you from purchasing health insurance for this family or raising money to do so, if you cannot afford it, personally. If you are moved with compassion for a family who is homeless, a conservative will never use the police power of government to prevent you from taking that family in to your own home or mobilizing your community to build one for them.However, you cannot say the same for liberalism. If I choose not to give to the poor for whatever reason, you won t simply try to persuade me on the merits of the idea   you will seek to use the government as an instrument of plunder to force me to give to the poor. If we are walking down the street together and we spot a homeless person, using this logic, you would not simply be content with giving him $20 from your own pocket   you would hold a gun to my head and force me to give him $20, as well.Everything that modern liberalism accomplishes is accomplished at the barrel of a government rifle. You do not trust in the generosity of the American people to provide, through private charity, things such as clothing, food, shelter, and health care, so you empower the government to take from them and spend the money on wasteful, inefficient, and inadequate government entitlement programs. You do not trust in the personal responsibility of the average American to wield firearms in defense of themselves and their families, so you seek to empower the government to criminalize the use and possession of firearms by private citizens. Everytime you empower the government, you lose more of your personal liberty   it s an axiomatic truth.What angers me the most about you is the eagerness with which you allow the incremental enslavement to occur. You are the cliched and proverbial frog in the pot who has actually convinced himself that he s discovered a big, silver jacuzzi. Somehow, you re naive enough to believe that one more degree of heat won t really matter that much.I have the utmost respect for a slave who is continuously seeking a path to freedom. What I cannot stomach is a free man who is continuous seeking a path to servitude by willingly trading his freedom for the false sense of security that government will provide.I am reminded of Samuel Adams  impassioned speech where he stated: If ye love wealth (or security) better than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude than the animating contest of freedom,   go from us in peace.

For some, it s Iowa or bust. Carly Fiorina is one of those people.So, with that, it s probably no surprise that Carly Fiorina is doing everything she can to improve her dismal 2% poll numbers.

People aren t going to change their votes simply because you like the same football team as them. At least, we certainly would hope not.We have more faith in the American people than that, even though, quite honestly, it s pretty low now given how people like Donald Trump can lead in the polls (we ll give you that much).

"January 1, 2017","Trump s pick for press secretary, noted numbnut Sean Spicer, appeared on ABC s  This Week  to discuss, well, various things. At one point, he was asked about whether Russia actually did try to rig our election, and he decided to deflect instead of actually give us a real opinion on it. However, his deflection is just plain insane. Despite the fact that Hillary lost the election, he decided to say: We re having part of a conversation. Why aren t we talking about other influences on the election? Why aren t we talking about Hillary Clinton getting debate questions ahead of time? That s a pretty valid attempt to influence an election. Well, first off, she lost, so why is Spicer even bringing this up? Most likely because there s no excuse for Russia meddling in our election, along with the fact that Trump s closeness with Russia looks really bad. It looks so terrible there s no way to make it look pretty without deflecting. So, yeah, sure, Russia s bad, but Hillary s worse, and blah blah blah punish her for it!Yes, Spicer said that, too: When are we going to start talking about the other side of this?

"January 10, 2016","Let s face it, Republicans hate Neil Degrasse Tyson because he is the Obama of science. If the frighteningly intelligent black scientist gets his mitts on their white daughters, they will want to abandon their traditional values and become  ASTROPHYSICISTS.A great example of this is a blatantly racist attack piece put together at the Republican outrage mill Breitbart. In it, the author implies that liberals are racist because they love Tyson. This is followed up immediately by Breitbart using racist tropes of the  lazy black man  to attack him personally while lamenting affirmative action as the only reasons he is on TV.Tyson, whom liberals love because they are racists who can t believe a black guy could be smart enough to be a scientist and so spontaneously ejaculate and soil themselves every time they see him on TV, hasn t published anything of note for years. The advantage of being a celebrity scientist is that you don t actually have to do any science.He didn t get the PhD he was studying for at the University of Texas and had to go elsewhere for his qualification. Obviously, rather than take responsibility for his academic performance, Tyson has blamed racism. In reality, Tyson was playing in bands and appearing on stage instead of completing essays. Typical science PhD students are at any given time either studying, teaching or sleeping.In 2005, he said: I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there s equal opportunity. He of course doesn t address the fact that the only reason Neil deGrasse Tyson is on television at all, given his intellectual shortcomings, is that he is black.Source: BreitbartHere is another famously liberal scientist, who Republicans claim has  intellectual shortcomings,  that is only on tv because of his black skin and a lot of white guilt.image: RedStateQuick fact check. Tyson did not blame his lack of a Ph.D. from UT on racism. He was talking about racism on campus, like when he was stopped 7 times by campus police for walking near the physics building. It s worth noting he was never stopped by campus police walking near the gymnasium. His Ph.D. pursuit ended when the university dissolved his dissertation committee.It took 16 seconds of Google to find that information.Apparently Breitbart is an authority in Astronomy, Physics, and Astrophysics, because they have the ability to sense when a black person has  truly worked hard enough.  in the fields. They also proved their superior authority on the topics mentioned by saying Tyson hasn t published anything of note in years. Tyson has published 13 papers, which is more than Breitbart has done, and last time I checked Breitbart did not do peer-review of any published scientific material.They also hate Tyson because he thinks about something other than Jesus.On this day long ago, a child was born who, by age 30, would transform the world. Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec 25, 1642  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 25, 2014Tyson hasn t published as much work as some others, but there is a context to that. He made a choice to serve the public over himself. Instead of being insulated within the scientific community, he has given up a lot of his legacy in scientific academia in order to bring science to regular people. He went out and made science cool again when Republicans have been trying to make it something to be feared.It s a strange manifestation of birtherism in a way. A black man can t both be smart and popular everywhere except within conservative America.

A new report reveals information from a man who CNN says is a former British spy who is trusted by American intelligence but now does opposition research. On Tuesday, the network reported that a two-page summary had been provided to President Barack Obama and Donald Trump, and Trump is pissed off now that the content has been released in full by Buzzfeed.While it is important to note that the report is not completely verified, the document reveals some information that Trump probably wanted to keep private   like that time he was staying at a hotel in Russia and paid some nice ladies to pee on his bed (not to mention evidence that Trump s campaign worked directly with the Russian government). According to Source D, where s/he had been present, Trump s (perverted) conduct in Moscow included hiring the Presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where he knew President and Mrs Obama (whom he hated) had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a [redacted] show in front of him,  the report reads.Naturally, Trump couldn t handle this  big reveal  and completely flew off the handle on Twitter:This was just too much for the people of Twitter to handle, and they responded perfectly to the puddle Trump had stepped in:@realDonaldTrump you sound pissed.

"January 11, 2016","When major changes happen, it is often difficult to realize they are underway when you re knee deep in day to day life. But when you take a step back and look at things on a larger scale, you can take stock of just how far progress has come.That is the case with a lot of what has been accomplished since President Obama was sworn into office at noon on January 20, 2009. Oddly, conservatives may be able to appreciate this more than the progressives who support Obama and voted for him twice. In their eyes, Obama has been radically remaking America, while progressives may often feel as if things aren t changing enough.Michael Grunwald s piece in Politico Magazine, of all places, goes through the Obama presidency and takes stock of the major changes that this president has engineered, many of which will reverberate through generations.Here are 10 of the things (and there are a LOT more) President Obama did:Grunwald explains further that Obama has not gotten a lot of these innovations   and many more   because he s been more focused on getting them done than taking a victory lap over them. He was determined to make his presidency consequential, as he believed Democrats and progressives had not done all they could to make as many lasting changes as they should have. He paid for some of these efforts through a loss of Congress to the GOP and a drop in his approval rating even as those who disapprove of him have benefitted from the stronger economy and widened safety net.The Obama years have delivered on a huge amount of  change you can believe in.

"January 11, 2017","During Donald Trump s most recent press conference on Wednesday, he mentioned that 96 million Americans were looking for jobs and could not find any. Well, as it turns out, that number is only about 10 times higher than the truth.According to Mr. Trump America has millions of  workers right now in the United States that are   96 million really wanting a job and they can t get. You know that story. The real number   that s the real number. That s incorrect, by quite a bit. Now, maybe if he hadn t repeated that he believed  that s the real number  then he could have recovered from the situation. If he had said 9.6 million, he would have at least been in the right ball park. America does have 96 million people without jobs, but that s including anyone above 16 years of age that is a student, disabled, a stay-at-home parent, retired or not in the workforce for whatever reason, not actively searching for a job.The actual number of Americans that are jobless but actively seek work is only 7.5 million. Add another 2.3 million for  missing workers , those who are unemployed and don t seek work because they don t see much opportunity, that number is 9.8 million workers. So maybe Donald Trump was confused or very misinformed? Either way these numbers are certainly something he should be aware of.Trump is also probably unaware of the fact that the economy is doing great right now, with 15.6 million private sector jobs being added in the last six and a half years thanks to President Obama. However, according to Donald Trump Obama has done nothing good for this country. Is he in denial or just an idiot? Maybe if he went to his intelligence briefings every once in awhile he d know what he was talking about more often.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images", Donald Trump Proves He Knows NOTHING About America’s Workforce
"January 12, 2016","With President Obama s final State of the Union address is receding into history, FactCheck.org has released its presidential report card for January, and the news is mostly positive for the administration. Homicides have dropped 13 percent, but gun sales have surged.  The economy has added more than 9 million jobs, and the jobless rate has dropped to below the historical median.  The number of long-term unemployed Americans has dropped by 614,000 under Obama, but it is still 761,000 higher than at the start of the Great Recession.  Corporate profits are up 166 percent; real weekly wages are up 3.4 percent.  There are 15 million fewer people who lack health insurance.  Wind and solar power have nearly tripled, and now account for more than 5 percent of U.S. electricity.  The federal debt has more than doubled   rising 116 percent   and big annual deficits have continued.The chart below illustrates in more detail some of the positives and negatives, but at a glance, the president seems to been doing extraordinarily well on the economy, with the exception of income inequality and the comparatively flatlined weekly wages. An increased number of food stamp recipients since 2008 is never a good thing, but the good news is that the number has dropped since the previous FactCheck report.Regarding jobs, the following analysis of the decline in the infamous  labor participation rate  jumped off the screen:Contrary to many of Obama s critics, however, that decline is due mostly to factors outside the control of any president   factors such as the post-World War II baby boomers reaching retirement age. Survey data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in December show that those outside the labor force in 2014 said their reasons for not working were retirement (44 percent), illness or disability (19 percent), school attendance (18 percent) or home responsibilities (15 percent). Only 3 percent said they couldn t find a job, or gave some other reason.In other words, the Republicans often cite the low labor participation rate as a consequence of Obama s policies. Only, it s not. It s retiring baby boomers. Again, only three percent of the rate can be attributed to jobs.

"January 12, 2017","Missouri, in an attempt to make their state capitol building safer, has put into place security measures they didn t have before, however, it appears there s a problem.

Won t someone please think of those poor people?It turns out that Rep. Nick Marshall is quite the 2nd Amendment freedom fighter, and he has a solution to this less-than real problem.

He actually stuck a sign on his door that reads,  ATTENTION: Any constituent with a CCW that was refused to carry into the Capitol may borrow a firearm from Representative Marshall for the duration of the visit.

Elected officials may still carry concealed weapons, along with their staffs, but not the general public.Of course, every 2nd Amendment warrior in all of existence hates this kind of thing, including Marshall, because freedom and liberty and stuff. Another Facebook post of his on this issue says:Marshall and other gun nuts don t actually give a damn about the safety of the people around them. Democratic Rep. Stacey Newman said exactly that in her reaction to Marshall s sign: [I am] greatly disturbed by Rep. Marshall s offer to give guns to his constituents in the state Capitol, purposefully averting our new security restrictions and endangering everyone in the building, including legislators and staff. I am appalled that even my personal security is of no concern to my colleague. No doubt Marshall would say that he is concerned about her personal security, and the personal security of everyone in the building, which is why he will loan guns to anyone with a CCW that lost their weapon at the security checkpoint.Never mind that more access to guns tends to mean more shootings, whether they re intentional or accidental. The  good guy with a gun  myth is too powerful for these 2nd Amendment warriors, though, and they willfully put people in danger.

"January 13, 2016","Rick Scott is an absolutely horrible governor and literally gives zero f*cks about the people of Florida   even babies. Governor Scott is being accused of eliminating health standards for children s heart surgery after a hospital donated $200,000 to Republicans, including his own political action committee.In 2015, CNN revealed that St. Mary s Medical Center in West Palm Beach had an extremely high mortality rate in their pediatric cardiology program. Between 2011 and 2013, the hospital had a 12.5 percent death rate for open heart surgeries on babies and children; by comparison, the national average was 3.3 percent. So many children were dying at the hospital that in 2014 five independent pediatric heart doctors arrived at the hospital to review the program. The doctors were horrified by what they found, and recommended that the hospital stop performing surgery on babies under six months old and not perform any complicated procedures on older children.The hospital ignored their advice and more children and babies died. The state of Florida was warned by multiple highly respected cardiologists that the hospital had problems, but the state did nothing. Actually, that s not true, they did something far worse than nothing.Two moths after CNN s investigation was published, the state eliminated standards that have been in place for nearly forty years to protect pediatric heart patients. Why? Because during the same period of time that all of the children were dying in St. Mary s, the owners of the hospital, Tenet Healthcare, donated $200,000 to Rick Scott s PAC and the Republican Party of Florida.David Nykanen, co-director of the Heart Center at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, called the move to eliminate the standards AFTER the donations  too much  of a coincidence: The coincidence is just a little too much. It s just a little hard to swallow. Tenet s Shelly Weiss Friedberg told CNN that they had nothing to do with the state s decision: At no time have we discussed the pediatric cardiac standards with the governor or his office, or with any elected official or anyone on their staff. Our opinion was not sought on the standards nor have we expressed a position on the possible repeal of the standards or the role of the Cardiac Technical Advisory Panel. Nyakanen was not convinced, saying, If someone is contributing at that level, obviously they have to have some influence. If Tenet Healthcare contributed so much money, you d think they have the ear of the governor and the politicians. Last month Administrative Law Judge John Van Laningham agreed that the state should do away with the standards, claiming that suggesting the quality of healthcare would diminish is a little insulting to the health care professionals who personally deliver those services.  But at St. Mary s the quality was never there to begin with and if anything the state should have stepped in and prevented the hospital from ever operating on tiny humans again. Of course, this is Rick Scott s Florida that we are talking about and he cares little about the people of the state he was elected to serve.This is not the first time Rick Scott has screwed over the people of Florida when it comes to healthcare. The former hospital CEO/Medicare thief and House Republicans brought the government to a grinding halt when they refused to expand Medicaid to nearly a million of the state s working poor. Now that they have done this, it is absolutely crystal clear that Florida s GOP-led government will stop at nothing to help their donors   even if that means killing your children.Featured image via Facebook", Rick Scott Kills Babies By Eliminating Medical Standards After $200K Bribe From Hospital

"January 14, 2016","Fox Business held their second Republican debate, and things went off the rails almost immediately.Just a half hour in, Donald Trump was asked to address the comments he made alleging that fellow candidate Sen. Ted Cruz was not legally allowed to run for president because he was born in Canada. Cruz defended his eligibility by pointing out that the Constitutional requirement to run for president has always been interpreted to mean children of American citizens born in foreign countries were considered U.S. citizens just like anyone else. In one of the biggest burns of the night, Cruz went a step further by pointing out that some of the more  extreme  birther theories that Trump s fans support hold that not only does a child need to be born in the United States, but both parents need to be born in the country as well. By that logic, Cruz said, Donald Trump would be disqualified himself, because his mother was born in Scotland.Trump was not happy.Feigning concern for Cruz, Trump claims that if he were to choose Cruz as his vice presidential candidate, the Democrats would  sue, because we can t take him along for the ride.  Trump later claimed that if Cruz were to win the presidency, he would possibly face being kicked after a lawsuit over his eligibility. The entire auditorium was booing, but the jeers had been going on so long it was impossible to tell if they were meant for Trump, Cruz, or for the painful death of brain cells happening to everyone watching.By this point, the Republican Debate had come to a complete standstill. No questions were being asked. No other candidates were allowed to speak. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the two front-runners, were arguing on national television about birther conspiracy theories.

Instead, the authorities have let them play pretend Army for the last two weeks unimpeded. Instead of arresting them right away, instead they waited until they stole cars and charged them with that crime. And even then, it s only two members, when there are more than a hundred others there as well.This insurrection has cost the taxpayers an insane amount of money as well, as federal workers have been put on paid leave until the situation is resolved. The situation isn t any closer to any sort of peaceful resolution than it has been since its inception though; in fact, if anything, it is getting worse. Ammon Bundy and his hillbilly partners in crime are actually planning to completely ignore the government (like they aren t already), and instead set up their own laws on the occupied land. They also reportedly have plans to arrest the Harney County Sheriff. It has even been suggested that they should take on the FBI station that is keeping tabs on them.All of these fools need to be in jail. NOW. This has gone on long enough. They have disrupted the lives of every citizen in the area on an absolutely ridiculous level at this point, and the whole thing should have ended long ago.Featured image via YouTube screen capture", FINALLY: Two Members Of Bundy Militia Arrested

"January 16, 2016","Way back in 1998, when Fox s MadTV was still on the air, an actress/singer named Nicole Sullivan performed a three-minute comedy sketch that so accurately predicts the Donald Trump campaign, we just had to write about it.For the sketch, Sullivan adopted the character of Darlene McBride, a huge-haired country music singer, who is promoting her upcoming  Take Back America  tour.As the video opens, Sullivan s character can be seen strumming her guitar, while belting out the words to her new song,  Take Back America. Take back America to 1955,  she sings.  Take back America to when god was still alive. As the music fades into the background, McBride is seen sitting at a mirrored dressing table, dressed in camo, an American flag displayed proudly on the shoulder of her military fatigues. Truer words were never spoken, or sung,  she says.She then introduces herself. Hi, I m Darlene McBride. You know I love this country, the way it used to be, simple-minded, with simple values, simple people. But then the big government, the Supreme Court and those bleeding heart liberals just couldn t leave well enough alone. And now look at it? A big, ugly melting pot just boilin  over on what used to be a nice, white stove. From there, McBride goes on to talk about her upcoming tour, where she says she ll  be coming to a city near you, to sing traditional songs with traditional values. She then provides the audience with a few samples tunes that you can hear during the tour.For starters, there s a little ditty called The Lord Loves the NRA. The lord loves the NRA, he told me so the other day. He spelled it out in bullets in the sky. He s sitting up in heaven with his AK 47. He s a rough-and-ready, macho kind of guy. Then there s the song called The Back of the Bus.Leading into that one she says  Excuse me Mr. Negro, but I ve got a question to ask you. She then breaks into the song, asking in the lyrics,  What s so bad about the back of the bus? Next up is a song called Nothing Would Be Finer. Nothing would be finer than to drop a bomb on Chiner in the morning. She also has a song about illegal immigration called Hey Senorita.To be fair, all of the songs in this sketch would work for any GOP candidate, not just Trump. The NRA lovin , republican-Jesus fearin  racists and warmongers that vote for them would likely never realize they were listening to a musical parody of themselves.Watch the MadTV video below, courtesy of Migrainemaker on YouTube.While the sketch might seem like it was written to mock today s Teapublican Trump supporters, it s actually 18 years old.It goes to show, no matter how much time passes, the republican party does not change.

"January 16, 2017","There s one thing that Trump s surrogates all share, and that s a ridiculously blind loyalty to Trump. They can t see his evils, and their minds automatically twist any evil he says or does into something good.Such was the case on CNN, where Rick Santorum spoke up on Trump s trashing of civil rights icon John Lewis, who is also a Democratic representative from Georgia, and who said Trump is an illegitimate president.Trump has taken a lot of flak, especially given that he did it so close to Martin Luther King, Jr. s birthday. Former presidential adviser David Gergen was talking about why Trump was wrong to go after Lewis the way he did: This was an attack on [Lewis ] life, what he stands for, what he did for this country and marching across that bridge. Then former Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter weighed in with: When will the person who will be president act like a grownup and serious person, not always take the bait? Show some restraint, show some dignity. There is no bottom to the depth that he will go to argue with anyone, and cause disdain. Donald Trump was wrong. John Lewis is an icon. He can say whatever he wants. When Santorum got a chance to speak, he said he and most other people in politics would have handled Lewis  comments much differently. Then he put forth this obscene gem: Donald Trump is the president because he did things like this. Which just speaks to how low Trump s voters really are. If anyone can defend Trump s pettiness that way, or in any way, they are just as ridiculous as he is.Watch the fireworks below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video", WATCH: CNN Panel EXPLODES After Rick Santorum Gives DISGUSTING Defense Of Trump’s Racism
"January 17, 2016","Just hours before the final Democratic primary debate, Bernie Sanders has finally released his full healthcare plan.On his campaign site, Sanders lays out how important the Affordable Care Act has been. He notes that he, himself, helped contribute to the huge piece of legislation that helped to provide 17 million people with health insurance.But Sanders believes that it is time to move forward with a national healthcare system that provides coverage to all. He writes on his site: All Americans can benefit from increased protections against lifetime coverage limits and exclusion from coverage because of pre-existing conditions, Sanders says. But as we move forward, we must build upon the success of the ACA to achieve the goal of universal health care. Twenty-nine million Americans today still do not have health insurance and millions more are underinsured and cannot afford the high copayments and deductibles charged by private health insurance companies that put profits before people. There has been some controversy between Democrats this week relating to the issue of Sanders  proposal to implement a universal healthcare system in the United States. Concerns over how this program would be funded have been of particular interest to the public. Sanders lays that out in plain detail for all to read.Most of the health care plan receives its funding from new progressive taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Some people in the middle class might pay a tiny bit more in taxes. According to the campaign website,  A family of four making $50,000 a year taking the standard deduction would only pay $466 this year.  That small increase in taxes isn t anything to what a similar family would save under Sanders  plan. They would save around $5,000 dollars a year. Last year, the average working family paid $4,955 in premiums and $1,318 in deductibles to private health insurance companies. Under this plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would pay just $466 per year to the single-payer program, amounting to a savings of over $5,800 for that family each year,  the site reads.It long past time that the United States join every other industrialized nation in the world and implement a national single-payer healthcare system. That s what the ACA was presented as a stepping stone towards. Regardless of who is the eventual Democratic nominee, the fight for healthcare as a right need to be at the top of the Democratic platform. Democrats should not have to apologize for wanting to live in a nation where every person can get the healthcare they need.Should a better proposal than Sanders  be presented, it should be adopted. There may be some strategic advantages to wanted to expand the ACA very gradually, but we are talking about people s lives. But there are some big cracks in the ACA. Cracks that 29 million people have fallen through. It is time that we come together and demand that, no person deserves to be left behind.You can read a full break down of the plan here.Featured Image Credit: Phil Roeder via Flickr ", Bernie Sanders Reveals His Full Health Care Funding Plan: The 1% Are Going To Hate It
"January 17, 2017","Before running the most controversial and bombastic political campaign in recent presidential history, Donald Trump was perhaps best known for plastering his name, preferably plated in gold, across absolutely everything he could   especially on very tall phallic symbols. He might not be as proud of his latest namesake, though. It s a moth and it s known for its weird  hair  and its tiny genitalia.Image via Twitter.This centimeter-wide moth was identified by evolutionary biologist and lepidopterist Vazrick Nazari, who announced the find in a paper published Tuesday in the open-access journal ZooKeys. Nazari settled on the name N. donaldtrumpi because the silky yellow-white scales these moths develop on their heads in adulthood reminded him of the President-elect s signature hairdo.By meticulously examining specimens of the moth and its close relatives, Nazari was able to catalogue its unique anatomy, including its male genitalia, which is  comparatively smaller  than the moth s close relative Neopalpa neonata, according to the study.Source: MotherboardOh, but it gets worse for the President Elect. The moth is native to Trump s nemesis state of California, and into Mexico. Did I mention that it has really tiny genitals? Well, it s worth mentioning again.The moth is also known as a Twirler Moth, and like the man it s named from, it exhibits unexplainable bursts of frantic behavior. If it had hands, it would probably be tweeting weird vendettas at 3:00 am as well.Naming the moth after Trump wasn t just a silly jab at the thin-skinned man baby about to occupy the Oval Office. It was a pretty clever attempt at bringing attention to the moth and to the environment. By naming this species after the 45th President of the United States, I hope to bring some public attention to, and interest in, the importance of alpha-taxonomy in better understanding the neglected micro-fauna component of the North American biodiversity. The timing couldn t be better. Republicans are already set to roll back parts of the Endangered Species Act.Dr. Peter Oboyski, manager and curator of the Essig Museum of Entomology at University of California, Berkeley, hopes that this finding will help bring attention to all species of moths, most of which we may never discover, before they go extinct. As for Trump, Dr. Oboyski said:Hopefully our new president will take pride in having a species named for him, recognize the enormous task set before biologists and encourage his administration to support research to discover and describe the overwhelming biodiversity all around us while it is still there.Let s hope.Featured image via Christopher Furlong/Getty Images"," Donald Trump’s Latest Namesake Has Bad Hair And Small Genitals, But It Flies"
"January 18, 2016","Muslims care more about the people of Flint, Michigan than Republicans do.The Republican-caused disaster unfolding in Michigan is incredibly infuriating. In a penny-pinching scheme, Governor Rick Snyder and his emergency management henchmen decided to switch Flint s water supply from Lake Huron to the nearby river, which has been undrinkable for decades due to high levels of lead and other industrial chemicals.For well over a year, the residents have been forced to drink and bathe in this water all while Republicans insist that the water is perfectly safe.So far, Republicans have done very little to fix their mess. Instead, they been busy trying to absolve themselves of any responsibility, which is why President Obama stepped in to do their job for them. And now, Muslims are coming to the rescue as well. Who is Hussain?  is an organization honoring the memory of Imam Hussain ibn Ali, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad who was killed by extremists by speaking out against violence. He died by being denied water over the course of several days. The organization believes that denying water to any human being is unacceptable and bringing water to those who need it is part of their campaign.And the organization has already collected 30,000 bottles of fresh drinking water for the Red Cross to distribute to the residents of Flint, even though Republicans and conservatives across the state and the nation have demonized Muslims repeatedly. Despite the hatred and racism hurled against them, they have chosen to help anyway. Prophet Mohammad taught us  Your neighbor comes before your own household.  As a resident of Detroit this is not only a Flint problem this is a Michigan problem and I feel obligated to help to the best of my ability,  said Mohammed Almawla, who helped collect water for Flint. We saw what needed to be done and we decided to do it,  said event organizer Dr. Aziza Asakari.  We reached out to schools, neighbors, friends, mosques, anyone and everyone to help us by donating a case of water, or money towards a case. This inspiring story is the very definition of American values. A group of people coming together for the purposes of helping a community in need. No one would blame these Muslims for turning their backs on their fellow citizens for the way they have been treated recently, but they chose to come to their aid despite the discrimination they have faced by the right-wing in recent months.Republicans should be ashamed of themselves. They poisoned the citizens of Flint, Michigan and have failed to take responsibility. Governor Rick Snyder should have resigned by now but he refuses to do so. Now Muslims are working to provide clean water to the residents in an act of humanity that proves once and for all that conservatives are full of shit whenever they talk about Muslims. Muslims are helping the American citizens that Republicans willingly chose to harm. It s pretty easy to recognize that it is Republicans, and not Muslims, who are the real threat to our safety and security.Featured Image: Washington Times "," Muslims Respond To Republican Mess By Bringing 30,000 Bottles Of Clean Water To Flint Residents"
"January 18, 2017","Trump really needs his Twitter account permanently suspended, or someone needs to find a way to permanently lock him out of the platform. His tweets claiming credit for job creation he had nothing to do with, plus his blasting companies when they don t do what he wants, and his threat of a 35 percent  border tax,  has businesses terrified of ending up on his radar.And how are they responding? By repeating job announcements, or preemptively announcing new jobs and investments in the U.S., as if they are new developments, in order to appease Trump and generate fake news about  new  jobs. After Trump blasted Toyota on his Twitter account, the industry was nervous and wondering who was next.Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017He s gone after Lockheed-Martin and Boeing, too, plus others. Kristin Dziczek, a spokeswoman for the Center for Automotive Research said: Pretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet. Getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with. So they re doing the only thing they can think of to do. They re appeasing him. They ve been cowed. They ve been bullied. They ve been intimidated and coerced and it s ridiculous and disgusting.Most of the things they re announcing in the way of investment and job creation are things that are years in the making. For instance, GM admitted that they accelerated their plans under pressure from Trump, but those plans very likely date back to 2014.And GM has been bringing jobs back to the U.S. for years already.Walmart s plans are their usual annual plans. Sprint s jobs were part of an older promise from their parent company to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S. And Bayer and Monsanto, if they re allowed to merge, will be investing and spending what they already invest and spend here.Still, though, Trump has the entire corporate world running scared. If they were running scared in the right ways, this might actually be good. When they re acting because they re afraid of the president and his Twitter account, there s a serious problem.The automakers have started to time their announcements so that they appear to be Trump s doing, for the sole purpose of staying out of his line of fire. Other companies will probably start following suit, if for no other reason than to avoid having their reputations and stocks tank because Trump had a snit on Twitter.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images", Trump TERRIFIES Businesses So Badly They’re Doing THIS To Avoid His Dangerous Fits (DETAILS)
"January 19, 2016","Governor Rick Snyder should probably stay off social media for the rest of his life.During an interview on Monday, the Republican governor admitted that the Flint water crisis was mishandled; however, he didn t quite go so far as to blame himself. After all, he s a Republican. Everyone else is to blame. The checks and balances that theoretically could have been there didn t work. This is a mess. I mean, I feel terrible about all this happening. And that s why I m working hard to do everything I can to repair the damage and then actually work to strengthen Flint and the citizens. After being asked if this is his Katrina, Snyder said that  it s a disaster. So far, ten people have died and the entire community has been forced to deal with a calamity that never should have happened in the first place. In a lazy attempt to save money, the state switched Flint s water supply from Lake Huron a the river which has been undrinkable for decades due to lead and other industrial chemicals. In short, the state provided the residents of Flint with poisoned water.Snyder has taken a lot of criticism since the disaster gained national attention, especially from Rachel Maddow, and many have called for his resignation and prosecution, which is why he posted an ill-advised tweet on Sunday.

So it s been public knowledge that Flint River has been contaminated for 50 years now, but officials appointed by Snyder made the switch anyway and ignored history and the facts.That is why kids are going to have problems in the coming years are they become adults and it is why 10 human beings are dead and it is why an entire community is in crisis. A crisis that only third-world countries usually have to deal with. And that is precisely why Rick Snyder should resign in disgrace and face prosecution.

"January 19, 2017","Well, here we are. The last day of eight years that is the Obama presidency. For eight years, we all saw a swarm of friends and acquaintances regurgitate the most asinine conspiracy theories about President Obama imaginable. Whether they came from Sarah Palin or Alex Jones, right-wing looney tunes were always a far cry from the truth. Today we have a new term for it: fake news. But we must always remember what it truly is: conspiracy theories.Now that the great and honorable President Obama leaves office tomorrow, let s remind the  economically anxious  red America:Congratulations on letting yourself be played for the last 8 years! It was quite a sight to behold, both sad and funny that teetered on the brink of near insanity. Hopefully, this will be a learning experience to turn off the TV, quit with the fake news, and apply some common sense, no?Considering they just elected the biggest conspiracy theorist around, one shouldn t get their hopes up.Now that Trump has already broken a slew of promises, watch as red state citizens still bitterly cling to their guns and bibles while finding a way to somehow blame Obama.It is nearly impossible to record how much money, time and brain cells Republicans lost being perpetually lied to by the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, Alex Jones, Dinesh D Souza, Bill O Reilly, Michele Bachmann and the rest of the right-wing brigade.The fact that Republicans allowed their minds to be poisoned for nine years (counting the campaign in 2008) will have long lasting effects for generations to come and will continue to throughout the Trump presidency.President Obama got one thing wrong: there is a blue state America and a red state America. But it goes so much deeper than that. There s an alert America and an easily duped America. There s a truthful America and an untruthful America. Luckily, Democrats were the former, and sadly Republicans allowed themselves to be the latter.But it wasn t always like this. In January 2009, as President Obama prepared to take office, 71 percent of America came together to support the new incumbent. Then the power of talk radio prevailed, and America was to be utterly transformed, never to be the same again.President Obama will leave office with a 60 percent approval rating. Perhaps a chunk of the GOP electorate realizes they have been manipulated.Going forward, Democrats and progressives alike need to be cautious of what they share and believe. Allowing our disdain for Trump to border on conspiracy is a dangerous route to take.Be vigilant, but be smart.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"," Congratulations, Republicans, You Got Played"
"January 2, 2016","Last year, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy made national headlines for his insane standoff with government officials over the illegal grazing of his cattle, and now his three sons have followed in his footsteps by taking up arms with  about 150  armed and dangerous militia members in an Oregon wildlife reserve. They are occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge HQ in protest of the expected detainment of two ranchers in the area who are expected to face federal arson charges. Ammon Bundy, the presumed leader of this ridiculous occupation, made a video that was later uploaded to social media, where he said: We re going to be freeing these lands up, and getting ranchers back to ranching, getting the loggers back to logging, getting the miners back to mining where they could do it under the protection of the people and not be afraid of this tyranny that s been set upon them. These people need to learn that they are not above the law. This  occupation  is illegal, and if they are taking up arms against the government they and all of their participants and supporters need to be hauled into federal custody and charged. That was the mistake before   Cliven Bundy and his right-wing militiamen never spent so much as a day behind bars for their insanity. Now, Ammon Bundy, his brothers, and other like-minded morons want to rule themselves free from government oversight in their own nutty enclave.Another presumed group leader, a man by the name of Blane Cooper, speaks in the video and trashes the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as the equivalent of  high school bullies : Until that line is drawn and say  we ve had enough of this tyranny, you are going to leave us alone  it will not change.

"January 2, 2017","House Republicans just made it clear that they are for sale and intend to put ethics aside during Donald Trump s reign in the White House.On Monday night, Republicans voted 119-74 to cripple the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which has been an outside watchdog working to root out corruption by members of Congress ever since a string of lobbying scandals rocked Capitol Hill. Under Speaker Nancy Pelosi s leadership, the panel was created as a non-partisan entity and has done a good job.But Republicans are gutting it because the panel has done its job too well so they passed an amendment which basically gives them direct oversight of the panel and the power to kill investigations they don t like. So if the panel is investigating a Republicans, they can kill it and then turn around and allow an investigation against a Democrat.According to CNN,The proposal would bar the panel from reviewing any violation of criminal law by members of Congress, requiring that it turn over any complaint to the House Ethics Committee or refer the matter to an appropriate federal law enforcement agency. The House Ethics Committee would also have the power to stop an investigation at any point and bars the ethics office from making any public statements about any matters or hiring any communications staff.And the ethics office would no longer be able to accept or investigate any anonymous reports of alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress.Republicans claim that the ethics panel abused its power and that it  falsely accused  members of Congress of committing ethics violations. These members allegedly had to  spend a fortune  to defend themselves. Frankly, it sounds like Republicans are just mad because they got caught putting their hand in the cookie jar and they are attacking the panel to make sure they can t be caught again.By gutting the independent panel and placing it under their supervision, Republicans just paved the way for their members to commit crimes at will. They could a take a bribe from a lobbyist and then vote to kill any investigation that arises. It will create a free-for-all for lobbyists at a time when Republicans intend to consider infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and massive defense spending.This especially concerns Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics attorneys under President Obama and President Bush, because the 115th Congress  is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated. So not only will the White House be corrupt under Donald Trump, Republicans just guaranteed that the House of Representatives is going to be corrupt as well, proving once again that Republicans only care about using government to enrich themselves instead of helping the American people.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images", House Republicans Pave Way For Rampant Corruption Under Trump By Gutting Independent Ethics Panel
"January 20, 2016","On Wednesday, President Obama took a trip to North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, but while he was there he took time out of his itinerary to talk about the water crisis in Flint   and he didn t mince his words.During a speech, the president let the people of Flint know that he hears their cries: I am very proud of what I ve done as president, but the only job that s more important to me is the job of father. And I know if I was a parent up there, I would be beside myself if my kids  health could be at risk. That s why over the weekend I declared a federal emergency in Flint. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) has identified at least twenty-seven kids with elevated levels of lead in their blood. However, that number is likely astronomically higher when you consider how long the people of Flint were drinking the contaminated water Governor Rick Snyder assuredthem was safe   even when he knew it wasn t. Unlike Obama, Snyder didn t think about how terrified parents must be for their children. His main concern was  balancing  a budget, safety be damned.The president also blasted Republican lawmakers for  short-changing  the people of Flint: It is a reminder of why you can t shortchange basic services that we provide to our people and that we together provide as a government to make sure that public health and safety is preserved. The horrifying thing about all of this is that if it were up to the GOP, this would happen a helluva a lot more often. The Republican Party absolutely despises regulations that they believe are unnecessary   that includes clean water and air.  As a matter of fact, last week while the Flint water crisis was raging on, Republicans in the House voted to overturn provisions of the Clean Water Act that protects streams. Last June, Senate Republicans voted to repeal the very same thing.Think about that for a minute. Lawmakers on both a state and federal level have known about the crisis in Flint for more than a year, and the GOP voted to repeal laws related to clean water at least TWICE in that time. These pro-life lawmakers didn t care at all that tiny humans were literally being poisoned, the only thing that mattered was sticking it to Obama because they didn t like his new provisions for the Clean Water Act.While Republican representatives in the federal government were trying to gut the Clean Water Act, Governor Snyder was busy ignoring the crisis in Flint. He knew that people were drinking dirty and instead of fixing the problem he just allowed children to continue to ingest lead. Not only did he know it was happening, he didn t care enough to stop it!The Flint water crisis a perfect example of what happens when Republicans are left in charge of anything   and it s terrifying.Watch:Featured image: video screenshot"," Obama Visits Michigan, Blasts Republicans For ‘Short-Changing Basic Services’ (VIDEO)"
"January 20, 2017","The White House s official website used to have lengthy pages on several topics, including climate change, the ACA, LGBTQ rights and civil rights, among other things. The instant the clock struck noon in Washington, though, Trump and his admin furiously began scrubbing the site of pretty much everything they don t like.Obama once had a very long and detailed page dedicated exclusively to fighting climate change, which is an issue that s growing in importance. 2015 was once the hottest year on record. Now 2016 is the hottest year on record. In other words, the planet is heating faster and faster, according to real science, but Trump and his administration still seem to think climate change is either a hoax, or it s a nuisance to be destroyed.Otherwise Trump wouldn t have appointed Scott Pruitt, a lying climate denier as head of the EPA, which he also happens to be suing (or was).Scientists have been scrambling to preserve as much government climate data as possible in recent weeks, downloading everything to a network of servers in Canada where Herr Trump can t touch it. And now their fears that Trump wants to squash talk of man-made climate change are starting to play out.Trump s only mention of anything having to do with the environment is his  America First Energy Plan.  That plan is committed to rolling back EPA rules and expanding fossil fuel operations because that s obviously the magic bullet we need for jobs, energy growth and the environment (the truth was spoken by a coal miner who, on Dec. 22, blasted any ideas that we can actually bring coal jobs back to coal country to smithereens).Where once there was a fount of information, a search for  climate change,   global warming,  and anything along those lines on the White House s site suddenly reveals a whole lot of nothing.  It s completely normal for whitehouse.gov to change rapidly with an incoming administration, but it doesn t appear to be customary to scrub all references to absolutely everything the incoming administration has been sneering at the whole time.Motherboard s Jason Koebler made this all the more ominous by saying: Scientists I ve spoken to who are archiving websites say they expect scientific data on the NASA, NOAA, Department of Energy, and EPA websites to be neglected or deleted eventually. They say they don t expect agency sites to be updated immediately, but expect it to play out over the course of months. This sort of low-key data destruction might not be the type of censorship people typically think about, but scientists are treating it as such. Do we really have to wonder whether Trump will try and censor all climate change information everywhere? No, we really do not.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images", Trump Just Waved His Magic Wand And Made Major Information On Climate Change Disappear (IMAGES)
"January 21, 2016","Sarah Palin went full Looney Tunes on Tuesday and @Midnight host Chris Hardwick knows exactly which character she channeled during her speech.During Wednesday night s episode of the Comedy Central program, Hardwick kicked off the show with footage from Sarah Palin s endorsement of Republican billionaire presidential wannabe Donald Trump.While not denying that her whole speech was a rambling incoherent rant, one particular part of the speech caught Hardwick s attention. Yesterday, Donald Trump received a significant endorsement from feral snow-MILF Sarah Palin,  Hardwick began.  Sadly, no one could really understand it. Hardwick then played a clip on a Vine showing a piece of Palin s crazy speech, the full transcript of which you can read here. How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution. Tell us that we re not red enough? Yeah, coming from the establishment. Right. It was an attack on President Obama s past statement about bitter conservatives who cling to their guns and religion, but Hardwick couldn t resist mocking Palin. You betcha!  Hardwick said imitating Palin s voice.  You gosh-darn betcha! What with the flim-flammin , sock-darnin  every kinda woof-wrestlin , moose cobbler coolin  on the windowsill, baseball chuckin , flag-wavers, troop salutin , country lovin  anthem hummers, and no to the gays. But somehow, that nonsense sounds kinda familiar,  Hardwick continued before playing a clip of the gun-slinging mustachioed Looney Tunes character Yosemite Sam throwing a temper tantrum in the same way Palin said her line about right-wingers, which drew laughs from the audience.Hardwick then asked the three comedians standing in front of him to define what  bitter clingin , proud clingers  are. I have no clue but I m sure they re uncomfortable around black people,  James Davis replied, drawing a chuckle from Hardwick.Jen Kirkman ended the segment by saying that it s  a lizard that clings to a tree during a hurricane and blames Mexicans for everything. Here s the video via YouTube:This is an absolutely perfect comparison. It could also be said that Palin and conservatives like her could be compared to Elmer Fudd or Wyle E. Coyote as well.

According to McClatchy, Trump set the record for numbers of prayers in his inauguration.While for most Americans, that statistic might elicit, at best, a yawn, Sarah Palin (yes, she has a blog now) was the one who jumped on it most enthusiastically, with this clickbait headline:Donald Trump was inaugurated yesterday as America s 45th President yesterday.In the midst of the ceremonies, he set a record and a surprising one, at that.President Trump set the record for the most prayers ever said during an inaugural ceremony.While not as clickbaitey, that non-record record was covered by The Kansas City Star and conservative blogs like Townhall.We weren t the only people noticing the desperation in this story:@kberntson2 @SarahPalinUSA What kind of devout Christian assaults women and stiffs people who work for him?

The voting members of the Academy, it turns out, average more than 60-years-old and are predominantly white males.As nominees for this year s Academy Awards were released, minority members noticed that the coveted Oscars were going to once again be a gathering of the Hollywood White Boys Club. This year, however, some of the most influential people in the industry decided to take a stand. After actors of the calibre of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and director Spike Lee, along with many other highly respected minorities in the business boycotted the event, the Academy began looking fo a solution to the #OscarsSoWhite problem.That solution came today, as the Academy announced that they will be changing the rules of voting for members, which is expected to weed out some of those who havenb t been active for years yet still cast their votes for anyone who is white, male and heterosexual.The new rules, according to a statement from Academy  President Cheryl Boone Isaacs, are as follows:The statement also outlines other measures the Academy is looking to take to increase the diversity of its membership to better represent the work contributed by minorities and women.The Academy s proactive approach to solving a problem that wasn t going to just go away is a breath of fresh air.

"January 22, 2017","After Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the gall to defend blatant Trump administration lies as  alternative facts,  Dan Rather, one of the few real journalists left in our country, took to Facebook and called for action. These are not normal times,  Rather said.  These are extraordinary times. And extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Conway wasn t the only person who suffered Rather s wrath, but he called her phrase  Orwellian,  which it was. Rather also talked about Sean Spicer, who, as he said, threatened, bullied and lied to reporters before walking out of the briefing room without even answering a question. He also called out the administration for its lies.Rather remarked that we ve never seen this before, but he has some suggestions for the media. The first of which is to not be afraid to call a lie a lie. Even more than from the press, though, Rather wants to see that kind of bravery come from Congress.There is one group of people who can do a lot   very quickly. And that is Republicans in Congress. Without their support, Donald Trump s presidency will falter. So here is what I think everyone in the press must do. If you are interviewing a Paul Ryan, a Mitch McConnell, or any other GOP elected official, the first question must be  what will you do to combat the lying from the White House?  If they dodge and weave, keep with the follow ups. And if they refuse to give a satisfactory answer, end the interview.Facts and the truth are not partisan. They are the bedrock of our democracy. And you are either with them, with us, with our Constitution, our history, and the future of our nation, or you are against it. Everyone must answer that question.It s true.

"January 23, 2016","It s hard to believe that it s been nearly 13 years since Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks perfectly spoke her mind in reference to the impending Iraq war. If you don t remember what she said, let me remind you: Just so you know, we re on the good side with y all. We do not want this war, this violence, and we re ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas. This, of course, sparked a huge backlash against not only Maines, but the Dixie Chicks. People everywhere couldn t believe that she d have the perfect audacity to speak up against an unjust war and against the president who was leading the charge into Iraq. Dissent is usually considered patriotic, but apparently not if the dissenting voice is against a warmongering conservative president.Well, dusting off her infamous quote on Twitter, Maines just completely roasted Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz.

The first being from former President Eisenhower, a man who knew the dangers of war, because he lived through the worst we ve ever had. Then paired with Sen. Cruz, a Canadian born chickenhawk, and far from the Republican that Eisenhower was, who claims he ll  carpet bomb  the enemy to make them  glow in the dark. Maines reminds America of the stupidity of electing yet another senseless fool to the White House and the inevitable war it would cause. A war that would send thousands more of our troops to unnecessarily die. However, Maines does it with a perfectly sarcastic spin when she says: Just so you know .I m ashamed Ted Cruz is from America;) The wink is seemingly insinuating two things: that he s a repeat of George W. Bush, so the same quote was necessary, and also that he was born in Canada, which was confirmed with this tweet:I stand corrected Just so you know, I'm ashamed Ted Cruz claims to be American. pic.twitter.com/JUltNImOXH  Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) January 24, 2016Cruz is definitely a person to be ashamed of, because not only is he dangerous, he s smarmy as hell and as greasy as a used car salesman to get what he wants done.

"January 23, 2017","This should come as a surprise to no one ever because alleged president Donald Trump has a seedy financial interest in the Dakota Access Access Pipeline. Energy Transfers Partners, the very company that is the pipeline, donated $100,000 to a Trump Victory Fund before the election in the hopes that he d greenlight it, Mother Jones reported.In fact, according to disclosure forms at the time, Trump had as much as $300,000 personally invested in the project.As it happens, our alleged president will likely overturn a permit denial that prohibited the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which was the focus of months of massive protests by Native Americans and others who took part in the demonstrations, the Independent reports. I m not going to get in front of the President s executive actions,  Spicer said,  but I will tell you that areas like the Dakota and Keystone pipeline are areas that we can increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into America s energy supply. That s something that he s been very clear about. Without elaborating, Press Secretary Sean Spicer did not provide specifics about the newly minted president s plans regarding continuing construction of the DAPL and the Keystone XL Pipeline. However, Spicer did suggest that the new administration would move forward with the project.Trump s plan to go forward with the Dakota Access Pipeline isn t going down well on social media.Spicer won t  get in front  of Trump on Keystone or #DAPL, but people will sure as hell get in front of Keystone & #DAPL to stop them.

"January 24, 2016","A couple of days ago a woman in Washington was shot while watching the Benghazi movie  13 Hours  and thanks to the United States  obsession with guns. We are now learning that the shooter, Dane Gallion, 29, had a gun on him during the movie because he was terrified of being killed during a mass shooting.According to the Seattle Times:Dane Gallion, 29, told officers he took the gun to Regal Cinemas 14 at the Landing on Thursday night because he was  concerned about recent mass shootings in public places,  according to a police account in a probable-cause statement released Saturday.That same anxiety prompted him to keep the gun unholstered in his waistband, the statement says.Think about that for a minute: our country has had so many mass shootings that this man was so scared to go to the movies, he felt he had to bring a weapon to protect himself.We all know that the  good guy with a gun  rhetoric that the National Rifle Association and Republicans like to spew is complete nonsense, but not everyone is as educated as those of us who want stricter gun laws. A great number of people are willfully ignorant and just believe the lines they are fed from the gun lobby and their supporters.This, of course, doesn t excuse the shooting. It definitely should have never happened. A gun owner should know how to properly handle a gun so that things like this do not happen. Frankly, Gallion should have never been allowed to carry a gun if he was that paranoid; After all, paranoia makes people do reckless things.However, it certainly proves how damaging the last decade or so s mass shootings have been on the psyches of the people in this country. Personally, I have a little ball of fear in the pit of my stomach every single time I go to the movies too, or when I drop my elementary school aged child off at school. How sad is that?

Well, we don t need to look past what Hitler did after the Reichstag fire:Using emergency constitutional powers, Adolf Hitler s cabinet had issued a Decree for the Protection of the German People on February 4, 1933. This decree placed constraints on the press and authorized the police to ban political meetings and marches, effectively hindering electoral campaigning. A temporary measure, it was followed by a more dramatic and permanent suspension of civil rights following the February 27 burning of the parliament building.Though the origins of the fire are still unclear, in a propaganda maneuver, the coalition government (Nazis and the German Nationalist People s Party) blamed the Communists. They exploited the Reichstag fire to secure President von Hindenburg s approval for an emergency decree, the Decree for the Protection of the People and the State of February 28. Popularly known as the Reichstag Fire Decree, the regulations suspended the right to assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and other constitutional protections, including all restraints on police investigations.Justified on the false premise that the Communists were planning an uprising to overthrow the state, the Reichstag Fire Decree permitted the regime to arrest and incarcerate political opponents without specific charge, dissolve political organizations, and to suppress publications. It also gave the central government the authority to overrule state and local laws and overthrow state and local governments.Donald Trump is moving quickly, and we can no longer ignore the threat he poses. Write your legislators right now   seriously, do it right now   and demand that someone (anyone) begin organizing his impeachment immediately.

She s a staunch feminist and a human rights activist, taking a strong position on the rights of refugees. She recently made news when she gave an extraordinary speech at the United Nations, advocating for the rights of women around the world. She also recently tweeted in solidarity with the refugees coming to Europe in search for safety after years of war and torment in Syria.That was more than enough for anti-feminist and anti-refugee trolls to attack Thomson by using her humanitarianism against her.  There is a petition circulating that challenges Watson to live in a camp in Calais, France. Entitled  Spend one week in a Calais migrant camp for feminism (without bodyguards),  the petition states: In order to show how safe current migration is to Europe, particularly regarding the cause of feminism (I reject wholeheartedly the notion that North African and Middle Eastern migrants are unsafe, and rapists), Emma Watson should spend a week s holiday in a Calais migrant camp, without guards of course, to show how safe, and how pro feminism these migrants are. It all started with one simple humanitarian tweet:#refugeeswelcome  Emma Watson (@EmWatson) September 7, 2015The tweet has since garnered plenty of responses for and against Watson s stance.

Her simultaneous embrace of female equality, mass migration and the misogynistic non-western cultures brought with it, is widely seen as typical of left wing activists today. In this context, the petition can be interpreted as an expression of frustration with the contradictions of modern liberal feminism, rather than merely a personal attack on Ms. Watson. Watson, who is best known for her role as Hermione in the Harry Potter films, was made a Goodwill Women s Ambassador by the United Nations in 2014 and has been passionately using her platform to advocate for the betterment of humanity.

Millions of Americans are about to lose their healthcare. Millions across the country are going to have to deal with polluted air and water. And Trump s isolationist foreign policy and bullying tactics are going to put our national security in serious jeopardy. His refusal to acknowledge climate change is going to put millions of Americans, their homes, and their businesses at risk all along the coastline as the sea level rises.In short, Trump is saying one thing, but doing something completely different.

"January 27, 2016","The spectacle of Donald Trump rejecting Fox News  debate got even more ridiculous on Wednesday night as the network s highest rated host, Bill O Reilly, got involved in the clown show.Despite shunning Fox, Trump still decided to appear on The O Reilly Factor in a satellite interview with the host. Discussing Trump s public tantrum, O Reilly all but got down on bended knee and asked Trump to reconsider his decision: I m trying to convince you that your tack is wrong, because it s better for the folks to see you in the debate format,  Mr. O Reilly said.He pointed to Newt Gingrich using negative questions during the debate in South Carolina in 2012 to great effect as he pummeled the moderator John King of CNN in the Republican primary campaign. Mr. Gingrich later won the primary in the state.  I m telling you, that s the way to go here,  Mr. O Reilly said. This has to do with the stupidity of Fox and what they did,  Mr. Trump said.O Reilly even pointed to his cheek, asking the reality TV star and current Republican front-runner to turn the other cheek after being angered at the network for a combative press release reports indicate was personally written by network boss, Roger Ailes.Trump rebuffed the overture, telling O Reilly he is more in the mood for an eye for an eye, wounding Fox in his perspective by hurting the ratings for the network and its advertisers.In addition to Trump s direct refusal to engage, his campaign cronies have also been spreading the conspiracy theory that Fox is in cahoots with Hillary Clinton, despite the network s pivotal role over the last 20 years in attacking and smearing Democrats, particularly the former Secretary of State.Taking advantage of the chaos, fellow candidate Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has asked Trump to hold a one-on-one Lincoln/Douglas style debate with him. Trump has refused, and some believe the gambit is Trump attempting to opt out of debates even if he is the Republican nominee, an unprecedented cowardly move.Featured image via YouTube", This Fox News Host Is Personally Begging Trump To Come To Their Debate (VIDEO)
"January 27, 2017","We know that Trump wants to ban Muslims from being able to enter the U.S. at all, but faces significant hurdles to actually do it. So he just did an end run around all those obstacles by instituting what he keeps calling  extreme vetting,  because he apparently believes that our current vetting process for refugees is not only non-existent, but preferential towards Muslims, and discriminatory towards Christians.Today, he signed two executive orders   one to spur new defense spending, and another to ban visa entries from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen (but not countries where he has business, because of course), and to institute  extreme vetting  for refugees: I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We don t want them here.We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people. Can we say Muslim ban? There s the above, plus Trump actually told the Christian Broadcasting Network s David Brody the following: [Syrian Christians have] been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them. There are a lot of conclusions that can be drawn from that alone, but aside from Trump s insane lie namely that we deliberately discriminate against Christians this action sounds an awful lot like a precursor to his Muslim ban. If he were to support Sen. Tom Cotton s bill that would allow religious minorities to apply directly for refugee status here, while Muslim refugees would likely still have to go through the U.N., suddenly Muslims have a harder time getting here than anyone else.It s true that we get a lot more Muslim refugees than Christian refugees, but there s a reason for that and it s not because we re favoring Muslims. Currently, refugees are generally referred to the United States via the United Nations  refugee camp in Jordan   they don t apply to the U.S. directly. It s a majority Muslim region   therefore most applicants are going to be Muslims.Christians then go to the more urban areas where they re likely to be safer, and they might be coming into the U.S. by way of other immigration pathways.Put all of these things together, along with Republicans  desire to end funding for the U.N., and we re most of the way to an out-and-out Muslim ban without actually creating a law or an edict that bans Muslims.Featured image by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images", It’s Official: Trump Just Created His Muslim Ban Without Ever Creating An Actual Ban On Muslims

"January 28, 2017","Attorneys are racing to the defense of a child after the little girl was detained by airport security because of the Muslim ban signed by Donald Trump.On Saturday, Trump told the press that his executive order banning Muslims from entering the United was  working out very nicely  amid the mass chaos that has ensued ever since he issued the order. It s not a Muslim ban, but we re totally prepared,  Trump claimed.  It s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over. It s working out very nicely and we re gonna have a very, very strict ban and we re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years. Except that it s NOT  working very nicely  at all.Thousands of people are finding themselves stranded or detained at airports because of the order. Even holders of green cards are being prevented from entering the United States despite being citizens of this nation. Protests against Trump s order have also been popping up at airports across the country.And things got even worse on Saturday evening when security at Dulles International Airport detained a five-year-old girl and refused to let her mother see her.Seriously, how in the hell is a five-year-old girl even considered a terror threat in this country?Former Governor Howard Dean posted the news on Twitter and pleaded for an attorney to go to the scene to rescue the girl as soon as possible.This is now a violation of a federal court order. A lawyer is needed at Dulles. https://t.co/g2lUc3EYuP  Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) January 29, 2017Indeed, a federal judge issued an emergency stay against Trump s executive order earlier on Saturday which prevents the government from sending people out of the country if they have visas allowing them entry.So a scared little girl is literally being detained and kept from her mother because Donald Trump is an asshole.

"January 29, 2016","Ted Cruz was approached at a campaign stop in New Hampshire and asked to give a response to Trump s latest attack, in which he calls Cruz a  Canadian anchor baby.  In and of itself, the question was not that fruitful   but what is important is how Cruz handled it. Basically, all it told us was that Ted Cruz is great at lying (not like we didn t already know that).Senator Cruz looked right at the camera and after giving out a jolly laugh, said: I like Donald. And   he s welcome to say whatever he likes. I like and respect him. That s all I got to say and right now its up to the voters to decide. He likes and respects him? How can that even be believable for a second? He didn t even say it sarcastically. No wonder nobody likes Ted Cruz; he doesn t even respect himself with the truth.While it s commendable that Ted Cruz would not resort to any further attacks, he s doing a greater disservice by lending further legitimacy to a guy that deserves ZERO political respect from the voters. And   he didn t even mean it. Next thing you know this clip will be used in another campaign ad by Trump as proof that he s a  respectable guy.  Yet   he s nowhere close to it. Ted Cruz needs to grow some balls.While it is true that Cruz and Trump had a bromance before Ted Cruz started rising in the polls, whatever love and affection they had for each other effectively ended when Donald began attacking him below the belt in every way imaginable. How can Ted Cruz respect someone who just a few weeks ago referred to him a  nasty guy.  The full quote is much, much worse than that: Look, the truth is, he s a nasty guy. He was so nice to me. I mean, I knew it. I was watching. I kept saying,  Come on Ted. Let s go, okay.  But he s a nasty guy. Nobody likes him. Nobody in Congress likes him. Nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him. He s a very  - he s got an edge that s not good. You can t make deals with people like that and it s not a good thing.

"January 29, 2017","In what can only be seen as a groundbreaking and unprecedented move, Starbucks chairman and CEO Howard Schultz delivered an open letter to all their partners (employees) regarding Donald Trump s Muslim ban.He titled the letter,  Living Our Values In Uncertain Times  and here it is: Dear partners,I write to you today with deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise. Let me begin with the news that is immediately in front of us: we have all been witness to the confusion, surprise and opposition to the Executive Order that President Trump issued on Friday, effectively banning people from several predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, including refugees fleeing wars. I can assure you that our Partner Resources team has been in direct contact with the partners who are impacted by this immigration ban, and we are doing everything possible to support and help them to navigate through this confusing period.We are living in an unprecedented time, one in which we are witness to the conscience of our country, and the promise of the American Dream, being called into question. These uncertain times call for different measures and communication tools than we have used in the past. Kevin and I are going to accelerate our commitment to communicating with you more frequently, including leveraging new technology platforms moving forward. I am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack, and want to use a faster, more immediate form of communication to engage with you on matters that concern us all as partners.I also want to take this opportunity to announce specific actions we are taking to reinforce our belief in our partners around the world and to ensure you are clear that we will neither stand by, nor stand silent, as the uncertainty around the new Administration s actions grows with each passing day:Support for DACA: As I wrote to Senators Graham and Durbin this week, we are enthusiastically behind their work to support  Dreamers  across our country   including those young men and women who are part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. There are nearly three quarters of a million hardworking people contributing to our communities and our economy because of this program. At Starbucks, we are proud to call them partners and to help them realize their own American Dream. We want them to feel welcome and included in our success, which is why we reimburse them for the biennial fee they must pay to stay in the program and why we have offered DACA-related services at our Opportunity Youth hiring fairs.Hiring Refugees: We have a long history of hiring young people looking for opportunities and a pathway to a new life around the world. This is why we are doubling down on this commitment by working with our equity market employees as well as joint venture and licensed market partners in a concerted effort to welcome and seek opportunities for those fleeing war, violence, persecution and discrimination. There are more than 65 million citizens of the world recognized as refugees by the United Nations, and we are developing plans to hire 10,000 of them over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks does business. And we will start this effort here in the U.S. by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support.Building Bridges, Not Walls, With Mexico: We have been open for business in Mexico since 2002, and have since opened almost 600 stores in 60 cities across the country, which together employ over 7,000 Mexican partners who proudly wear the green apron. We have sourced coffee from Mexico s producers and their families for three decades and last fall, we also announced the creation of a farmer support center in Chiapas to help accelerate our collective ability to grow and export some of the world s finest coffees from this important growing region, while donating more than $2 million to support the livelihood, food security and water quality of coffee producing communities in Oaxaca. With the support of thousands of Starbucks partners and millions of customers, we have also donated over a million coffee trees to support 70,000 families, and we will be expanding the initiative this year to generate another 4 million tree donations. Coffee is what unites our common heritage, and as I told Alberto Torrado, the leader of our partnership with Alsea in Mexico, we stand ready to help and support our Mexican customers, partners and their families as they navigate what impact proposed trade sanctions, immigration restrictions and taxes might have on their business and their trust of Americans. But we will continue to invest in this critically important market all the same.Our Healthcare Commitment to You: Finally, let me restate what we have recently communicated with you about the Affordable Care Act   our commitment remains that if you are benefits eligible, you will always have access to health insurance through Starbucks. Many of you have expressed concerns that recent government actions may jeopardize your ability to participate in the Affordable Care Act. If the recent Executive Order related to health care remains in place and the Affordable Care Act is repealed causing you to lose your healthcare coverage, you will always have the ability to return and can do so within 30 days of losing that coverage rather than having to wait for an open enrollment period. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Benefits Center at 877-728-9236.In the face of recent events around the world, let me assure you that we will stay true to our values and do everything we can possibly do to support and invest in every partner s well-being while taking the actions that are squarely within our ability to control. This is our focus: providing a Third Place of respite for those around the world who seek it, daily.Starbucks has and will always stand for opportunity   opportunity for our young people who are working to land their first job in the 75 countries where we do business, opportunity for our farmers who care so deeply for the highest of quality coffee we offer to customers all around the globe, and yes, opportunity for those who come to America in search of their own fresh start   whether that is with Starbucks directly, or through our suppliers or our partner companies.If there is any lesson to be learned over the last year, it s that your voice and your vote matter more than ever. We are all obligated to ensure our elected officials hear from us individually and collectively. Starbucks is doing its part; we need you to use the collective power of your voices to do the same while respecting the diverse viewpoints of the 90 million customers who visit our stores in more than 25,000 locations around the world.So, while we seek to understand what the new Administration s policies mean for us and our business both domestically and around the world, I can assure you that we will do whatever it takes to support you, our partners, to realize your own dreams and achieve your own opportunities. We are in business to inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time   whether that neighborhood is in a Red State or a Blue State; a Christian country or a Muslim country; a divided nation or a united nation. That will not change. You have my word on that.Onward,Howard Well said, Mr. Schultz, and you are a better American for all that was said. Your dedication to what truly makes America the land of the free and the home of the brave will forever be noticed.Featured Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images", CEO Of Starbucks Sends Giant F**K YOU To Trump In Groundbreaking Open Letter
"January 3, 2016","Thus far, the Oregon militia members who have occupied the federal building of a wildlife reserve are facing absolutely no threat of action being taken against them by government officials. Nonetheless, at least one of them has admitted that  he actually went to join these domestic terrorists with the intention of dying in a standoff, and subsequent statements and actions have shown that the others are likely thinking along those same lines. For instance, at least one of the militiamen has actually taken the time to film and upload a goodbye video to his family and other loved ones. While the videos are serious and tearful to the right-wing loons, they are nothing short of hilarious to those of us who aren t completely insane. Here is the one from known domestic terrorist and Muslim hater Jon Ritzheimer: Honestly, if this loon cared about his children that much, he d realize that missing the entire holiday season for this nonsense is doing them a tremendous disservice. All in the name of  what? Wanting to be above the law? Wanting to die as some kind of  free man?  I don t think that means what he thinks it means.Take your meds and go home, Mr. Ritzheimer. Even if you don t die there, you ll likely spend a lengthy stretch of time in federal prison for these ridiculous antics. Either way, your children need you home, not out terrorizing and occupying government facilities. If you knew anything about being a good father, you d know that.

"January 30, 2016","If you re a guy who thinks sending unwelcome d*ck pics to women is cool, you better hope you ve never sent one to this model.Emily Sears is a model from Australia who often shares pictures of herself on social media, and because of her job, men often send her pictures of their junk even though she really would rather they didn t. I usually receive at least one or two d*ck pics per day, at minimum,  Sears told BuzzFeed.  It s just been consistently happening for so long. I became absolutely fed up with these kinds of disturbing and disgusting messages and comments online. Rather than allow gross men to continue sending her unsolicited pictures of their penises, Emily decided to fight back in the best way possible.Emily noticed that whenever these men sent d*ck pics to her, they did so using their social media profiles. So she looked at the profiles to see if these men had girlfriends, wives, or mothers who she could inform about the pictures.She then sends a message to the guys complete with images of the women in their lives and asks what they would think if she alerted them to the unsolicited photos. We send the photos as a reminder for them to have respect for women. I think it provides an accountability that people seem to lose online; being behind a screen gives people a false sense of anonymity. I have noticed since posting my responses as a warning that the number has been significantly lower. I think my followers are slowly getting the message. After realizing that Emily figuratively had them by the balls, the men would claim that they were sorry and said they wouldn t do it again.Here s a couple of samples of messages between Emily and the men who harassed her.And sometimes, she went ahead and informed the women in their lives anyway, since most of the creepy guys are just sorry they got busted. Their apologies always seem fake,  Emily said.  Sometimes they try and say their friend stole their phone, and that it wasn t them. I don t believe they re sorry so much as they re sorry you re putting them on blast. And because they are fighting back and holding men accountable for their actions, more harassment usually follows. But Emily has no plans to stop outing men who send her unwelcome pictures of their d*cks. I get messages from men who say we re  sluts who are asking for it , which can get pretty overwhelming. But I truly believe its a huge social problem reflecting the attitude many men have towards women and I want to keep trying to fight against it. Frankly, these men deserve what they get. Men need to understand that there are consequences and just because you re using the Internet, it doesn t mean you are anonymous. Apparently, men need to be taught these facts. And they definitely need to learn that sending dick pics to women is not okay.As long as there are women like Emily Sears around, that lesson will continue to be taught.In other words, keep it your pants, gentlemen.Featured Image: Instagram", Model Outs Men To Their Moms & Wives After They Send Her Gross Illicit Pics
"January 30, 2017","Ah, Trump and voter fraud. The subject that he can t let go because, on his warped planet, he s so beloved by everyone that there s no way he lost the popular vote. Donald Trump is just not a loser in any way, shape or form. So why is it that so many people around him are guilty or caught up in one of the things he himself decries: Being registered to vote in more than one state? His chief strategist, Steve Bannon, is guilty of that, which is bad enough.What s worse is that the person Trump is getting his  3 million people voted illegally and if it weren t for them I d have won everything  information from is likewise registered to vote in multiple states.The Associated Press has learned that Gregg Phillips, who praised True the Vote for allegedly uncovering  thousands of duplicate records and registrations of dead people,  is registered to vote in Alabama, Texas, and Mississippi. Three states.This is proof that voter fraud is rampant? Har de har har don t make us laugh too hard. It hurts.Now,  Gregg Phillips  isn t exactly a unique name. What the AP found, though, was that all three of these registrations had identical Social Security numbers. That makes it a little harder to claim that these registrations are to three different people who all happen to have the same name.This is the guy who tweeted, back in November, that he had evidence of three million people voting illegally and then never provided or published said evidence, but Trump jumped on it anyway, which is dangerous as hell.Phillips is on Twitter now, pretending that it s voter fraud in every case except for his:AP just wrote and said I am still registered to vote in MS, a place I haven t lived for 20 years. Makes my point, elections are broken.  Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) January 30, 2017While that s a fair point, what Phillips totally fails to mention (because of course he does) is that it also illustrates the fact that being registered to vote in multiple states isn t indicative of voter fraud at all. Instead, it shows that the states aren t psychic. Most people registered to vote in multiple states didn t do that intentionally   they moved away (or died) and the states didn t realize that.All these people vote multiple times except for the two anal pustules known as Trump and Phillips.Sure. Right. There is no proof there, and if Trump wants to pretend there is, then he s got to find better evidence than one man who s registered to vote in three states.Trump and his little bestie here (at least, insofar as voter fraud is concerned) need to shut their goddamn mouths on this once and for all.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images", Trump’s Voter Fraud ‘Expert’ Just DISPROVED His Own Voter Fraud Argument In The Most Ironic Way Possible
"January 31, 2016","A Republican state senator in Utah believes that porn is such a threat to public health that he is proposing legislation to make the state take his aversion to skin flicks official. Whatever happened to limited government?Sen. Todd Weiler introduced his legislation on Friday, asking that the state recognize that porn is creating a public health hazard. He called for a reform to take on the  pornography epidemic that is harming the citizens of Utah and the nation. The politician told the Daily News that porn was more addictive than powerful drugs, and the public needed to start seeing adult films as a national epidemic. I have read books and I have experts tell me pornography is more difficult to overcome than cocaine,  he said.Weiler, 48, compares public attitudes on adult films in 2016 to early 20th century feelings about cigarettes, where doctors openly smoked and airplanes had smoking sections. He believes that his legislation will help to shift public opinion.The state senator made another strange comparison in an interview with a newspaper. Despite most Republican conservatives denying the existence of climate change, Weiler said denying the negative health effects of adult films was like denying climate science:  These are scientific facts, just like global warming. The legislator cited his experience as a divorce lawyer in providing him with an expert, insider point of view on the purported destruction that adult material can inflict on married couples.Weiler did draw a line in the sand for his proposed bill:  We re not going to outlaw masturbation in Utah. Even in a religiously conservative state like Utah, Weiler probably faces an uphill challenge in changing public attitudes. The state ranks as the #1 buyer of adult films in a 2009 survey, and a Harvard study showed that more than 5 out of every 1,000 households in Uitah paid for adult content online.

"January 31, 2017","On Tuesday, Donald Trump announced the identity of his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. At first glance, Trump s pick appears to be a typical, hardworking Aryan man who pledges to uphold the Constitution. Unfortunately, he is not the man he pretends to be.The Denver Post notes that Gorsuch is best known for siding against reason and sanity in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores. On top of that, he feels that anything related to Christianity   including attempts to use the religion as a shield while a bigoted corporation denies women full access to their healthcare options   is above  secular courts. It is not for secular courts to rewrite the religious complaint of a faithful adherent, or to decide whether a religious teaching about complicity imposes  too much  moral disapproval on those only  indirectly  assisting wrongful conduct,  Gorsuch wrote in his opinion. Ultimately, the then conservative-heavy Supreme Court ruled in favor of corporations  right to deprive people to healthcare options if they slap a Bible verse next to their explanation of their decision. Gorsuch also sided with a Catholic organization in another anti-Obamacare case. Judge Gorsuch has a record of ruling in a way that does not reflect Colorado values on reproductive rights. This is a pro-choice state that supports the constitutional right to abortion enshrined in Roe v. Wade and the right to privacy enshrined in Griswold v. Connecticut   beliefs that are contradicted in Judge Gorsuch s ruling in Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters,  Karen Middleton, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado, said following Trump s announcement. Colorado has a long, bipartisan history of supporting reproductive rights. Judge Gorsuch does not reflect the will of our state or the constitutional rights of American women and we would oppose his nomination. It s not just Colorado whose values Gorsuch doesn t reflect. A full 89 percent of Americans say that birth control is morally acceptable, compared to 72 percent who say the same about divorce and 13 percent who are in favor of cloning human. He and Trump may be in the minority, but nevertheless Gorsuch has taken his first step toward a lifetime position where he can continue to push his poisonous views and agenda.It might seem like an attractive idea to hope that Gorsuch will do his job well, but we cannot gamble with a lifetime position. It is up to us as Americans to demand that our elected officials say  no  to this man, who clearly is unable to think rationally wherever  moral  issues are concerned.Featured Image via Getty Images/Alex wong"," Trump’s SCOTUS Pick Sided With Hobby Lobby Against Women, Thinks Christianity Trumps ‘Secular Courts’"
"January 4, 2016","How much money does it take for a foreign nation to buy a United States Senator? Just ask Republican Tom Cotton.For a lousy $1 million paycheck, Israel hired Cotton to lead an effort to sabotage the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama Administration toiled for months to achieve.Bill Kristol s Emergency Committee for Israel donated to Cotton s senatorial campaign and not long after taking office, Cotton penned a letter signed by 47 of his colleagues to Iranian leaders in an attempt to get them to abandon the negotiations by warning that a Republican president will not honor any deal struck.His effort to sabotage important diplomatic negotiations even drew criticism from a former Army General who expressed disappointment because as a former veteran himself, Cotton should know better than to undermine the Commander-in-Chief.In July, Cotton continued his effort by comparing Secretary of State John Kerry and the Iran Deal to Pontius Pilate and the crucifixion of Jesus.Then Cotton openly made an oath to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a trip to Israel in which he pledged his allegiance to Israel and vowed to sabotage the Iran deal. Today s meeting only reaffirms my opposition to this deal,  Cotton announced.  I will stand with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israel and work with my colleagues in Congress to stop this deal and to ensure that Israel has the means to defend itself against Iran and its terrorist surrogates. And this perfectly illustrates how Israel got Republicans to turn against their own country, and is fitting since a recent NSA leak has revealed that Israel did, indeed, bribe GOP members of Congress to rail against the Iran deal.As Addicting Info reported last week,A U.S. intelligence official who was involved in managing the NSA intercepts said Israel s communications with Republicans included such questions as:  How can we get your vote? What s it going to take?  What further denial of treason can be made by either Republicans or Israel at this point?Clearly, Israel successfully bought their new puppets considering Republicans crusaded against the deal for months. And the fact that America s broken campaign finance laws gave Israel the secret opportunity to donate to campaigns like Cotton s only makes Republican and Israeli treachery all the more credible.Cotton got a million dollars for his campaign from an Israel Super PAC and then went to work for his Israeli overlords to sabotage American foreign policy.Sometimes, it really is that simple.Featured Image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)", Tom Cotton Accepted $1 Million From Israel To Sabotage Iran Nuclear Deal

Most people would just brush that off. Hell, I ve been called worse and I m not even famous. But Woods, like Trump, apparently can t brush anything off. He sued the anonymous Twitter user for $10 million.The defendant s attorney filed a motion that argued that his client was exercising his First Amendment right, just like Woods is when he insults people. Plus, as a public figure, Woods has to work a lot harder to prove defamation.The defendant soon dropped the appeal, to which Woods tweeted,  The slime who libeled me just dropped his appeal contesting my victorious SLAPP motion.  What Woods didn t know at the time was that the appeal was drooped because the defendant died.Woods, though, undeterred, took it a step way too far: Learn this,  he said in a tweet that has since been deleted.

This is a significant step forward in our ability to recover the millions in damages caused by John Doe s cowardly tweet,  Woods s attorney told The Hollywood Reporter.  It also sends a message to others who believe they can hide behind the anonymity of online social media to falsely accuse public figures of heinous behavior without recourse to themselves.

WFTV reports that the unnamed child was riding in his grandfather s pickup truck when grandpa parked and ran inside the family s home, leaving the little boy to his own devices. Grandpa, whose name has not been released, also left his gun behind   because what s the point in being irresponsible if you re not going to go all-out?The grandfather says he left the little boy playing with some tools in the back seat, but the child managed to climb into the front of the truck, where Granddaddy kept his .32-caliber Kel-Tec gun. The gun was  responsibly  kept in a holster, but the child removed it and shot himself in the cheek, near his eye. The boy was airlifted to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, where he remains in critical condition. They are talking to individuals that were at the residence, possibly in the residence and we have forensics out gathering some evidence,  said Twis Lizasuain, Osceola County Sheriff s Office media relations director, who noted that evidence thus far suggests the discharge was  accidental    a word we too often hear when one of the  good guys with guns  shoots a child or, through negligence, allows a child to shoot him or herself.

"January 5, 2017","A secret report from U.S. intelligence agencies, which was revealed through a senior government official, shows that the top tier of the Russian government had a big celebration when Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. The report from the Washington Post confirms earlier information and data about the Russian reaction.Senior officials in the Russian government celebrated Donald Trump s victory over Hillary Clinton as a geopolitical win for Moscow, according to U.S. officials who said that American intelligence agencies intercepted communications in the aftermath of the election in which Russian officials congratulated themselves on the outcome.The ebullient reaction among high-ranking Russian officials   including some who U.S. officials believe had knowledge of the country s cyber campaign to interfere in the U.S. election   contributed to the U.S. intelligence community s assessment that Moscow s efforts were aimed at least in part at helping Trump win the White House.A picture continues to emerge around the Russian effort to meddle in the election to get the outcome they wanted. Earlier reports sourced to multiple U.S. intelligence agencies show that the Russians, under Vladimir Putin, employed hackers to break into the accounts of multiple figures associated with the Democratic Party. Most particularly, the hackers went after John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton 2016 campaign and long-time Clinton ally. After they got into his emails, they passed them along to the team at WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks is headed by Julian Assange, who long has held a grudge against Sec. Clinton, President Obama, and the United States. The Podesta emails were then released by WikiLeaks and timed specifically to be repeatedly featured in national headlines for weeks on end.Those leaks were used by Trump and the Trump campaign as fodder for an effort to attack Clinton s character and honesty, which, when coupled with other campaign coverage and missteps, helped to hurt her approval ratings and votes.Despite these revelations, Trump has refused to accept the information as uncovered by the CIA and other agencies. Instead, Trump has sided with the Russian government and WikiLeaks over the U.S. government that he will lead in two weeks. He has blamed the Democrats for not making their servers secure enough, and even argued that couriers should be used instead of electronic communications.While some Republicans have bucked their party leader over Russian interference, and, along with Democrats, pushed the Senate to establish an independent investigation like those used with Watergate and Benghazi to look into Russian interference, the majority of Republicans have followed Trump in minimizing Russian interference, preferring instead to keep up attacks on Democrats.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons", Secret Report: Top Russians Celebrated Trump Win

Moore was born and raised in Flint, MI. His first documentary film, Roger & Me, chronicles the downfall of Flint and explains how its demise was orchestrated by big business and conservative policy.Moore posted a photo of himself on social media that shows him holding a pair of handcuffs. In his other hand, Moore is holding up a sign which reads, #ArrestGovSnyder. Activists have been using the hash tag to call attention to Flint s water crisis, and Snyder s culpability in the matter.https://www.facebook.com/mmflint/photos/a.10150288227701857.331023.24674986856/10153223367636857/?type=3&theaterAccompanying the photo, is a letter written by Moore condemning Snyder over the crisis. Moore Writes: Dear Governor Snyder:Thanks to you, sir, and the premeditated actions of your administrators, you have effectively poisoned, not just some, but apparently ALL of the children in my hometown of Flint, Michigan.And for that, you have to go to jail.To poison all the children in an historic American city is no small feat. Even international terrorist organizations haven t figured out yet how to do something on a magnitude like this.By taking away the city s clean drinking water in order to  cut costs,  and then switching the city s water supply to Flint River water, you have allowed massively unsafe levels of pollutants and lead into the water that travels in to everyone s home. Every Flint resident is trapped by this environmental nightmare which you, Governor, have created. Moore argues that Snyder is a criminal, and should be arrested for switching the city s water source to the Flint River, which caused the contamination. Moore argues: Like any real criminal, when you were confronted with the truth (by the EPA and other leading water experts across America), you denied what you did. Even worse, you decided to mock your accusers and their findings. As I said, I know you don t like to believe in a lot of science (after all, you used to run Gateway Computers, and that, really, is all anyone needs to know about you), but this time the science has caught up with you   and this time, I hope, it s going to convict you.

"January 8, 2016","There s something stirring in the Deep South that is reminiscent of when the South decided they were going to throw a hissy fit and secede from the union for not being allowed to own people as property. Some states feel that they shouldn t have to follow federal law and believe states  rights supersede the laws of the federal government.Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R), knowing in his heart of hearts that while he doesn t like that the federal government holds supremacy over the states, due to this little thing called Article 6 Section 2 of the United States Constitution, has decided to release a plan to change the Constitution. This is in an effort to change the rule of law in the United States and prohibit Congress, the Supreme Court and the president from regulating states. He seems to be calling forth for their to be an overthrow of the government by the states who don t agree with the Constitution as it is written so that they can have their own set of rules and laws.Abbott, in a bit of word play claims to have unveiled constitutional amendments to  restore the rule of law.  However, it seems he would rather not have federal law at all. Honestly? The next step after this would be secession. It looks like Abbott may be on the verge of wanting to start another Civil War.Abbott, with his own interpretation of the Constitution put out a press release that stated:Governor Greg Abbott today delivered the keynote address at the Texas Public Policy Foundation s Annual Policy Orientation where he unveiled his Texas Plan to restore the Rule of Law and return the Constitution to its intended purpose. In his plan, Governor Abbott offers nine constitutional amendments to rein in the federal government and restore the balance of power between the States and the United States. The Governor proposes achieving the constitutional amendments through a Convention Of States. The increasingly frequent departures from Constitutional principles are destroying the Rule of Law foundation on which this country was built,  said Governor Abbott.  We are succumbing to the caprice of man that our Founders fought to escape. The cure to these problems will not come from Washington D.C. Instead, the states must lead the way. To do that I am adding another item to the agenda next session. I want legislation authorizing Texas to join other states in calling for a Convention of States to fix the cracks in our Constitution. Governor Abbott went on to explain that dysfunction in Washington, D.C. stems largely from the federal government s refusal to follow the Constitution. Congress routinely violates its enumerated powers, while taxing and spending its way from one financial crisis to another. The President exceeds his executive powers to impose heavy-handed regulations. And the Supreme Court imposes its policy views under the guise of judicial interpretation. Governor Abbott urged action by Texas   and other states   to restore the Rule of Law in America.Governor Abbott offered the following constitutional amendments:Prohibit Congress from regulating activity that occurs wholly within one State.Require Congress to balance its budget.Prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from creating federal law.Prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from preempting state law.Allow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a U.S. Supreme Court decision.Require a seven-justice super-majority vote for U.S. Supreme Court decisions that invalidate a democratically enacted law.Restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments by limiting the former to the powers expressly delegated to it in the Constitution.Give state officials the power to sue in federal court when federal officials overstep their bounds.Allow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a federal law or regulation.The full plan can be found here.The one who seems to not want to follow the Constitution is Gov. Abbott himself. If he did he wouldn t want to amend the Constitution as it is written. He s trying to overthrow the government by stripping federal authority away from every aspect of our government as it stands today. He wants to be able to throw out decisions made by all three branches of our federal government. If this isn t treason, I don t know what is.What Abbott doesn t seem to realize is that in a nation where everyone gets a vote to elect in who they want as lawmakers, THAT is how we can change federal laws. We don t throw a hissy fit over certain laws that don t fit with the criteria of what you want for your specific state. That s what the South did before the Civil War when they wanted to own humans as property, and that what he seems to want now to overthrow any gun regulation or marriage equality. What he is proposing is going against the very fabric that makes us the United States of America. The South lost then, and he will lose now.It looks as though Abbott is trying to be the next Jefferson Davis and lead a new brand of Confederate States.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)", Governor Of Texas Unveils Detailed Plan To OVERTHROW The Federal Government
"January 8, 2017","Viola Davis said that the issue of racial tensions in America now that Donald Trump has been elected really boils down to one fundamental question, which has more to do with who we are as a nation than who Trump is as a person.Speaking backstage at the Golden Globes on Sunday night, Davis was asked how we can ensure that the progress made over the years, especially in regards to racial tensions, isn t lost under a Trump presidency. Her response was spot on.Davis said that she would begin her answer by  removing Trump from the equation.  She went on to explain that  it s bigger than him. I believe that it is our responsibility to uphold what it is to be an American and what America is about and what the true meaning of what it means to pursue the American dream. I think that America in and of itself has been an affirmation, But I think that we have fallen short a lot,  Davis said. Because, there is no way that we can have anyone in office that is not an extension of our own belief system. So then what does that say about us? And I think that, if you answer that question, I think that that says it all. So just what does Trump s election say about America?

"January 9, 2016","Jon Ritzheimer, infamous right-wing terrorist and incredible douchebag, barely squeaks by on his government disability check and has said that he is  thankful to have a wife who works.  As it turns out, experts tell us that this guy who spends his days fighting imaginary battles and sucking up a good man s oxygen isn t the exception to the demographics that make up a right-wing terrorist militia, he s the definition. These guys are broke,  said Mark Pitcavage, who has been researching far-right movements for 22 years and has studied the Harney County occupiers.  Right-wing extremists, generally speaking, have very little money. How a right-wing extremist occupation like the one in Oregon would pay for itself isn t exactly an issue there s been a lot of data on. By referencing the research of people like Pitcavage, we can deduce that right-wing extremists are for the most part freeloaders, likened to teenagers who think they can take care of themselves but overwhelmed the first time they have to pay a bill or do a load of laundry. It s quite possible that a lot of them will get tired and feel the pressure to go back and care for their families,  Pitcavage explained. Those families, left behind to care for themselves, are probably better off without their  patriarch,  the almighty man who controls everything and can make the decision to just pack up and leave on a whim to occupy a forest a thousand miles away that they ve never heard of before last week.Daryl Johnson, a former DHS domestic terrorism analyst, says militia members have a warped sense of priority where their duty  is concerned. A video released by Ritzheimer showed him crying that he would probably be killed and how much he would miss his family just before he held up a copy of the Constitution and declared  But I took an oath. They ll think nothing about taking half their paycheck and using half of it to buy ammunition and guns,  Johnson told The Oregonian.The gist here is that these idiots aren t just the worst the American gene pool has to offer, they re also incredible assholes who are neglecting their families to go play soldier in the Oregon wilderness. They re holed up in a facility they didn t pay to be at, squeezing the taxpayer for their utilities and costing tens if not hundreds of thousands more in wages paid to employees who can t go to work.The sooner these imbeciles are removed and incarcerated the better off the country   and their families   will be.Featured image via thetruthaboutguns.com", Experts: ‘Militiamen’ Live Hand To Mouth On Gov’t Disability And Their Wives’ Hard Work

"Jul 1, 2016","Is it possible that Bill s latest move could ve just sealed Hillary s fate? It actually makes perfect sense. Bill and Hillary Clinton have spent their entire lives trying to figure out how to game the system. Is it possible that Bill has actually  one-upped  Hillary this time, putting the kibosh on her political aspirations, leaving him with millions from her Wall Street speeches and their home in Chappaqua, New York; minus his cantankerous, scheming,  lying, screeching and (according to former secret service agents) sometimes violent wife?Back in April, Slate s Michelle Goldberg offered the Hillary Clinton campaign some sage advice:  Fire Bill Clinton. The Clinton campaign declined to take her suggestion, but perhaps they should give it another look.Bill Clinton is one of the most talented politicians of the past century, but his infallible skills continue to fail him when put in the service of someone other than himself.On Monday, Clinton was on a tarmac in Phoenix when he learned that the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, would soon be on the same tarmac. He delayed his flight so he could try to meet with her. He asked for a meeting, boarded her plane and chatted for about 30 minutes.On Friday, MSNBC s Jonathan Capehart asked Lynch if there was one important thing she wished former Attorney General Eric Holder had told her.  Where the lock on the plane door was,  Lynch deadpanned.(Meanwhile, Republicans are calling for an independent prosecutor, which is rich: there isn t enough time to confirm a Supreme Court justice, but plenty of time for Ken Starr to ride into town again.)On its face, it was wrong to do, and Democrats would be savaging Republicans if the situation were reversed. It raises one of two possibilities: Either Bill Clinton is an idiot or he wants his wife to lose. I wonder if there s a part of Bill Clinton that doesn t really want Hillary Clinton to become president, particularly if she has to distance herself from his legacy to do so,  wondered Goldberg back in April, listing a bill of idiotic particulars.  How else to explain why one of the world s most talented and agile politicians is so consistently flat-footed and destructive when advocating on his wife s behalf? The fallout from the meeting was predictable: Lynch has said she regrets sitting down with Clinton and wouldn t do it again, given a do-over. And she has said that she will not overrule career prosecutors if they recommend an indictment. Whatever decision the Justice Department ends up making is now clouded in (even more) suspicion.And perhaps the greatest damage was done to Lynch. It must be awfully difficult to turn down a meeting request from a former president, the spouse of the likely future president, especially for somebody who may have future political ambitions. Did Lynch have aspirations for the Supreme Court? If so, what Clinton just did casts a pall over whatever chance she had.Via:  Huffington Post","LIBERAL HUFFINGTON POST HEADLINE: “Man, Bill Clinton Is An Idiot”…Is Bill Intentionally Trying To Put Hillary Behind Bars?"

He even brought up slavery, Jim Crow and  history of oppression . It was about salving his own issues, as always, not recognizing the event he was at, a memorial for the five officers. He did mention them, but spent most of the time imploring people to recognize their racism.   Weasel ZippersPresident Obama defended the Black Lives Matter movement Tuesday at a memorial service for five slain Dallas police officers, saying bigotry remains in police departments across the U.S. While paying tribute to the fallen officers for sacrificing their lives to protect others from a sniper, Mr. Obama also called on law enforcement agencies to root out bigotry.

Five empty seats in the arena were adorned with folded U.S. flags and duty-officer hats to signify their loss.The president, who has been criticized by law-enforcement officials for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, said Americans  cannot simply turn away and dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers or paranoid. We can t simply dismiss it as a symptom of political correctness or reverse racism,  he said.HERE is part of Obama s embarrassing speech. The speech in its entirety can be found below:Former President George W. Bush, a resident of the Dallas area, said the nation is proud of the slain officers. Our police chief and police department have been mighty inspirations for the rest of the nation,  Mr. Bush said.  These slain officers were the best among us.

We recognize that we are brothers and sisters, sharing the same brief moment on earth,  Mr. Bush said.  We do not want the unity of grief, nor do we want the unity of fear.

"Jul 14, 2015","Last we checked harvesting and selling body parts in America was illegal. Perhaps the abortion industry has some sort of special exception since killing babies is such an important service to Americans In the gruesome and now viral video that shows a Planned Parenthood medical officer talking to undercover actors posing as biotech entrepreneurs about the prospects of buying fetal body parts, the name of one company pops up several times:In the context of selling aborted fetal tissue, Dr. Deborah Nucatola is seen and heard discussing her ongoing relationship with a company called StemExpress that works as the middleman between Planned Parenthood affiliates and research institutes that use the body parts in scientific experimentation.The video, provided by the pro-life group Center for Medical Progress, purports to show an actual online order form from StemExpress where buyers can order the parts they want and the age of gestation.The pull down menu shows  brain, heart, heart (veins and arteries attached), lungs, liver, liver and thymus, spleen, large intestine  and so on. The order form allows the buyer to choose the gestational age of the baby to be aborted from four weeks upward.StemExpress is a five-year old privately held for-profit business located in Placerville, California that describes itself as  a multi-million dollar company that supplies human blood, tissue products, primary cells and other clinical specimens to biomedical researchers.  The company says it  offers the largest variety of raw material in the industry, as well as fresh, fixed and cryopreserved human primary cells. StemExpress calls itself as  the only company of its kind to both procure tissues and isolate cells for researchers  individual needs in its own labs. Our human tissue products range from fetal to adult and healthy to diseased, and we also collect bone marrow and leukapheresis for isolation.  StemExpress promises that by partnering with them  you ll get the high quality samples you need so that you can focus on the research. Some will wonder how something that is apparently illegal goes on so openly. David Daleiden of the Center for Medical Progress told Breitbart News,  It is the Kermit Gosnell effect. There is simply a lack of interest in enforcing this kind of law because of abortion. On the video Nucatola is heard talking about pricing, that  specimens  would range from $30 to $100. It is expected that Planned Parenthood will claim these charges are merely for their services and do not include a profit. Daleiden told Breitbart News that there are no extra services because companies like StemExpress are there at the facility to harvest the organs on order and walk out with them, not even shipping charges.Daleiden said that while the practice goes on around the country, it is especially hard to prosecute in California because of the political power of the abortion industry.The buying and selling of human body parts is illegal under the U.S. Criminal Code though companies can charge for expenses. The question becomes how a  multi-million dollar  for-profit company buys fetal body parts and sells them but makes no profit.Repeated calls to StemExpress for a comment have gone unreturned.

"Jul 14, 2017","If you re not okay with taxpayers paying for exorbitant medical costs, including transgender surgeries for military members, you ll want to remember these names in 2018 A majority in the House voted down a proposal to restrict funding for transgender members of the military, standing by social policy changes enacted by the Pentagon under former President Barack Obama.Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., succeeded in forcing a vote, arguing that Obama s  transgender decision is costly in dollars and short on common sense.  The attempted rollback failed on a 209-214 vote, however, as 24 Republicans joined a unanimous Democratic caucus in opposing the proposal. The Obama transgender policy, which was implemented without input from members of Congress, is ill-conceived and contrary to our goals of increasing troop readiness and investing defense dollars into addressing budget shortfalls of the past,  Hartzler said in June.  By recruiting and allowing transgender individuals to serve in our military we are subjecting taxpayers to high medical costs including up to $130,000 per transition surgery, lifetime hormone treatments, and additional surgeries to address the high percentage of individuals who experience complications. Her amendment would have barred the Defense Department from  provid[ing] medical treatment (other than mental health treatment) related to gender transition  to members of the military. Proponents of transgender military service argued that her proposal  would reduce military readiness  by discouraging transgender Americans from serving. It would have a negative impact on morale, a negative impact on retention and move us away from the merit-based system which we now have, where we have one set of rules applied to everybody,  Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo., who co-chairs the LGBT Equality Caucus, said Wednesday.Hartzler maintained that her amendment would increase readiness, however.  The deployability of individuals going through the sex transition process is highly problematic, requiring 210 to 238 work days where a soldier is non-deployable after surgery,  she said.  This recovery time equates to 1.4 million manpower days where transgender personnel cannot deploy and fight our nation s wars, therefore relying on an already stressed force to pick up the burden. It makes no sense to purposely recruit individuals who cannot serve.   Washington ExaminerHere s the list of 24 Republicans who voted to keep Obama s transgender policy for our military in place that was implemented without input from members of Congress:Justin Amash (Michigan)Jack Bergman (Michigan)Mike Coffman (Colorado)Barbara Comstock (Virginia)Paul Cook (California)Ryan Costello (Pennsylvania)Carlos Curbelo (Florida)Jeff Denham (California)Charlie Dent (Pennsylvania)John Faso (New York)Brian Fitzpatrick (Pennsylvania)Darrell Issa (California)John Katko (New York)Steve Knight (California)Leonard Lance (New Jersey)Frank LoBiondo (New Jersey)Tom MacArthur (New Jersey)Brian Mast (Florida)Tom Reed (New York)Dave Reichert (Washington)Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Florida)Bill Shuster (Pennsylvania)Elise Stefanik (New York)Claudia Tenney (New York)h/t Truth Division",LIST OF 24 REPUBLICANS Who Voted “YES” To KEEP Obama’s Taxpayer-Funded Sex-Change Surgeries In Place For Transgenders In Military

It was emailed out and makes no reference to today s terror attack.See Below statement: Michelle and I would like to extend our warmest wishes to Muslims in the United States and around the world celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr. As Muslims mark the end of the month, they are reminded that Ramadan is a time to reflect spiritually, build communally, and aid those in need. While Eid marks the end of Ramadan, it marks a new beginning for each individual   a reason to celebrate and express gratitude on this holiday.For millions of Muslims, the morning of Eid is marked with the call to prayer echoing through cities and towns across the globe. Millions of people head to local mosques for special Eid prayers followed by festive gatherings, gift exchanges, and feasts among friends, neighbors and families. The diversity of traditions paint the vibrant images we see from around the world capturing the spirit and excitement of Eid   colorful dresses or white garments decorating the masses of people standing in lines for prayer, lanterns and ornaments lighting up bazaars and neighborhoods, intricate henna designs painted on hands of young girls and women, and an abundance of delectable foods and aromatic cuisines. As Muslim Americans celebrate Eid across America, the holiday is a reminder to every American of the importance of respecting those of all faiths and beliefs. This past year New York City Public Schools announced adding Eid to their official school calendars alongside Christmas, Hanukkah and other holidays   an acknowledgement of the great diversity and inclusiveness that adds to the richness of our nation. During this year s White House Iftar, I had the opportunity to meet inspiring young Muslim Americans who are leading efforts for greater understanding and unity across diverse communities. Following the Iftar, one of the young attendees helped spearhead an effort that raised more than $75,000 for the churches burned in the wake of the shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Americans of all faiths and beliefs must stand together to protect our democracy and strengthen our country as a whole.

"Jul 17, 2015","Just confirming what anyone paying attention already knew. The Huffington Post isn t interested in reporting the news they re strictly serving as a propaganda arm of the progressive left Earlier this month, while political news organizations were wrestling with the rise of Donald Trump, Washington Post senior politics editor Steven Ginsberg offered a philosophy:  In my view, making decisions solely according to who may win the nomination is the worst way to cover a presidential election,  he said.  A whole lot happens on the way to the nomination and you can t explain what s happening with the candidates or the country without being on top of all of it. Since then, Trump s influence in the Republican primary has only grown. He has surged to the front of the pack, leading his rivals by 3 points in the most recent Fox News and USA Today/Suffolk polls, respectively. He has raised issues that have resonated with conservative voters and forced other GOP candidates to come forward on where they stand. It is very likely that he will appear near center-stage at the inaugural Republican debate, on Aug. 6, and lead the pile-on against Jeb Bush.In other words, Trump is a major character in this chapter of the 2016 presidential election story. And as Ginsberg said,  you can t explain what s happening with the candidates or the country without being on top of all of it. On Friday, however, the Huffington Post s politics team announced that they would no longer cover the candidate as a political story. After watching and listening to Donald Trump since he announced his candidacy for president, we have decided we won t report on Trump s campaign as part of The Huffington Post s political coverage. Instead, we will cover his campaign as part of our Entertainment section,  they wrote.  Our reason is simple: Trump s campaign is a sideshow. We won t take the bait. If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you ll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette. A quick fact-check: 1. Huffington Post is taking the bait, because they re continuing to cover Trump and will continue to benefit from the clicks. 2. Trump s campaign isn t a sideshow. He s leading the field, and is therefore a daily preoccupation for other candidates. (Hours after posting its note, Huffington Post sent an email clarifying that  the impact [Trump is] having on the Republican Party and the immigration debate is itself a real thing,  which it will cover  as substance, but anything that tumbles out of his mouth will land on the Entertainment page. )One might conclude that Huffington Post s announcement amounts to the same Trump-style grandstanding they claim to condemn. On a larger level, they seem to miss the point that all politics is theater. Countless statements have tumbled forth from the mouth of candidates   top-tier and third-tier   that were made precisely to rile up the base, bait an opponent, get free play in the media, etc. The Huffington Post politics team has covered these stories, and will almost surely continue to do so   even when they come from candidates who have a less of a shot at their party s nomination than Trump.Via: Politico",HUFFING TON POST WON’T COVER REPUBLICAN FRONTRUNNER DONALD TRUMP’S CAMPAIGN
"Jul 17, 2016","This cop killer was a hateful, racist sub-human. He not only hated white people and cops, he bragged about it. The scary thing is, much like ISIS, who has no trouble recruiting people with hate in their hearts, there are no shortage of people to carry out Obama s war on cops in America. These are terrorists and our very own  President  has inspired these people to act on their hate for Whites, for cops and for America. This, is Obama s real legacy The 29 year old ex-marine, Gavin Eugene Long, who ambushed and killed three unsuspecting Baton Rouge police officers on Sunday morning, hated those who did not share his skin-tone and harbored a particular hatred for the police. As revealed in the hours after the shootings, a Youtube account operated by Long under the handle I Am Cosmo where the alleged killer posted dozens of clips, provides insight into what motivated the young man to kill three police officers and wound three more on his 29th birthday.In the Youtube videos, Long rants against  crackers, and makes multiple references to the July 5th killing of Alton Sterling at the hands of police officers only five miles away from Sunday s attack. The videos also detail that Long is a member of the Nation of Islam, labelled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for its black supremacist and racist views towards Jews, Asians, and whites which the group s leaders argue have  sucked the blood from and exploited the black community.As Daily Caller details, the 29-year-old was a native of Kansas City, Missouri and was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2010 after reaching the rank of E-5. He preferred to go by the name Cosmo Ausar Setepenra rather than Gavin Eugene Long.In a video published on Thursday, the racist shooter says that  If I would have been there with Alton   Clap  before promoting a book that he wrote that discusses black liberation ideology.  I wrote it for my dark-skinned brothers,  said Long.  If you look at all the rebels like Black Panthers, Huey P. Newton, Malcolm X, and Elijah Muhammad, they was light-skinned. But we know how hard y all got it. https://youtu.be/kGuUq6eUoFwThe assailant also suggested that the black community should buy only from black-owned businesses rather than  working for the white people. In one video Long is heard lamented  working for the white people.  He encouraged one man riding in his vehicle as he filmed using a body camera to shop only at black-owned businesses. He brought up a hypothetical scenario in which a family member who wanted to buy carpet was forced to buy from non-black business owners saying    Who s she going to f  with?

Stelter calmly laid out a damning indictment of the mainstream media in the age of Trump Beautiful!Host Stelter pushed back trying to make the claim that the attacks on Trump are just harmless  opinion We all know and have watched the BRUTAL and BITTER editorializing from CNN and MSNBC. It s clearly more than that.HERE S A BIT OF THE TRANSCRIPT FROM THE KURSON/STELTER EXCHANGE:KEN KURSON: So the idea here is that the media has become the opposition to Trump. Just listening to the intro to this show, listening to Fareed s show before it, it s no longer that the Republican point of view holds forth, and the Democrats hold them accountable, and the media covers it. It s that the president and the White House put forth their point of view, the media argues with them, and the Democrats have become totally irrelevant to that discussion. It s a stunning thing to watch unfold during this presidency.BRIAN STELTER: About the irrelevancy of the Democratic party?KURSON: Totally! And the way the press has assigned itself the chore of undoing the results of this election, which they simply don t accept. And I think the shame of it is, we no longer have even a two-party system, which many think is too few. We have a one-party system, and the media as the other party.KURSON: During these breaks, when I watch you go on Twitter. The way journalists reward each other for stabbing and needling there s a new system of reward that is out there for journalists that has very little to do with policy and very little to do with advancing this country.STELTER: Where do you go from that to, the media is the opposition.KURSON: Because when I look at the tone, and the way these attacks are launched, and I ve cited a couple of examples for you, or the way that whenever there s a need for the appearance of balance, NPR will hire some conservative who hates the president. Or the New York Times will go get Bret Stephens, whose main contribution is that he hates the president.Whenever there s the need for the appearance of fairness, there s no real effort to   where are the pro-Trump journalists in the mainstream media? They don t exist! Because the entire mainstream media is against Trump. And that I think is not just bad for American policy. I think it s bad for journalism.STELTER: I think a lot of journalists are against lying, are against deceit. That s where we are right now.KURSON: I m against lying and deceit. I think the function of the journalist to hold the administration accountable is a critical function enshrined in our Bill of Rights. But when you have a system where the most outrageous attack is what s rewarded with likes on Facebook and followings on Twitter, you re setting yourself up.STELTER: Those are opinion columns! Those are opinion columns!KURSON: No, they re not just opinion columns. It s reporters. And they audition for each other, and they audition for popularity.Kurson couldn t be more right! Have you noticed that since the daily White House press briefings are not televised that the questions and tone from reporters has gotten so much calmer and less dramatic?

John McCain, 80, has been diagnosed with a primary glioblastoma, a type of brain tumor, Mayo Clinic doctors directly involved in the senator s care told CNN.The senator underwent surgery to remove a blood clot on Friday at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix. Lab results from that surgery confirmed the presence of glioblastoma associated with the blood clot.Glioblastoma is a particularly aggressive tumor that forms in the tissue of the brain and spinal cord, according to the American Brain Tumor Association.A pathologist was in the operating room during the procedure, a minimally invasive craniotomy with an eyebrow incision, said his doctor, who added that the surgery lasted about 3 to 4 hours. Post-surgical brain scans show the tissue causing concern has been completely removed.McCain is recovering  amazingly well,  according to a statement from his office.The senator showed no neurological problems before or after the operation, said his doctors. Though not identified by name, at McCain s request, his doctors were given permission speak with Gupta, who is also a practicing neurosurgeon.McCain is now recovering at his Arizona home. He and his family are considering treatment options, which will likely include radiation and chemotherapy, his doctors said.The surgical procedure McCain underwent is  a significant operation,  said Gupta, explaining that a bone underneath the eyebrow had to be removed to do the procedure and then later put back. It s a very aggressive tumor,  said Gupta. He explained that survival for malignant glioblastoma tends to be around 14 months with treatment, which could not begin until the incision heals, which would be in the next three or four weeks.However, a 2009 study reported that almost 10% of patients with glioblastoma may live five years or longer, according to the American Brain Tumor Association.

"Jul 2, 2016","Bravo! This woman is example of true courage. More Americans need to take a stand against anyone who attempts to silence their First Amendment right Whenever folks in Penfield, New York get a hankering for pancakes for lunch   they head over to the 5 Mile Caf .The family-owned restaurant is known in those parts for serving breakfast any time of the day (order their homemade corned beef hash).They are also known for their patriotism. We are very patriotic here at the caf    all year round  not just this time of year,  owner Jennifer Aquino told me.  We have American flags and patriotic things around the caf . So Jennifer decided to ask the town for a permit so she could post a  God Bless America  banner on the front of her restaurant. She wanted to display the banner from Memorial Day through Independence Day.There was just one significant problem.Penfield has a strict banner allotment policy. Businesses are only allowed to post banners for a total of three weeks out of the year. And Jennifer had used up her allotment. At one point we had banners all over the town and the town just looked trashy and our residents said enough s enough,  town supervisor Tony LaFountain told WHEC.Jennifer s request was denied.Instead of posting the banner outside the restaurant, she posted it inside. And that was that   until the Orlando terrorist attack. I decided on my way to work that I was going to put it up regardless of the town telling me I couldn t,  she said.  So I put it up. A bit later that day she received an email from the town telling her to remove the banner. They warned her that she could face a possible fine for violating the ordinance. I didn t take it down,  Jennifer told me.  And I was willing to pay the fine. The [message on the banner] means a lot to me   especially during this time in our country with all that s going on with terrorism,  she said.  I just can t believe that I can t have this banner up and be supported by the town board. The fact that I m being asked to take it down is wrong,  she said.  It s against my First Amendment rights. People need to open up their eyes. If we start letting them tell us we can t do this   it s going to get worse. Jennifer tells me she never imagined there would be a day like this in America. I have lots of veterans in my family,  she said.  I have a cousin who fought in Desert Storm so that we could have the freedom to hang a banner that says,  God bless America. And yet we live in a nation where you can be punished for simply being patriotic.Via: FOX News ",CAFE OWNER REACTS IN AWESOME WAY After Town Told Her To Remove “God Bless America” Banner From Front Of Restaurant
"Jul 2, 2017","Greg Gutfeld nailed how Americans feel right now about their place in the world.  America First  is the mantra that candidate Trump repeatedly spoke about in rally after rally. The globalists and establishment joined with Democrats to oppose Trump but he s a fearless soldier for America s return to greatness:  From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it s going to be only America First.    DJTIt s way past time to realize that world hatred of Trump is their problem, not ours Thank you Greg Gutfeld!JUST IN CASE YOU NEED A REFRESHER ON WHAT TRUMP PROMISED FOR AMERICAN:A transcript of Donald Trump s inaugural address, delivered Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, after his swearing-in as the 45th president of the United States.Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: Thank you.We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.We will face challenges, we will confront hardships but we will get the job done.Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michele Obama for their gracious aid in this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you.Today s ceremony has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or one party to another but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.For too long a small group in our nation s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories, their triumphs have not been your triumphs.And while they celebrated in our nation s capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.That all changes right here and right now because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you.It belongs to everyone gathered here today, and everyone watching all across America.This is your day, this is your celebration, and this, the United States of America, is your country.What truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people. Jan. 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.The forgotten men and women of this country will be forgotten no longer.Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonably demands of righteous people and a righteous public.But for too many of our citizens a different reality existsMothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge. And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.We are one nation   and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.For many decades, we ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; we ve defended other nation s borders while refusing to defend our own; and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.We ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.From this day forward, it s going to be only America First.Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.I will fight for you with every breath in my body   and I will never, ever let you down.America will start winning again, winning like never before.We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work   rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world   but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example   we will shine   for everyone to follow.We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones   and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.The Bible tells us,  How good and pleasant it is when God s people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.There should be no fear   we are protected, and we will always be protected.We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action   constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.The time for empty talk is over.Now arrives the hour of action.Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the wind-swept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:You will never be ignored again.Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.Together, we will make America strong again.We will make America wealthy again.We will make America proud again.We will make America safe again.And yes, together we will make America great again. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.","AWESOME! GREG GUTFELD: World hatred of Trump is their problem, not ours! [Video]"
"Jul 20, 2015","The fundamental transformation of America continues . But one photo emerges that defies Barack and Michelle Obama s hateful and divisive narrative.In the latest chapter of the outcry over the Confederate flag issue in South Carolina, an unexpected scene emerged from rallies involving the Ku Klux Klan and black supporters this weekend   a photo of a black police officer helping a white supremacist at the Capitol in Charleston.Members of the Loyal White Knights of the KKK were protesting the state s recent decision to remove the flag from the statehouse grounds. Black advocates held their own rally, and a clash among the two parties ensued.IN THE MIDST OF SO MUCH HATE, ONE HOPEFUL PHOTO EMERGED: It didn t take long for the photograph   taken by Rob Godfrey, the deputy chief of staff for South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley   to spread on the Internet. Not an uncommon example of humanity in SC: Leroy Smith helps white supremacist to shelter & water as heat bears down,  Godfrey wrote in posting the photo on Twitter.Officer Leroy Smith was helping the man find shade and water on a hot day in Charleston, when temperatures reached the upper 90s. About 2,000 people attended the rallies. He was assisting with crowd control on the stairs where the KKK was rallying,  spokeswoman Sherri Iacobelli said of Smith.As might be expected, the general public largely fell into one of two camps   applauding the photo, or questioning it. This kindness chokes me up. How do SC people find that well of caring in the midst of so much hatred?  one person replied in the photo s comment thread. Amazing! I couldn t find it in my heart and I am white,  another remarked. Just curious. Put this in reverse. Would that White Supremacist have done that for Officer Smith at a Black Panther rally?  countered one tweet. Being nice didn t save those 9 people [at the Charleston church shooting] though,  posted another.Thursday, Haley encouraged people to stay away from the KKK rally. The strength and grace the people of South Carolina have shown over the last three weeks have inspired our family, our neighbors and the entire world,  she wrote on her Facebook page.  Our family hopes the people of South Carolina will join us in staying away from the disruptive, hateful spectacle members of the Ku Klux Klan hope to create.

"Jul 21, 2015","Obama s ICE Director Sarah Saldana is not the only one determined to help Obama fundamentally transform America. In 2013, Border Agents pleaded with Congress to not pass the  Gang of Eight  bill. They warned that passing it would make America less safe. ICE Agents warned:The 1,200 page substitute bill before the Senate will provide instant legalization and a path to citizenship to gang members and other dangerous criminal aliens, and handcuff ICE officers from enforcing immigration laws in the future. It provides no means of effectively enforcing visa overstays which account for almost half of the nation s illegal immigration crisis.WE WERE WARNEDU.S. Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, voiced his objections to Sarah Saldana s nomination in 2014 when he submitted the following remarks for the Congressional record on the nomination of Sarah Saldana as Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE): Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the nomination of Sarah Saldana. Ms. Salda a has been nominated to head the nation s top immigration law enforcement agency, which has been at the epicenter of this administration s refusal to enforce our nation s immigration laws.When asked whether she rejects the President s unlawful action to unilaterally grant legal residence and work permits to 5 million individuals illegally in the country, Ms. Salda a, currently the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, responded  no.  Her answer reflects a remarkable disregard for the rule of law that demonstrates that, if confirmed, she will continue the pattern of lawlessness perpetuated by the President and the political leadership of the Department of Homeland Security.Breitbart News- President Obama s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director tells lawmakers that no consequences are planned for sanctuary cities until Congress first passes  comprehensive immigration reform.  Sarah Salda a testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on criminal alien violence.After hearing emotional testimony from families torn apart by illegal immigrant murderers, Republican members of Congress grilled two administration witnesses: Leon Rodriquez, Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and Sarah Salda a, Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Both Rodriquez and Salda a have been tasked with carrying out President Obama s executive amnesty for so-called DREAMers, which includes work permits and medical benefits for low-income illegal aliens funded by citizen taxpayers.Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) repeatedly pressed Salda a on why the Administration was taking no action against sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to turn over dangerous criminal aliens from their prisons and jails to federal law officers. Salda a replied that Congress would first have to pass  comprehensive immigration reform. Vitter:  This has been going on for years and you still are not prepared to say that there is ever going to be any negative consequence to those [sanctuary] jurisdictions. When is that going to change? Salda a:  I presume when you all address comprehensive immigration reform; perhaps it can be addressed there. Vitter described Salda a s answer as  ridiculous  and kept pressing:  And absent Congress passing that [Senate immigration] bill, that you and the Obama Administration prefer, you don t think right now we can stop sanctuary cities from flaunting federal law? You don t think right now there can be any negative consequences when they do not properly cooperate under existing federal law with immigration enforcement? Salda a gave a muddled reply:  That s what I understand that all of you are working on. Ironically, an immigration bill pushed by Senators Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) would have given amnesty to many of the criminal aliens the families who testified today wish to see deported. As Chris Crane, president of the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Council, noted at the time:Senator Rubio left unchanged legislative provisions that he himself admitted to us in private were detrimental, flawed and must be changed. Legislation written behind closed doors by handpicked special interest groups which put their political agendas and financial gains before sound and effective law and the welfare and safety of the American public. As a result, the 1,200 page substitute bill before the Senate will provide instant legalization and a path to citizenship to gang members and other dangerous criminal aliens, and handcuff ICE officers from enforcing immigration laws in the future. It provides no means of effectively enforcing visa overstays which account for almost half of the nation s illegal immigration crisis.Senator Grassley offered an amendment that would that would have barred gang members, such as the notorious MS-13 gang members who have wreaked havoc across the country, from getting amnesty but that amendment was defeated in the Judiciary Committee. The final bill 68 senators voted for therefore expressly made amnesty available to gang members   an amnesty that included access to green cards, welfare and the prize of U.S. citizenship.As The Washington Post reported at the time, this was part of a coordinated effort by members of the Gang of Eight to quash amendments that might have damaged the likelihood of the bill s speedy passage:The eight met in private before each committee hearing, hashing out which amendments they would support and which oppose as a united coalition. Senate aides said amendments were rejected if either side felt they would shatter the deal.Politico confirmed this report:During the Judiciary Committee markup in May, the Gang routinely met to decide which amendments they would support or oppose. In one meeting, the senators thought they had all agreed to defeat a proposal from Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) to require a biometric exit and entry at points of entry before undocumented immigrants could secure green cards, according to one Senate Democratic aide.The day the bill passed the Senate, National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council president Ken Palinkas and president of the National ICE Council Chris Crane, who together represent more than 20,000 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees on the front line of immigration enforcement, issued this joint statement:ICE officers and USCIS adjudications officers have pleaded with lawmakers not to adopt this bill,  they wrote,  The Schumer-Rubio-Corker-Hoeven proposal will make Americans less safe and it will ensure more illegal immigration especially visa overstays in the future. It provides legalization for thousands of dangerous criminals while making it more difficult for our officers to identity public safety and national security threats. The legislation was guided from the beginning by anti-enforcement special interests and, should it become law, will have the desired effect of these groups: blocking immigration enforcement. This is anti-public safety bill and an anti-law enforcement bill.Immigration and the transformation of America is shaping up to be the most passionate issue of the 2016 race.When Governor. Scott Walker (R-WI) was question by a DREAMer during a recent campaign stop and said illegal aliens seeking to become Americans needed to return home. He also suggested at the same stop that foreign worker visas should be limited when American jobs and wages are in danger, a position that polls well with liberals and conservatives alike.Via: Breitbart News",HEAD OF NATION’S TOP IMMIGRATION LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THREATENS Lawlessness In Sanctuary Cities Unless Amnesty Is Passed

"Jul 23, 2016","Supposedly, Hillary Clinton picked Virginia Senator Tim Kaine to help her campaign with national security experience. Isn t it ironic? Here are two candidates that turn out to be bought and paid for by the Islamists! We ve known about Hillary taking millions from the Saudis and others which is truly a conflict of interest as it relates to foreign policy. Not to mention that Hillary s  right-hand woman  Huma Abedin has connections to the Muslim Brotherhood too. Now we re hearing that Tim Kaine has been heavily involved with Islamists!  How can you trust a candidate on national security who appoints a Hamas supporter to their immigration commission and speaks at a dinner honoring a Muslim Brotherhood terror suspect?Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, has a history of embracing Islamists. He appointed a Hamas supporter to a state immigration commission; spoke at a dinner honoring a Muslim Brotherhood terror suspect; and received donations from well-known Islamist groups.Appointing a Muslim Brotherhood Front Leader Who Supports HamasIn 2007, Kaine was the Governor of Virginia and, of all people, chose Muslim American Society (MAS) President Esam Omeish to the state s Immigration Commission. A Muslim organization against Islamism criticized the appointment and reckless lack of vetting.Federal prosecutors said in a 2008 court filing that MAS was  founded as the overt arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in America.  A Chicago Tribune investigation in 2004 confirmed it, as well as MAS  crafty use of deceptive semantics to appear moderate. Convicted terrorist and admitted U.S. Muslim Brotherhood member Abdurrahman Alamoudi testified in 2012,  Everyone knows that MAS is the Muslim Brotherhood. When a state delegate wrote a letter to then-Governor Kaine warning him that the MAS has  questionable origins,  a Kaine spokesperson said the charge was bigotry.Kaine obviously failed to do any kind of basic background checking in Omeish.Speaking at a Dinner Honoring Muslim Brotherhood Terror SuspectIn September 2011, Kaine spoke at a  Candidates Night  dinner organized by the New Dominion PAC that presented a Lifetime Achievement Award for Jamal Barzinji, who the Global Muslim Brotherhood Watch describes as a  founding father of the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood. He first came on to the FBI s radar in 1987-1988 when an informant inside the Brotherhood identified Barzinji and his associated groups as being part of a network of Brotherhood fronts to  institute the Islamic Revolution in the United States.  The source said Barzinji and his colleagues were  organizing political support which involves influencing both public opinion in the United States as well as the United States Government  using  political action front groups with no traceable ties. The indictment of Al-Arian and his colleagues says that they  would and did seek to obtain support from influential individuals, in the United States under the guise of promoting and protecting Arab rights Islamist Financial SupportBarzinji s organization, IIIT, donated $10,000 in 2011 to the New Dominion PAC, the organization that held the event honoring Barzinji that Kaine spoke at. The Barzinji-tied New Dominion PAC donated $43,050 to Kaine s gubernatorial campaign between 2003 and 2005. That figure doesn t even include other political recipients that assisted Kaine s campaign.The PAC has very strong ties to the Democratic Party in Virginia, with the Virginia Public Access Project tallying almost $257,000 in donations. This likely explains why Barzinji s grandson served in Governor McAuliffe s administration and then became the Obama Administration s liaison to the Muslim-American community.The Middle East Forum s Islamist Money in Politics database shows another $4,300 donated to Kaine s Senate campaign in 2011-2012 by officials from Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Another $3,500 came from Hisham Al-Talib, a leader from Barzinji s IIIT organization.It s worth noting that Barzinji s IIIT donated $3,500 to Esam Omeish s 2009 campaign delegate campaign, tying together the cadre of Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders who got into Kaine s orbit.WHO IS HUMA ABEDIN?

Every time the Democrats say they need to call up Jared Kushner or Donald Trump Jr., then call up Chelsea Clinton, call up the Clintons. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md3pmA-IZ_EChaffetz was on fire:  There we have an Inspector General who issues a report stating an actual crime. You have Bill Clinton, the former President, taking millions and millions of dollars from countries that Hillary Clinton was then going into and doing business. So every time a Democrat says,  I gotta talk to Donald Trump Jr., then go up and bring Chelsea Clinton in there. Because she was involved in the Benghazi situation, she was involved with the Foundation. I mean, when I tried as the chairman of the Oversight Committee, to bring in Ben Rhodes to talk about the Iran situation, nobody knows what the deal with Iran was, they claimed executive privilege. Chaffetz says they would never do this to the Clintons and he s right on the money:  They would never, ever, ever do this to the Clintons. And that is what is fundamentally wrong with this. They could have easily, out of all the people in the world they could have easily claimed executive privilege on this one, proximity to the President, it s his son-in-law, he s his closest adviser, he could have easily pulled that off. But there he is, he s gonna go in there as an open book and they should get a lot of credit for it.

They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old one of the guys, the other was 25. They re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background! If you haven t been following this crazy series of events, we ve got a previous report below to fill you in. Basically, Imran Awan and three Muslim relatives were hired to handle IT for the DNC which gave them access to lots of sensitive information NOT GOOD! The Daily Caller just exclusively reported that Awan attempted to destroy hard drives then desperately tried to retrieve them when they were discovered.GETTING THOSE DESTROYED HARD RIVES BACK:Pakistani-born Imran Awan, long-time right-hand IT aide to the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairwoman, has since desperately tried to get the hard drives back, the individual told The Daily Caller News Foundation s Investigative Group.A high-level congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the probe, confirmed that the FBI has joined what Politico previously described as a Capitol Police criminal probe into  serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network  by Imran and three of his relatives, who had access to the emails and files of the more than two dozen House Democrats who employed them on a part-time basis.Capitol Police have also seized computer equipment tied to the Florida lawmaker.Awan s younger brothers, Abid and Jamal, his wife, Hina Alvi, and Rao Abbas, Imran s best friend, are also under investigation. There have been no arrests in the case.THIS CASE IS HUGE! MARIA BARTIROMO IS LIVID ABOUT IT:A Pakistani family under criminal investigation by the U.S. Capitol Police (see our previous report below) for abusing their access to the House of Representatives information technology (IT) system may have engaged in myriad other questionable schemes besides allegedly placing  ghost employees  on the congressional payroll.Imran Awan, his wife Hina, and brothers Abid and Jamal collectively netted more than $4 million in salary as IT administrators for House Democrats between 2009 and 2017. Yet the absence of signs of wealth displayed among them raise questions such as was the money sent overseas or did something other than paychecks motivate their actions?Capitol Police revoked the Awans  access to the congressional IT system in February 2017 after a major data breach was detected. Their access had allowed them to read emails and files of dozens of members, including many serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS   THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS IGNORING THE CRIMINALITY OF THESE BROTHERS:3 MUSLIM BROTHERS Working For Dems In Congress CAUGHT Accessing Unauthorized Top-Secret Government Intel One Has Criminal Background May Have Ties To Muslim Brotherhood [VIDEO]3 Congressional IT employees have been fired for accessing members computer networks without permission. Maria s on the show, knows more about this. Can you fill me in a bit.Here are their names Stuart. let me tell you what the 3 people that were fired on Thursday: Abid, Imran and Jamal Awan. They were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people s computer networks unauthorized. At a minimum they were fired. At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence, foreign affairs and intelligence committees.  Okay? So they were getting very important information, government information. They accessed these computers. That is the least of it. There s also some talk that people are looking into what ties they have into terrorism. Are they impacted by the Muslim Brotherhood? Are they a part of the Muslim Brotherhood? One of them has a criminal background!How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one?

Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Despite the generous salaries, the four were involved in multiple suspicious mortgage transfers and a debt-evading bankruptcy. Abid had more than $1 million in debts following a failed business called Cars International that he ran in Falls Church, Va., from November 2009 to September 2010. Business associates said in court documents that Abid had stolen money and vehicles from them.It s unclear how Abid found time to run an automotive business while working full-time for Congress. He had been on the congressional payroll since 2005. A congressional credit union repossessed two of his personal cars before the business folded.Abid filed for bankruptcy in 2012, but somehow managed to keep ownership of two houses while telling the bankruptcy court and creditors that he had no assets with which to pay them. He signed a sworn statement that he and his wife, Natalia Soba, were living apart and needed separate residences. My spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purpose of evading the requirements of   707(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code,  Abid claimed in bankruptcy documents. But both houses had been in the family for years.Abid s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.A spokesman for Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas told TheDCNF Friday that Jamal s  employment with our office has been terminated. Hilarie Chambers, a spokeswoman for Rep. Sandy Levin   who employed Abid   told TheDCNF that  after being notified by the House Administration Committee, this individual was removed from our payroll. We are confident that everything in our office is secure. Not every Democrat is willing to terminate their connection with these four:Some Democrats have not terminated their connection with the four, including Wasserman Schultz, who employs Imran and who resigned from her DNC post last year after a computer hack revealed embarassing emails.

Politico reported the news of the coming DOJ investigation earlier today:JUSTICE TO PROBE CENTER FOR MEDICAL PROGRESS   While congressional committees investigate Planned Parenthood s practices, the Justice Department agreed to look into whether the group that released the sting videos obtained the footage legally. In response to a request by House Democrats, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday afternoon that Justice would  review all of the information and determine what the appropriate steps moving forward would be.  Planned Parenthood has staunchly defended its practices and claims that the Center for Medical Progress illegally obtained its footage, then excessively edited it to misrepresent what the organization does. The DOJ investigation of the Center for Medical Progress, which, unlike Planned Parenthood, is not in the business of killing healthy, viable unborn babies in order to sell their organs for cash, was announced after several Democratic lawmakers called for the organization to be targeted:Four Democrats in Congress   Reps. Jan Schakowsky, Zoe Lofgren, Jerry Nadler, and Yvette Clarke   have written to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and California Attorney General Kamala Harris, asking them to open investigations into the Center for Medical Progress. The Democrats say the videos were filmed as part of an  elaborate scheme    using  fake identification  and without the approval of the Planned Parenthood doctor who appears in them. It s interesting that Lynch decided so early to make a statement about the group. There are certainly more videos to come, and if Planned Parenthood s panicked press releases are any indication, the footage may be far more damaging than anything that s been revealed thus far. However, given the abject politicization of multiple agencies under Obama s command   including the Internal Revenue Service, which targeted conservative non-profits, and the DOJ, which has been hesitant to investigate Obama allies   it seems unlikely that Lynch and those who report to her will ever crack down on Abortion, Inc.Via: The Federalist",OBAMA IGNORES PLANNED PARENTHOOD BABY PARTS HARVESTER STORY…His DOJ Goes After Whistleblower Group Who Exposed Them

"Jul 28, 2015","Hmmm Ever wonder why the left fears Trump so much? The Daily Beast s Tim Mak and Brandon Zadrozny woke up on Tuesday to find that CNN completely embarrassed them. After publishing a more-than-1,700-word-long invective on Monday evening reprinting old and disproven allegations against GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump by his ex-wife in divorce proceedings Trump s ex-wife herself came out with a statement to CNN standing by her ex-husband, and discrediting the liberal outlet s hit piece which relied heavily on statements she made in divorce proceedings 30 years ago. I have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit. Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president,  Ivana Trump, Donald s ex-wife, said in the statement to CNN.Donald and Ivana Trump had three children together Ivanka, Eric and Donald, Jr., Donald s oldest children and now all officials at Trump s company three of Trump s five children.The embarrassing and quick putdown of the Daily Beast story comes just hours after the outlet ran a blistering headline falsely accusing him of rape:  Ex-Wife: Donald Trump Made Me Feel  Violated  During Sex. The sub-headline of the inaccurate article was even worse, directly leveling the false rape allegation:  Ivana Trump once accused the real-estate tycoon of  rape,  although she later clarified: not in the  criminal sense. The way they justified dredging up the three-decade-old allegation from divorce proceeding transcript, which was again per Ivana s statement to CNN clearly false? Donald Trump introduced his presidential campaign to the world with a slur against Mexican immigrants, accusing them of being  rapists  and bringing crime into the country.  Mak and Zadrozny wrote as the lead of their article before delving into the lurid, old and disproven details.  I mean somebody s doing it!  Who s doing the raping?  Donald Trump said, when asked to defend his characterization. It was an unfortunate turn of phrase for Trump in more ways than one. From there, they delve into the old allegations:  Not only does the current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination have a history of controversial remarks about sexual assault, but as it turns out, his ex-wife Ivana Trump once used  rape  to describe an incident between them in 1989. She later said she felt  violated  by the experience. The incident did come up in the divorce proceedings transcripts and was first reported on widely and publicly by former Texas Monthly and former Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III in his 1993 book:  Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J.

That s gonna leave a mark For the first time this year, Donald Trump tops a state poll of GOP presidential candidates in Florida.A St. Pete Polls survey released on Wednesday shows the New York businessman with 26 percent support, with Jeb Bush in second place with 20 percent.Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is in third place with 12 percent, and Marco Rubio is in fourth place with 10 percent. He s followed by Dr. Ben Carson at 5 percent, Ted Cruz and John Kasich at 4 percent, and Rand Paul at 3 percent. 16 percent are unsure or are supporting another candidate not named in the survey.When it comes to the GOP Senate race, however, there is no clear front-runner at all, some 13 months before the primary election.Among those who actually have an opinion, Pinellas County congressman David Jolly gets 10 percent support, with Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera and Jacksonville area Congressman Ron DeSantis right behind him, essentially tied at 9 percent. Lopez-Cantera gets 9.2 percent support, DeSantis 8.9 percent.Former combat veteran and businessman Todd Wilcox gets 5 percent support (5.2%), tying him with North Florida congressman Jeff Miller (4.9%), who is not officially in the race.But an overwhelming 61 percent say they are undecided.That s a change from a similar poll taken two weeks ago, where Jolly garnered 22 percent support, 10 percent more than Miller.In terms of the reliability of this survey, Matt Florell of St. Pete Polls said his firm has had an impressive run the past three years, with several of its polls coming with the margin of error with final election results. The polling  almost always predicted the eventual winner of the election,  Florell said, citing the recent Jacksonville mayoral election and many of the general election races in 2014. But related to this specific poll,  he added,  I would refer back to our 2014 Democratic Primary poll and how close we were to the final results for both governor and attorney general. The poll of 1,902 Florida likely Republican primary voters was conducted from Saturday, July 18, 2015 to Tuesday, July 28, 2015. It was made up of a sampling of registered Republican party voters from the state of Florida, and has a 2.2% margin of error at a 95% confidence level.Via: St. Peters Blog",SHOCKING POLL: TRUMP PASSES BUSH AND RUBIO IN HOME STATE OF FLORIDA

The woman, 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle ( Kate ), was struck in the chest with a bullet while visiting Pier 14 on the Embarcadero with her family. She was rushed to a nearby hospital but doctors were unable to save her, as she died in her parents  arms a few hours later.The suspect, Francisco Sanchez, was identified as being in his mid-40s and on probation from Texas due to previous, undisclosed crimes. He was arrested after tips from passers-by. Officials said that the killing appeared to be random. Police believe they have recovered the murder weapon from the waters of the San Francisco Bay near the pier, where the suspect allegedly tossed it.On Thursday, two news crews filming live at Pier 14 were mugged at the scene, and one cameraman was pistol-whipped.The San Francisco Chronicle described Steinle s last moments in heartbreaking detail: She fought for her life,  [Liz] Sullivan said, adding that her daughter s heart had stopped two times, and was restarted, in the ambulance. It was a battle, but she just didn t make it,  she said.  It was horrific, but we knew the minute they came to talk to us, it wasn t good. But it was so nice to go in and be with her. Sullivan said that in their final moments together, she softly touched her daughter s face   a face she used to paint when the young woman was a little girl.

"Jul 30, 2016","Meanwhile, the Koch brothers are denying they were attempting to meet with Trump. They re probably too busy schmoozing with open-borders Paul Ryan and other more easily influenced politicians. Hillary will most surely be working overtime to capture those unspent millions that won t be going to Trump Trump tweeted this tonight:I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2016The Kochs are effectively indifferent between Trump and Clinton, though several Trump allies within the network have encouraged the billionaire donors to at least meet with the billionaire candidate. Donors who contribute at least $100,000 to the network are invited to hear from Charles Koch and Republican leaders both about the Kochs  political work along with their philanthropic and policy-focused spending.Some Koch donors, upset by the leadership s unwillingness to back the Republican nominee, have called for the Freedom Partners retreat to feature a poll to decide whether to marshal their resources toward his White House bid. But Holden said unequivocally that a decisive survey of that kind would not happen.May, 2014   Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank notes that,  More than 100 times on the Senate floor in the past few months, the Senate s top Democrat has invoked Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into conservative causes and campaigns. According to Reid, the Koch brothers  are about as un-American as anyone I can imagine  and are attempting to  buy America.  Well, if it is true and what these billionaires are truly engaged in a diabolical plot to undermine the country, then Reid must count himself as one of their prime accomplices.Guess who is putting up lots of money to pressure House Republicans to pass a massive amnesty and immigration increase bill similar to the one Reid championed in the Senate? That would be none other than the Brothers Koch.   Immigration ReformThe Kochs have assembled a political operation some consider to be on par with the Republican National Committee, using a constellation of nonprofit organizations to drive elections and policy fights in recent years. They today have 1,200 paid staff members in 38 states.Yet their refusal to back Trump   whose language on immigration and trade is found to be too incendiary by the libertarian-inspired Kochs   is a leading reason why Trump is expected to be massively outgunned by Clinton and her allies in the advertising wars.The Koch network initially said they would spend $889 million in the lead-up to 2016, with about one-third of that figure dedicated to political activity. Yet Koch officials have scaled back their ambitions, with Holden saying Saturday that the sum was merely a  wish list number. They are now on pace to spend about $750 million, including about $250 million on politics.About $20 million in television has already aired, network officials said, with another $20 million still planned for the fall. The network is currently active in five Senate races, and is currently weighing how to get involved in one more: Marco Rubio s reelection fight in Florida.

Because gangs of Muslim refugees threatening innocent people inside their homes isn t news, but House Democrat losers staying up all night and noshing on take-out in phony gun-control publicity stunt was on the news 24-7.A mob of up to 30 young Somali men paraded through one of Minneapolis  more upscale neighborhoods last week, yelling disparaging comments and threats against homeowners.A female resident of the neighborhood, obviously shaken in a TV interview, related how she was screamed at by a Somali man who threatened to kidnap and rape her. They were screaming at the house that they were going to kidnap you and they were going to rape you,  one Minneapolis resident told KSTP TV.  It was a very traumatizing experience.

"Jul 6, 2017","Actor and immigration activist George Clooney will move to Los Angeles with his wife Amal and newborn twins Ella and Alexander due to security concerns at his England estate, according to a report.Life & Style magazine reported last week that the 56-year-old Oscar-winner will move his newly-expanded family to his mansion in Studio City, California, after deeming his 17th century mansion in Sonning, England to be not sufficiently safe for them. As soon as Amal found out she was pregnant, he hired former Secret Service agents to assess all his properties and make recommendations for improvement,  an unnamed Clooney  insider  told the magazine.  His mansion in Studio City [Calif.] was deemed the most secure, and it s within minutes of an LAPD station. He doesn t feel like Amal and the twins are safe living in the English countryside,  the source told Life & Style.  He s determined to move his family to LA, where he feels much more secure. The report comes as England has been rocked by terrorist attacks in recent months, including the terrorist bombing of a concert by pop singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in June that claimed the lives of 22 people, many of them young children.In May, British government officials disclosed that 23,000 known jihadi terrorists are believed to be residing in Britain, far more than the 3,000 that had initially been reported.The move for the Clooneys comes as both George and Amal have been among the most vocal and active celebrity advocates for open borders and the free flow of refugees between countries.In February of last year, the actor met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and praised the German leader s acceptance of refugees from Syria and other countries. The same month, Clooney told Sky News in an interview that the United States is not doing  enough  to help Syrian refugees, and that 10,000 refugees per year was too low a figure to be admitting into the country.In an April 2016 interview with the BBC, Amal Clooney criticized then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s plans to build a security wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, telling the outlet that the plan does not represent  U.S. values. George has also been an outspoken critic of Trump, telling The Guardian in a March 2016 interview that he believes Trump to be a  xenophobic fascist  and an  opportunist.  He previously described Trump s immigration policy proposals as  idiotic  and  intolerant.   Breitbart In July, 2016, it was reported that the Clooney s were considering moving from their mansion in Italy after a massive makeshift refugee camp was established in Lake Como, the popular and secluded celebrity hideaway where Hollywood A-lister George Clooney keeps a home.The migration of hundreds of people from Arab nations, Africa, and Asia was triggered following the Swiss government s decision to close its southern border with Italy.Now, waiting for smugglers to lead them into northern Europe, groups of migrants are camping out in tattered tents around the Lake Como resort.Flimsy dwellings, clothes and trash are scattered around the Northern Italian town s railway station, where dozens of new families and refugees have flocked.The migrant camp is, oddly enough, just steps away from the front door of immigration activists  George and Amal Clooney s multi-million dollar lakeside mansion in Lake Como, according to the Daily Mail.The power couple has spent some time talking about the migrant crisis. The Clooneys met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February and praised and thanked her for her leadership during the crisis.The Clooneys have taken refuge from the Hollywood spotlight in their summer home in Italy for years. Last year, Page Six reported that Clooney was mulling putting his Lake Como villa on the market due to ever-present and intrusive paparazzi.It is unclear if the recent deluge of refugees pouring into town will have an affect on Clooney s decision to sell or not.

"Jul 8, 2015","WHAT THE HECK! What s happened to the Southern leaders? Confederate flags should be placed on the graves of Civil War soldiers. This is way over the top and a knee-jerk reaction to the shooting in Charleston, SC.The House has voted to ban the display of Confederate flags at historic federal cemeteries in the deep South.The low-profile move came late Tuesday after a brief debate on a measure funding the National Park Service, which maintains 14 national cemeteries, most of which contain graves of Civil War soldiers.The proposal by California Democrat Jared Huffman would block the Park Service from allowing private groups from decorating the graves of southern soldiers with Confederate flags in states that commemorate Confederate Memorial Day. The cemeteries affected are the Andersonville and Vicksburg cemeteries in Georgia and Mississippi.Pressure has mounted to ban display of the flag on state and federal property in the wake of last month s tragic murders at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina.SELLING CONFEDERATE FLAGS BANNED TOO:The House voted to affirm that stores on federal lands operated by the National Park Service cannot sell Confederate flags, in light of a new policy announced in the aftermath of the shooting in Charleston, S.C.Adoption of the amendment to the 2016 Interior Department appropriations bill came easily on a voice vote after just six minutes of debate, where no one spoke in opposition. The amendment reflects a policy announced by the National Park Service in June to ban the sale of Confederate flag merchandise from its gift shops and bookstores.Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), the author of the amendment, said it was important that Congress prevent the sale of the Confederate image on federal property. This House now has an opportunity to add its voice, by ending the promotion of the cruel, racist legacy of the Confederacy,  Huffman said.  While many concessionaires have agreed to do this, I am dismayed by reports that some will continue to sell items with Confederate flag imagery. Read more: The Hill",UNREAL!

While Hillary prowled the empty halls of the White House. (interruption) Some people think I m kidding? You know, they might. You re right, Snerdley. I m not kidding. For those of you Millennials everything I said dead on. Hillary admitted to this. We only know this because Hillary told us, and she told us this proudly. And, by the way, the Drive-By Media back then thought it was wonderful.Nobody said,  What! You re running around talking to Eleanor Roosevelt s ghost?  Nobody said that.

"July 1, 2016","The religious right s attempt to stop women from exercising their legal right to an abortion is facing its biggest setback in years. After realizing that national abortion laws are a no-go, especially with a Democratic president, conservatives have attempted to use their control of state governments in order to roll back women s rights.But the recent 5-3 Supreme Court decision in the case of Whole Woman s Health v. Hellerstedt found that many of the roadblocks erected by the religious right through the Republican Party have put an  undue burden  on women seeking abortion services, and have to be struck down.As a result, there is a wave of anti-choice legislation being undone.Since Monday, laws restricting abortion and non-abortion Planned Parenthood funding have already been temporarily or permanently wiped out in six states. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed a new case Friday challenging a whopping seven of Louisiana s new abortion restrictions. And on the heels of Whole Woman s Health, Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced an effort to pursue repealing laws in eight states through legislatures. (Even lawmakers hostile to abortion may prefer the less expensive option of repealing a law, rather than having to defend one that is unlikely to stand after the Supreme Court s decision.)Now, Republican lawmakers who had planned more abortion restrictions are being forced to put their plans on ice or give up on them completely. They no longer have a blank check for their attacks on women s rights.And the right has a problem nationally. While polls show voters believe in some restrictions on choice, most Americans believe that a woman has a right to abortion services. The support is even higher among women, and Republicans have ceased to be a majority in presidential elections largely thanks to votes from women. It is a losing case for them to be so opposed to abortion rights.In this year s election, Hillary Clinton has already been hammering Donald Trump on choice. Clinton of course supports abortion rights, while since the campaign began Trump has argued in favor of  punishment  for women who get abortions once they are outlawed (as the Republican Party platform calls for).The current Supreme Court vacancy will be key to future battles over abortion, as will vacancies that are likely to open up over the next four years, in large part due to the advanced age of several of the justices, including liberal stalwart Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Featured image via Flickr", Anti-Abortion Laws Collapse In Major Defeat For The Right
"July 1, 2017","On Saturday night, during a speech to honor veterans in Washington, Donald Trump once again perfectly demonstrated what a petulant child he is and how little he cares about the people who sacrificed their lives for this country.Trump was speaking at the  Celebrate Freedom Rally , where he should have been thanking and praising the veterans in attendance. Instead, he completely derailed and went off on one of his characteristically self-centered rants, proving that he is incapable of acting presidential and focusing on anything but himself for more than a few minutes.While some might hope that Trump chose to stop honoring veterans to make an important announcement, most Americans know that wasn t what happened. Instead, Trump stopped his speech to rant about the  fake media  and bragged about how he d won the election (conveniently leaving out the fact that he lost the popular vote by literally millions).No one understands how Trump went from commending veterans to talking about the media and his presidency, but here s his awful rant: We will not let them because the people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House but I m president and they re not. The fact is the press has destroyed themselves because they went too far. Instead of being subtle and smart, they used a hatchet. And the people saw it right from the beginning. The dishonest media will never keep us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf our great American people. It will never happen. Their agenda is not your agenda. Considering that Trump had spent his entire Saturday attacking the press, from CNN to MSNBC, he clearly needed to get this out of his system   and it was in extremely poor taste to do it at this event. Trump s insensitivity, immaturity and self-centeredness continues to embarrass the country, and every American who supported Trump should be ashamed.

"July 10, 2017","Things just keep getting worse for Donald Trump Jr. With the word  treason  floating around on both the Left and Right, the last thing he needs is more inconvenient facts coming out about his meeting with a Russian lawyer past what we already know. Fortunately for him, he had the foresight to hire a criminal defense lawyer before the other shoe dropped.Speaking of shoes dropping, new information has come out about that meeting. Not only did he go there with the intent of getting information about Hillary Clinton from the Russians, Trump Jr. was informed beforehand that the material was part of the Russian government s effort to help install his dad in the Oval Office.The New York Times reports:The email to the younger Mr. Trump was sent by Rob Goldstone, a publicist and former British tabloid reporter who helped broker the June 2016 meeting. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he was interested in receiving damaging information about Mrs. Clinton, but gave no indication that he thought the lawyer might have been a Kremlin proxy.Mr. Goldstone s message, as described to The New York Times by the three people, indicates that the Russian government was the source of the potentially damaging information. It does not elaborate on the wider effort by Moscow to help the Trump campaign. There is no evidence to suggest that the promised damaging information was related to Russian government computer hacking that led to the release of thousands of Democratic National Committee emails.According to Trump Jr., the meeting did not amount to much. For his light treason, he says, he received no information and they just chatted about an adoption program (yes, that s what he s going with).The adoption program in question was halted by Vladimir Putin in response to the Magnitsky Act, a U.S. law that blacklists Russian human rights abusers. Putin became so incensed that he decided American families may not adopt Russian children. The New York Times notes that Trump Jr. ended the meeting when the adoption program was brought up.The meeting was also attended by former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and Ivanka Trump s husband, Jared Kushner   a lot of people for an innocent meeting about a Russian adoption program, but just the right amount for a little bit of treason.No inconsistency in statements, meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions.

"July 11, 2016","Presidential elections are won by well-prepared, well organized multimillion dollar efforts that are executed at the state level. Some of the best models of this have been President Bush s campaign in 2004 and President Obama s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. What needs to be done and how it should be done are known by seasoned campaign operatives and candidates who put the people in place to make it happen.Donald Trump s presidential campaign, and the Republican Party s planning to help his campaign in multiple states that are key to winning, are a complete disaster with only four months to go until the election, according to a new report from the Associated Press.With early voting beginning in less than three months in some states, the review reveals that the national GOP has delivered only a fraction of the ground forces detailed in discussions with state leaders earlier in the year. And that is leaving anxious local officials waiting for reinforcements to keep pace with Democrat Hillary Clinton in the states that matter most in 2016.The Republican Party s massive failure gets even worse when you zoom in to swing states, as the Associated Press has:Some examples of Republican shortfalls: Ohio Republicans thought they were going to see 220 paid staffers by May; in reality there are about 50. Plans for Pennsylvania called for 190 paid staffers; there are about 60. Iowa s planned ground force of 66 by May actually numbers between 25 and 30. In Colorado, recent staff departures have left about two dozen employees, far short of the 80 that were to have been in place.AP even found that Trump s headquarters in Florida, one of the most important states in the fight for the electoral college, was closed and its voice mailbox full. Florida has 29 electoral votes and in 2012 was decided by a margin of 0.87 percent   on the ground organizing is key to winning it.These failures at the state organizing level don t even take into account the massive disparity in campaign advertising between Clinton and Trump. While she has been pumping out ads in important states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado, and New Mexico along with super PACs that support her, Trump hasn t been advertising at all. In 2012, Mitt Romney s campaign was outspent by President Obama, but he was actually spending money   Trump isn t spending on much, besides many of his own entities who showed up as campaign vendors.Republicans, especially in 2012, derided President Obama s background as a community organizer, but they could do with one right now to organize for their candidate in the communities he needs in order to have a chance at winning.

"July 12, 2016","President Obama gave a powerful speech today at the memorial service for the five police officers who lost their lives in the horrific ambush on law enforcement that took place last Thursday in Dallas, Texas. Unfortunately, but not at all unexpectedly, most of his moving words were lost on conservatives.The president dropped some major truth bombs on race in America and followed up with a discussion of the choices that we  as a society  make which bring us to the place we find ourselves today.As a society, we choose to underinvest in decent schools.  We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book   (applause)   and then we tell the police  you re a social worker, you re the parent, you re the teacher, you re the drug counselor.  We tell them to keep those neighborhoods in check at all costs, and do so without causing any political blowback or inconvenience.  Don t make a mistake that might disturb our own peace of mind.  And then we feign surprise when, periodically, the tensions boil over.Right-wingers began to lose their minds the moment it became clear that Obama was going to have anything more to say than simply offering the worthless thoughts and prayers conservatives are so fond of.

"July 12, 2017","Now that we ve known Donald Trump well for a while now, we should all know that the man who occupies the Oval Office (for now) likes to make sh*t up. His mind even manufactures people, like his former spokesman John Barron, who was actually Trump. Since the campaign trail, though, Trump has been talking about his friend  Jim,  and much like John Barron, Jim doesn t appear to exist.A few weeks ago, the New York Times published an incredibly long and comprehensive list of all the lies Donald Trump has told, just since taking office. That was a few weeks ago, though   before the G20 and before he claimed his son had a meeting with Russians about his campaign and that Trump Sr. knew nothing about it.Between Trump s regular pattern of lying and the fact that he already has a pattern of making people up, it shouldn t be a surprise that the media hasn t been able to find his friend Jim. Oh, and by the way, Jim is kind of a xenophobic asshole.The way Trump tells it   Jim is a friend who loves Paris and used to visit every year. Yet when Trump travels to the city Thursday for his first time as president, it s unlikely that Jim will tag along. Jim doesn t go to Paris anymore. Trump says that s because the city has been infiltrated by foreign extremists.Whether Jim exists is unclear. Trump has never given his last name. The White House has not responded to a request for comment about who Jim is or whether he will be on the trip.Source: Washington PostThis isn t the first time Jim has complained about all the brown people in Paris. In February, Trump told an audience that Jim loved Paris, but alas, he doesn t go there anymore because  Paris is no longer Paris. While anecdotes, often exaggerated, have long been a tool for political orators, we can t think of anyone who has made up an imaginary friend. That s just weird.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images", Apparently Donald Trump Has An Imaginary Xenophobic Friend Named Jim
"July 13, 2016","When Bill O Reilly calls himself a journalist, he shows he has no idea what that word actually means because he seems to be wholly unable to fact-check anything. On The O Reilly Factor Wednesday night, he went after Democrats and the economy the same way Republicans love to, by attacking the idea of helping low-wage workers as something that will destroy absolutely everyone.Basically, he believes that if we want people to live comfortably on only 40 hours of work per week, we ll have to raise wages so high that we ll cause the U.S. economy to collapse. In fact, he seems to think that reducing poverty by raising the minimum wage is a radical left-wing, fringe idea that will ruin our economy if we actually go ahead and implement it.In short, he says it s a horrible idea because he has no idea how our economy works.The funny thing is that he used to trumpet a higher minimum wage   at least, he used to support a $10/hr minimum wage. However, he s also claimed that raising the minimum wage will only help a tiny fraction of the population, because reasons. Why hurt everyone to only help a very few people who don t deserve it anyway, right?He s also accused the government of at least being a major contributor to the problem, if not the whole source of the problem.  Big government doesn t work,  he says, while literally millions of Americans are the victims of corporate greed. No, earning power has not improved much under President Obama, but there are two problems that Billo the Clown is overlooking: First is an obstructionist Congress, and second is just how limited the president s power actually is when it comes to the economy. If Congress won t do what he wants, even on economic measures, then he s stuck except for where federal contractors are concerned.There s a reason Bill O Reilly has earned the nickname  Billo the Clown,  and it s because of utter bull cookies like this. He fancies himself a journalist.

"July 13, 2017","Chicago Police Sergeant George Granias  abuse of a black woman he arrested and falsely accused of driving drunk has a very disturbing internet habit. During an investigation into his December 2013 arrest and subsequent beating of Patassa Johnson, URL s with names like  n**gadown.com  and  n***gaguns.com  were discovered owned by Granias. There were also violent URL s like  murdertech.com.  The websites were discovered with a simple internet search of Granias by Johnson s lawyer, Brenden Shiller.According to the Daily Beast, Johnson is expected to get $185,000 from the City of Chicago. The driving under the influence charge was dropped. The lawsuit says that Johnson suffered an unbelievably harrowing experience at the hands of this racist cop:The officer cuffed her in the back of a squad car and drove her to a police station, where  Granias grabbed [Johnson] from the back of the car,  and roughly escorted her into the station, according to a lawsuit Johnson filed against the city in 2015.  Inside the station, Defendant Granias beat [Johnson] while [Johnson] was in hand-cuffs. Brenden Shiller says of discovering the racist websites that were registered to Grainias   some as recently as 2013: We came across that URL and said what the hell is this? He made it live and accessible to the public. You can create a website, but Google wouldn t know about it unless you make it live and accessible. In addition to the racist websites, Granias has three other disciplinary remarks on his police record, all of them related to abuses of power. Nevertheless, he remains in this position of great power at the Chicago Police Department as we speak. Further, I d be willing to bet that for every mark on that record, there are ten incidents that he covered up.This is clearly a man who has issues with violence and is most definitely a racist. The Chicago Police Department should have fired him immediately and made it clear to any other departments that Granias might apply to that he is unfit for duty.This is the kind of negligence that gets people killed. Hopefully, this guy is brought up on charges for what he did to this poor woman, but I won t hold my breath on that one.Watch a local news report on this case below:Featured image via video screen capture", Racist Chicago Cop Who Beat A Handcuffed Black Woman Found With Trove Of Slur-Filled Websites
"July 14, 2016","Fox News Channel host Bill O Reilly and Republican presidential nominee believe that the horrific attack in Nice, France means it s time to push a  world war. Dozens were killed when a tractor trailer truck plowed into a crowd watching Bastille Day fireworks. The attacker then stepped out his car and was shot and killed by authorities. President Obama said,  I condemn in the strongest terms what appears to be a horrific terrorist attack in Nice, France, which killed and wounded dozens of innocent civilians. Appearing on The O Reilly Factor while details about the attack were still coming in, host Bill O Reilly said to Trump that if the attack is proven to be a terrorist event  I believe it s a world war now, we re in a world war scenario. It s no longer just isolated ISIS attacks. Do you agree with that? Trump told him,  I certainly do,  adding,  it s out of control. Trump then went on to attack President Obama saying,  we have a president that doesn t want to call it what it is.  Trump then called for  strong  and  smart leadership  or else the problem is  going to get worse. In contrast to Trump and O Reilly and their  world war  rhetoric, Hillary Clinton appeared on CNN with Anderson Cooper and stressed that  this is a horrific attack  and that instead of the O Reilly/Trump push for a wide war,  we are at war with these terrorist groups and what they represent. Trump has regularly argued that Muslims are somehow responsible for all terrorism. Trump has argued, without evidence, that Muslim communities are slow to report terroristic activities to the authorities. In reality, Muslims have often done so   including in the case of the Orlando night club shooter.Trump has also argued that he would bar Muslims from entering the United States if he were elected president, and has also said he would consider a registry of Muslims that many said sounded similar to Nazi registries of Jewish people.Featured image via YouTube"," Trump, Fox News Push ‘World War’ After Attack In Nice, France (VIDEO)"

Over the past week or so, Trump and his corrupt inner circle have been in the news nonstop for their unethical behavior revolving around Russia.If America is sick of reading about it, reporters must be sick of talking about it   and this was evident when Chuck Todd went off on Trump on Friday during MTP Daily. Todd did not hold back as unleashed an attack for several minutes, brutally mocking the Trump administration for the never-ending avalanche of bad news surrounding Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with a Russian lawyer. Blasting the White House for trying to hide parts of the story, Todd said: Their responses this week have proven to be incomplete at best and untrue at worst. Todd was referring to a breaking report by NBC news, in which an additional unknown person   former Soviet counterintelligence officer Ranit Akhmetshin, was found to also have been in attendance during the now infamous meeting with the Russian lawyer. To make his point even more powerful, Todd ran several clips from the past few days that blatantly showed White House officials lying and denying that they were hiding any information. It was a brilliant segment, and Todd perfectly showed America why Trump and his minions cannot be trusted. In conclusion, Todd said: Folks, this week has been a giant PR, political, and possibly legal disaster for this administration.

Now that we know Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is Donald Trump s pick, we re now left to sift through clues to figure out who Hillary Clinton will give the nod too.Well, one huge clue was given when Elizabeth Warren showed up at Hillary Clinton s Washington D.C. home today, but an ever bigger clue has come as Warren s name appears to no longer be on the speaking schedule for the Democratic National Convention.Originally slotted to speak as the keynote speaker on Monday night of the convention, Warren s name is now missing.According to Politico, this is the schedule as it stands now:Monday:  First Lady Michelle Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders and DREAMer Astrid Silva Gavel time expected at 3:00 p.m.Tuesday:  President Bill Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:00 p.m.Also scheduled Tuesday are Mothers of the Movement members Gwen Carr, Mother of Eric Garner; Sybrina Fulton, Mother of Trayvon Martin; Maria Hamilton, Mother of Dontr  Hamilton; Lucia McBath, Mother of Jordan Davis; Lezley McSpadden, Mother of Michael Brown; Cleopatra Pendleton-Cowley, Mother of Hadiya Pendleton; Geneva Reed-Veal, Mother of Sandra Bland.Wednesday:  President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Thursday:  Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Very interesting indeed.Noticeably also missing are other members on Clinton s shortlist for vice president, such as Sherrod Brown and Tim Kaine, but seeing as Warren was scheduled to speak, and now isn t, it could be very, very telling.Now that Trump has rounded out his ticket with Mike Pence, a man who represents the only group Trump has yet to openly hate   the LGBT community   it s looking pretty good for Clinton come November, and hopefully whoever she picks as her VP will round out the ticket nicely.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images", One Person On Hillary’s Shortlist For VP Was Just Removed From DNC Speaker Schedule

I guess Trump was taken by surprise that a 64-year-old woman could possibly be fit and attractive, so he did what no one with any diplomatic skills would ever even consider   he complimented her looks, but not just her general looks, he told her she has a  good  body. Perhaps the most disturbing part of that is that he thought he was being appropriate.Here s the video:Twitter had a field day with it: And what I hope #BrigitteMacron said to @POTUS  And you look like a sack of s*** you lumpen plonker .

"July 16, 2016","Now that Indiana governor Mike Pence has officially been announced as Donald Trump s running mate, it s important to understand exactly who he is and what his stances on key issues are. Those who were expecting Trump to select a more moderate VP pick are going to learn really fast that Pence is anything but moderate.During a segment on MSNBC s AM Joy, an expert on Christian fundamentalism made it very clear that Pence is a dangerous right-wing radical, especially concerning his views on women s healthcare rights.The show s host, Joy Reid asked Sharlet what his thoughts on Pence are concerning the  nexus between evangelicalism and Republicanism in Washington. Sharlet answers, calling Pence a  broker  between the two. To understand Mike Pence and to understand that kind of religious conservative politics, you have to not think of social conservatism and fiscal conservatism as separate, but like Mike Pence say,  Our goal, our mission, is to marry fiscal and moral values.  He sees them as one in the same, so when you go back in his record and you look at his speeches about abortion, which are really something, Sharlet answered.  He is probably the most anti-abortion presidential or VP candidate we ve had. You see him also bringing in financial. He sees it if we don t stop abortion, our economy will collapse. So he s the guy who sort of stands in the middle between those two factions of the Republican Party. At that point, Reid brings up Pence s record regarding abortion, Planned Parenthood, and his failures as a leader during a recent HIV outbreak, saying: On abortion, he signed a law as Indiana governor banning abortions because of genetic anomalies, abortions that were unfortunate anomalies, and he also signed a law mandating, and this is weird, women who have a miscarriage or an abortion had to have a burial for the fetus and must cremate after a miscarriage or abortion. On LGBT rights, he signed a law allowing religious beliefs as a defense against discrimination in lawsuits, and then after a backlash, he s revised the law to exclude LGBT discrimination which got him in trouble with conservatives in Indiana. On prison, he reinstated a ten-year mandatory minimum drug sentencing,  said Reid.That s only a small sampling of what Sharlet and Reid had to say about Pence s record. It s very clear that the GOP has no interest in supporting even a faux-moderate candidate this election judging by the support he is receiving.The bottom line is that Pence is too dangerous to allow into office.

Now a source is saying he didn t read the part about the Russians, despite the fact that the subject line read:  Re: Russia   Clinton   private and confidential. In the emails, the contact, a former tabloid reporter called Rob Goldstone, said the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was a  Russian government attorney  who could provide  very high level and sensitive information  as  part of Russia and its government s support for Mr Trump. But a source close to the situation told BuzzFeed that Mr Kushner did not read to the bottom of the email, missing out key words like  Russian government  and therefore did not realise what the meeting was about.Source: IndependentOh, and the defense gets worse. According to the source, Kushner only attended the meeting to talk about Russian adoptions. There was no mention of Russian adoptions at all in the email chain.Not coincidentally, Donald Trump s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, also claimed that he was innocent because he didn t read the whole thing.What makes it even more difficult to believe Kushner is that he s already proven himself a consummate liar.

Senator John McCain (R-AZ)  is out for emergency surgery   we wish him well, of course    and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) were already hard  NO!  votes. Then, late Monday night, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jerry Moran (R-KS) came out against the bill as well. Each Senator had his or her own reasons for opposing McConnell, but those reasons matter not for now. The votes to pass this disastrous piece of legislation simply are not there.Of course, upon hearing that he was, once again about to be humiliated on one of his signature campaign promises, Donald Trump took to Twitter to fume about the bill s failure in the Senate. He tweeted that he wants to simply repeal the Affordable Care Act now and rip healthcare away from millions. He also said the unthinkable in this hyper-partisan environment: Work with Democrats.

Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization? King went on to praise  western civilization itself  as solely the product of whites, citing western Europe and the United States as the product of white ingeniuity.The congressman failed to note the myriad of contributions made by blacks, Latinos, Asians, and other races, or that many of the white contributions he cited were made at the expense of slave labor using blacks, especially in the United States.King, who has been ranked one of the least effective members of Congress, has a history of controversial and off-the-wall comments. King defended candidate Todd Akin after he said a woman with a  legitimate rape  would have her body  shut down  to prevent pregnancy.When he opposed immigration reform, King notoriously said: For every one who s a valedictorian, there s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert. Opposing President Obama in 2008, King said: I will tell you that, if he is elected president, then the radical Islamists, the al-Qaida, the radical Islamists and their supporters, will be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11. Slamming affirmative action, King said,: There s been legislation that s been brought through this House that sets aside benefits for women and minorities.

Well, under Obama, the nation s unemployment rate has gone from 10 percent to under 5 percent.No one is claiming the economy is perfect.

"July 2, 2017","Chris Christie s New Jersey is in such gridlock that they ve had shut down the government, which means they ve had to shut down the beaches   the very same beaches New Jerseyans love to spend their summers. One New Jersey family, though, is spending the weekend at the shore. Governor Chris Christie and his family have one beach all to themselves and when his constituents complained, he gave them the most Trump answer possible, which boils down to  I m governor and you re not. That s just the way it goes. That was Gov. Chris Chrstie s response to reporters on Saturday when asked why it was okay for his family to vacation at Island Beach State Park over the Fourth of July weekend   while everyone else was locked out of the popular destination because of the government shutdown Christie ordered, leaving state parks, beaches and other facilities closed. The governor has a residence at Island Beach. Others don t,  Christie said.  Run for governor and you can have the residence. Source: Philly.comThe residence is owned by the state of New Jersey.

He s on the way out because of term limits.If Christie s verbal bird to his constituents sounds familiar, it could be because it s eerily reminiscent of Donald Trump, who has more than one occasion said something to the effect of  I m President and you re not.  The first was in a Time Magazine interview, where he defended his way of governing: I m a very instinctual person, but my instinct turns out to be right. Hey, look, in the meantime, I guess I can t be doing so badly, because I m President, and you re not,  he told Time s Washington bureau chief, Michael Scherer.Source: CNNOn Sunday, Trump uttered a similar sentiment in a complaint about the media: The fake media is trying to silence us,  Mr. Trump told the crowd at the concert hall, after returning to Washington briefly from his weekend getaway at his golf club in New Jersey.  But we will not let them. Because the people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House. But I m president and they re not. Source: NY TimesIt s not surprising, considering that Christie made his name with a flagrant disregard for civility, that he d channel Trump   or perhaps it is the other way around.

"July 20, 2017","Presidents are supposed to serve the American people, but Trump has made it clear that everyone works for him and he is not to be questioned or investigated or placed under scrutiny. Ever. Even when it comes to Russia, even when it comes to his severe lack of ethics and his Constitutional violations. We know about many of his conflicts of interest, which very well may break the law, and one would expect them to improve as time goes by. However, they re getting worse, not better.Historically, presidents do not go into office with the number of business interests Trump has. Previous presidents have placed what interests they do have into blind trusts, which means the president separates himself from them entirely. He has no influence, he gets no information. Trump? Not so much. Sure, his businesses are in a trust, but his sons manage it and they give him updates regularly.Even if they didn t, they re helping their father corrupt the Office of the President with his business. Trump s sons have pitched an idea for budget hotels called  American Idea,  and have gone so far as to sign letters of intent to build said hotels in economically depressed areas in red states.That isn t an  America first,  initiative so much as it s a way for Trump to expand his brand and boost his popularity among the plebes he otherwise ignores.(We all have a million dollars that says those hotels will hire foreign workers for cheap, as Mar a Lago in Florida just did.)Trump s presence at his golf clubs serves as promotion, and some of them (like Mar a Lago) are raking in the dough from increased membership fees and people willing to pay them in order to say they ve rubbed shoulders with him and other world leaders. His decision to roll back an environmental policy ensuring clean drinking water directly benefits his golf courses, which means he brings in even more money.The Trump International Hotel in D.C., situated in the historic Old Post Office building, isn t supposed to belong to any government officials. The reason Trump can have such an interest in it is supposedly because his business is in a trust, so he technically doesn t have an interest. Or something. Regardless, the hotel is supposed to be donating profits from foreign officials who stay there to the U.S. Treasury, but Trump said that asking foreign officials to identify themselves as such would  diminish the guest experience. So he s directly profiting from foreign officials who stay there, either to curry favor with him or because they think it d be rude to stay with a competitor. It s probably both.Trump was obviously corrupt before before he was even elected   he s known this whole time how to milk campaigns and how to milk his office for all its worth, so that when he leaves he s richer than ever. During his campaign, he made heavy use of his own properties. That might make sense, but the law reveals just how he lined his pockets with campaign donations.Federal election law requires a campaign to pay fair market value for goods and services bought from a candidate s own businesses. Most candidates with their own business interests wind up spending one to three percent of their total spending on their businesses. Trump s spending was above 10 percent. There s no way that was an accident.Trump is corrupt. He knows it. We all know it. That s why he says that the president isn t subject to ethics laws   he s trying to build the case that he can do what he wants because he s the president and we re not.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images", Corruption: Here’s How Donald Trump Is Breaking The Law And Profiting From The Presidency
"July 21, 2016","North Carolina s anti-transgender law, HB2, has made the state and its notoriously bigoted governor, Pat McCrory, come under fire from decent people and companies everywhere. Well, now they are going to take a huge hit to the state s economy as the National Basketball Association has pulled its All-Star game out of Charlotte over the law. The sports organization said that it would be unable to host the convention while the law is on the books and being enforced. They said in a statement: Our week-long schedule of All-Star events and activities is intended to be a global celebration of basketball, our league, and the values for which we stand, and to bring together all members of the NBA community   current and former players, league and team officials, business partners, and fans.While we recognize that the NBA cannot choose the law in every city, state, and country in which we do business, we do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by HB2. As expected, Pat McCrory, like the good, small-minded bigot that he is, struck back and blamed liberals for the consequences of his own bigotry: The sports and entertainment elite, Attorney General Roy Cooper and the liberal media have for months misrepresented our laws and maligned the people of North Carolina simply because most people believe boys and girls should be able to use school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers without the opposite sex present. Twenty-one other states have joined North Carolina to challenge the federal overreach by the Obama administration mandating their bathroom policies in all businesses and schools instead of allowing accommodations for unique circumstances. Left-wing special interest groups have no moral authority to try and intimidate the large majority of American parents who agree in common-sense bathroom and shower privacy for our children. The Human Rights Campaign immediately came out to praise the NBA for their strong stand against bigotry. President Chad Griffin said: Today the NBA and Commissioner Silver sent a clear message that they won t stand for discrimination against LGBTQ employees, players or fans, said Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin in a statement.  The NBA repeatedly warned state lawmakers that their hateful HB2 law created an inhospitable environment for their 2017 All-Star Game and other events. Nevertheless, Governor McCrory, Senator Berger and Speaker Moore doubled down on HB2 and refused to undo their discriminatory and costly error in judgment. Every day that HB2 remains on the books, people across North Carolina are at risk of real harm. We appreciate the leadership of the NBA in standing up for equality and call once again on lawmakers to repeal this vile HB2 law. HB2 is nothing more than a strike at the LGBTQ community. These right-wing transphobes and homophobes are so afraid of LGBTQ people that they are literally policing who can pee. It s a level of bigotry and insanity that is unacceptable in our society, and businesses are sending clear messages that they don t reward open, overt, and deliberate discrimination. The NBA follows a long list of businesses and entertainers who have refused to enter North Carolina until they stop making discrimination a matter of law.Keep the pressure on, big business. In the end, hate never wins.Featured image via Wikipedia ", NBA Yanks All-Star Game Out Of Charlotte Over Bigoted Bathroom Law

Veselniskaya says: Let s put it this way   I m ready to clarify the situation in today s mass hysteria, only within the legal field or through lawyers, or by testifying in the Senate. When asked by a reporter if she was willing to go before the Senate, Veselnitskaya said: Yes, if I am guaranteed safety.

Well, something hot is brewing if this woman is worrying that something might happen to her if she breaks her silence.

"July 22, 2016","A black Cincinnati police officer is currently receiving backlash over a controversial Facebook post where he warned his African-American friends and family about white officers that may be targeting them because of their race.Officer Freddie Vincent had shared the message earlier this month, which instructed black people on what to do if they happen to get stopped by police. The post read: A message to all my Afro America friends and family. When you are encountered by a white officer make sure that you are in a public place, and comply to all of their commands, because they are looking for a reason to kill a black man. And always keep your hands in the air, and never resist. I m so tired of cops using these famous words  I was in fear of my life.  I m praying for Louisiana, that could have been my nephew in B.R. FacebookThis post was written after the high profile police brutality incidents in Louisiana and Minnesota, so it is perfectly understandable why those tragedies would be weighing on Vincent s heart and he would want to warn his loved ones of the dangers they might encounter. Vincent also had other posts on his Facebook account that addressed police brutality. One of them, posted on July 12, was an illustration on 10 rules of survival if stopped by the police.  Vincent commented over the illustration: I can t promise you that this is 100% true, but it s about 85% to 95% and you just might make it home safely. Unfortunately, Vincent s post has landed him in hot water. According to Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac, Vincent s post is being reviewed to see if it falls within the department s  social media procedure and our rules and regulations.  In a statement, Isaac said: The Cincinnati Police Department strives to maintain a culture of professionalism, as well as transparency and accountability for our actions. I am proud of the work of the men and women of the Cincinnati Police Department and our efforts to work collaboratively with the community. We are aware of a recent post to a commonly used social media site by one of our officers that refers to an interpretation of a law enforcement officer s actions. The comments that were posted are under review as they relate to our Social Media procedure and our Rules and Regulations. A panel discussion was later held at New Prospect Baptist Church in Roselawn, where an audience asked Isaac if there was racism in the Cincinnati Police Department. Isaac responded: I don t think anyone can say there is not racism inside the department. Vincent s post may be even more prominent now, as we are seeing situations where black men are doing everything that police tell them to, and still being shot. Just earlier this week, unarmed black man Charles Kinsey was shot with his hands in the air while trying to take care of a patient with autism. Fortunately, Kinsey lived but many are not so lucky. Referencing Kinsey s incident, Bishop Bobby Hilton of Word of Deliverance Ministries and president of the local chapter of civil rights group National Action Network commented on this horrific incident: When there is a hint of this, that we have police officers who have this thought process about black men, these officers have to be dismissed. We are now seeing situations in Minnesota and Florida, where black men are doing what they are told by police   putting their hands up, complying with all instructions   and they are still shot. It s understandable why Vincent s posts have caused a stir, but to pretend that there wasn t some truth to what he was saying is ignorant. African Americans have been targeted and mistreated by police for far too long, and it is a situation that must be addressed.Featured image via Flickr", Police Officer Warns About White Cops ‘Looking For A Reason To Kill A Black Man’ (IMAGE)
"July 22, 2017","A Republican state senator from Arizona, Kelli Ward, has unleashed a veiled, but nonetheless vicious, attack against Senator John McCain in the wake of his brain tumor diagnosis, and her whole entire attitude positively reeks of someone trying to bury McCain before he s gone. In discussing who Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey could appoint to replace McCain, should he step down, she actually gave this as her reason for she should be the person to take his place: Because I have a proven track record of years in the state Senate of being extremely effective and of listening to the voice of the people that I represent. And you know, I made an extremely good showing against Senator McCain against all odds. Ward tried to primary McCain in 2016 and lost. She launched a campaign against Senator Jeff Flake for 2018 almost as soon as she lost to McCain. Furthermore, while she was running against McCain in last year s primaries, she said he was old and weak and could die while in office.All of this smacks of someone thinking,  Oh look! McCain s going to die! I have another chance to take his seat! It s disgusting, really.If she were appointed to take McCain s place, she ll have some early enemies in the Senate because of her behavior. Sen.

"July 23, 2016","Speaking at the National Council of La Raza conference in Orlando on Saturday, Elizabeth Warren went after Donald Trump and completely desecrated him in a fiery speech.Addressing the crowd at the national conference of the largest Hispanic advocacy organization, the Massachusetts senator stressed the importance of economic issues as they pertain to the Hispanic community and denounced Trump s racist rhetoric. We believe that diversity has made this country strong,  Warren said. And racism, sexism, homophobia, hatred, injustice, and bigotry have no place here. We will never build Donald Trump s stupid wall,  she said to a standing ovation.Warren said that come hell or high water, Clinton  must  win this election in November. Hillary Clinton must be the next President of the United States, and Tim Kaine must be the next Vice President of the United States,  Warren said.  Not  can , not  should , we must make them. Hillary Clinton must be the next President of the United States, and Tim Kaine must be the next Vice President of the United States,  Warren said.  Not  can , not  should , we must make them. Warren, who joked that I haven t been this excited to come to Orlando since Harry Potter arrived,  also stressed the importance of healthcare during her 20-minute speech, noting that one in four Latinos have no health care. I know how hard every single one of you is working, sometimes we ve got to stop and we ve got to remind ourselves what it is that we re working for,  Warren said.  Why we get up in the mornings and why we fight.  It is time to come down hard on predatory practices that allow financial institutions to systematically strip wealth out of Latino communities, and we are ready to fight for it. She also demanded reforms in drug laws and criminal sentencing as well as immediate action on climate change, in addition to her focus on economic issues. We believe that no one should work full-time and still live in poverty,  Warren said.  Latino workers earn less than white workers and African-American workers. That means raise the minimum wage, enforce overtime pay, pass sick leave and family leave and schedules that work. Warren then called out the Republican nominee by name. I have a few things to say that will not fit into 140 characters on Twitter,  she said, calling Trump  a weak, thin-skinned man ,  small, insecure, money-grubbing  and  A man who will never be president of the United States. She spoke of the heart wrenching story of a Hispanic man who testified during a Senate hearing on the 2008 mortgage crisis who told how he had  struggled not to cry  when he told his daughters that they were going to lose their home. She then contrasted his story with that of the bigoted billionaire who said he was excited for the real estate market to crash.   He was drooling over the idea of a housing meltdown because it meant he could buy up more properties on the cheap. What kind of a man does that?  she asked.The senator concluded that this election  will decide what kind of a people we are and what kind of a country we want to build.

"July 24, 2016","Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz is stepping down as chair of the DNC, effective the second she gavels the Philadelphia convention closed.  This move comes on the heels of DNC insider emails that were leaked that appear to show that the DNC was in the tank for for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to win the Democratic nomination over unlikely rival Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. The leaked documents were simply the straw that broke the camel s back, though. Wasserman Schulz has been a divisive figure within the party leadership for sometime now, and after this Democratic leaders decided that she had to go. Wasserman Schultz says of the decision: Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals [which include electing Clinton president] is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention. As Party Chair, this week I will open and close the Convention and I will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats, but for all Americans. Wasserman Schultz will now speak on Monday afternoon, though originally she had been removed from all speaking slots at the Democrats  big event. However, it seems that her supporters, and even the outgoing DNC chair herself fought for her right to be able to speak. Senator Sanders had this to say on the subject:What does this mean for the Democratic Party? It means more party unity, that s what. We cannot win in November   or any other election   if the party splits. In the beginning, everyone underestimated the power of Sen. Sanders  message, and it seems that rank and file, establishment Democrats and party leaders saw him and his supporters as a distraction and an annoyance rather than someone whose ideas and policy proposals should be taken seriously. This was a mistake. We can never assume that everyone is as loyal to any political party as said party s leadership would like them to be.Now, as a firm Clinton supporter, I have had my issues with Bernie Sanders and his supporters. However, party unity and beating Donald Trump is the top priority, not petty infighting. Sanders had great influence over this year s party platform- the most progressive in the party s history   and he and his supporters should be proud of what they have accomplished.Now that DWS is out of our way, let s go forth and kick butt and elect Democrats from the top of the ballot down in November.Feataured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images", Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s DNC Resignation Clears The Way For A Better Democratic Party
"July 24, 2017","On Monday night, Donald Trump traveled to West Virginia to give a speech to a bunch of Boy Scouts   you know, children. In that speech, instead of inspiring them and being a role model, Trump chose to swear, re-litigate his Electoral College victory, talk about cocktail parties, and rant about political issues. Of course, this is a stunningly inappropriate speech for any adult to give to little kids, much less for someone in Trump s position to do it.There have been many responses to this insanity, but perhaps the best one came from Pete Souza, the enthusiastic photographer in the Obama White House. Souza s Instagram account has become a goldmine of images trolling Trump s most outrageous moments, and this one was no different.

Plus, when it comes to character, Obama exudes what the Scouts strive to be, while Trump is everything they don t want anyone to be.The striking part of all of this, though, is to show just how low we have gone as a country to have this orange fascist and his goons running it. Trump is racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, vindictive, a bully, and a con man. On the other side of that, President Obama was easily one of the most extraordinary human beings to ever hold that office.

"July 25, 2016","If this keeps up there won t be enough Republicans left to justify the existence of the party.Utah GOP state Senator Mark Madsen attended the Republican National Convention last week and witnessed his state make every effort to keep Donald Trump from becoming the nominee. But they failed, and Trump gave a gloom and doom acceptance speech formally making him the leader of a party coming apart at the seams.In the wake of the disappointing convention, Madsen decided that the time was right to bolt from the Republican Party because  every decision and inclination I had before was reinforced. Although Madsen claims that Trump s nomination isn t what ultimately changed his mind, it s kind of hard to believe that it wasn t a factor. After all, the longtime Utah Republican has concerns about Trump s inexperience.In fact, Madsen bizarrely claimed that he is leaving the party because it is somehow too progressive, therefore, he has decided to join the Libertarian Party, which apparently frowns upon progress.He also said the Republican Party  makes me want to cry because I ve invested a lot in that party. Libertarian Party Chairman Nicholas Sarwark did not refrain from bashing the Republican Party and said that the reality clown show is what is causing many Republican lawmakers to abandon ship. After the disaster that we saw in Cleveland, in which a party that was once storied has nominated a reality show star for president, where the convention chairman s cutting off the microphone of a sitting U.S. senator, it s broken,  Sarwark said.  It s fundamentally broken and it s dying. Even Madsen s own wife is voting against the Republican Party and she also had no problem blaming the convention for her decision. That was my tribe,  Erin Madsen said.  That was my people.   I believed deeply in what I thought the Republican Party believed. But after having gone to the convention in Cleveland, I don t think that s my tribe anymore. They don t believe what I believe. And you re going to think this is crazy but it s like a death in the family for me. It breaks my heart. Here s video of Madsen announcing his switch via YouTube.Last week, a lifelong Texas Republican formally resigned from the Republican Party by writing an epic resignation letter that went viral. I will not contribute my name, my work, or my character to an utterly indefensible cause,  Chris Ladd wrote after being a Republican for the last 30 years.  No sensible adult demands moral purity from a political party, but conscience is meaningless without constraints. A party willing to lend its collective capital to Donald Trump has entered a compromise beyond any credible threshold of legitimacy. There is no redemption in being one of the  good Nazis.

"July 26, 2016","Fox News  most popular prime time host, Bill O Reilly, responded to First Lady Michelle Obama s speech at the 2016 Democratic Convention and ended up defending the practice of slavery.Responding to Mrs. Obama s comment during her address that she lived in a White House  built by slaves,  O Reilly referred to himself as a  history teacher  and argued that the slaves who worked on the White House were  well fed  and  had decent lodgings provided by the government. O Reilly also said in his commentary,  Michelle Obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the White House, but there were others working as well. In the day after Obama s speech, other conservatives amazingly criticized the First Lady, trying to play  gotcha  on her remarks   which were actually a positive statement about America, pointing out the progress from slavery to a black First Family.The fact-checking site Politifact even had to release a report in response to these conservative complaints, including some who said the building was not worked on by slaves. They rated the First Lady s speech as  True. Journalist Jesse J. Holland also discussed the role of slaves in building the White House in his 2016 book, The Invisibles: The Untold Story of African American Slaves in the White House. With the invention of steam shovels still several years away, these slaves dug for the clay on site with hand shovels, working day and night to get the raw material to the skilled brick makers and at the same time, opening up ground on the site for the space that would become the White House s foundation and cellar,  Holland wrote. The identity of these slaves and where they came from has been lost, he wrote.Obama s statement is  true,  Holland told PolitiFact.The Obamas have driven the conservative movement crazy. No matter what they are for, the right finds a way to support the opposite. Even the indefensible.Featured image via screen capture", WATCH: Fox News Host DEFENDS Slavery In Bizarre Rant
"July 26, 2017","While it s sometimes difficult to keep up with all the legal hot water Donald Trump is in, one lawsuit predates even his Russian troubles and now Trump wants to put an end to lawsuits like it.For years, Trump peddled his supposed real estate expertise in a scheme called Trump University, which is not a university and it s really not Trump. In the end, 6,000 people sued Trump in a class action lawsuit. They claim that the promised Donald Trump investment techniques were mostly stuff that you could find on the Internet, some of which was illegal in some of the states where the seminars took place,  she said.  They say that the promised mentoring was worthless or nonexistent, that the instructors were unqualified and that they were definitely not handpicked by Donald Trump, as he claimed. And transcripts of Donald Trump s deposition   confirm that he was relatively unengaged with what went on in Trump University. Source: NPRThey won $25 million and now, Trump wants to put an end to class action lawsuits altogether, which would free corporations to screw their customers with very little accountability.While the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a new rule that would ban mandatory arbitration clauses, and would instead allow consumers to sue banks when they are wronged, the White House came out with a statement saying that when consumers sue, it s frivolous. If allowed to take effect, the CFPB s harmful rule would benefit trial lawyers by increasing frivolous class-action lawsuits; harm consumers by denying them the full benefits and efficiencies of arbitration; and hurt financial institutions by increasing litigation expenses and compliance costs (particularly for community and mid-sized institutions),  the White House said in a statement.Source: The WeekMandatory arbitration, while it might sound efficient, is rarely customer friendly. Most arbitrators are paid by the institution and in most cases, what they say is legally binding. Most of the time, the arbitrators rule in favor of the institution.In a sample of 19,300 cases, arbitrators ruled in favor of consumers 5 percent of the time. Meanwhile, arbitration firms used by companies such as MasterCard, Visa, Discover Financial Services and American Express Co. won 95 percent of the disputes, the study showed.Source: Seattle PIFrivolous, like when Donald Trump sued a man for daring to be born with the name Donald Trump, or when he sued a Miss USA contestant, or when he sued the Chicago Tribune for doubting Trump s Chicago building would eclipse the then Sears (and now Willis) Tower.Altogether, Trump has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits, but despite the fact that our taxpayers pay for courts, he wants to take the option to use them away from us, unless we can afford pricey attorneys.Class action lawsuits are democratic; they give the people a voice. In Trump s and in Republicans  world, though, consumer rights are inconvenient for profits. We should just shut up and when a bank-salaried arbitrator tells us we need to take it up the you-know-what, we d better take it up the you-know-what.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Trump Is Trying To Make It Illegal For Groups Of People He’s Screwed To Sue Him
"July 27, 2016","Everyone paying attention to the 2016 presidential election, regardless of politics, realizes that Donald Trump is not fit to hold the office he seeks. The man is clearly dangerously unqualified to take the oath of the presidency, and the idea that he might do so in January is absolutely terrifying.Well, the Democrats have put together a star-studded event to make sure that voters understand what is at stake here, and to make sure that people vote blue from the top on down this November, and one such star was none other then Vice President Joe Biden. VP Biden is likeable, adorable, smart, charming and funny. He s also incredibly knowledgeable. He knows what he is talking about, and he knows that the difference between the two choices this year is like night and day. Here is what Biden said, in part, to make his case against Trump, via Daily Kos:Let me say this as clearly as I can, if you live in the neighborhoods like the ones Jill and I grew up in, if you worry about your job and getting a decent pay, if you worry about your children s education, if you are taking care of an elderly parent, then there is only one person in the selection will help you, only one person in this race who will be there, who has always been there for you and that is Hillary Clinton s life story. Not just who she is, it is her life story. [Cheers] She is always there. She has always been there. [Cheers] And so has Tim kaine. [Cheers]Ladies and gentlemen, let s say the obvious, I really meant, that is not Donald Trump story. Just listen to me a second without doing or cheering.  Booing or cheering, his cynicism is undoubtedly his lack of empathy and compassion can be summed up in that phrase he is most proud of making famous, you re fired. I m not joking. Think about that. Think about that. Think about everything you learned as a child. No matter where you were raised, how can there be pleasure in saying you re fired? He is trying to tell us he cares about the middle class. Give me a break. That is a bunch of malarkey. [Cheers]Whatever he thinks, whatever he thinks, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, I know I m called middle-class Joe and in Washington, that is not meant as a compliment. It means you are not sophisticated. I know why we are strong, I know why we are held together, I know why we are united, it is because there has always been a growing middle class. This guy does not have a clue about the middle class. Not a clue. [Cheers] Because folks, when the hill class   middle class does well, the rich do very well and the poor have hope. They have a way out. He has no clue about what makes America great. Actually, he has no clue period. [Cheers]Not a clue! Not a clue! Not a clue!Folks, let me say, let me say something that has nothing to do with politics. Let me talk about something that I m deadly serious about. This is a complicated and uncertain world we live in. The threats are two great   too great, the times are too uncertain to elect Donald Trump as resident of the united States. Let me finish, no major party, no major party nominee in the history of the station has ever known less or been less prepared to do with our national security  deal with our national  security.Our vice president is right. This is not about politics anymore. Trump is incompetent, and dangerously so. He has no clue about the economy, national security, or anything else. He doesn t understand what makes the nation function, even on the most basic level, and he certainly doesn t understand what makes it great. The choice is clear, my fellow Americans. Vote for a demagogue who peddles in hate and fear who is completely unprepared to occupy the Oval Office, or vote for the woman who knows what she is doing and will continue to KEEP America great.Watch Vice President Biden s incredible speech below:Featured image via video screen capture"," Joe Biden DESTROYS Trump In Fiery DNC Speech: Hillary Gets It, Trump – Not A Clue (VIDEO)"
"July 27, 2017","You thought the people passing through Fargo, North Dakota were crazy. Now we have to worry about wood chippers in the Wal-Mart parking lot.On Tuesday, genuinely terrifying racist Amber E. Hensley confronted some Muslim women who she felt had  parked too close  for her to get in her car, although vehicle proximity may not have been the only factor, it appears. In mere moments, the disagreement turned into death threats against sisters Sarah and Laleyla Hassan and another passenger in their car, Rowda Soyan. All are Somali-American Muslims.The trio was on their way to see a movie, Raw Story reports, when they were approached by Hensley, who shouted at them through the window of their car. After exchanging taunts about who was or was not an American, the sister with the camera, Sarah, asked the woman  what are you gonna do?  Hensley leaned in and told the young women just what her intentions were: We re gonna kill all of ya. We re gonna kill every one of you fuckin  Muslims.Later, she asked the would-be moviegoers  why are you in our country, anyway? Hensley was fired nearly as soon as the video went public. From a statement issued by Horab & Wentz, the accounting firm where she previously worked:The women, of course, disagreed about what happened when the camera wasn t rolling. After her firing, Amber Hensley posted an  apology  on her now-deleted Facebook page:In an interview with the Twin Cities Pioneer Press, Sarah Hassan denied ever having insulted Jesus.We Muslims, we believe in Jesus, too. If I abuse Jesus it s like I m abusing my own god and I not going to be considered a Muslim.This is a common mistake among Christians who don t know anything about Islam. There are a great many parallels between the two Abrahamic religions, although names differ between them. In addition to lying about what Sarah said, Sarah claims that Hensley also mocked her sister Lalelya s crossed eyes and said it was the reason the women were parked so poorly.Amber Hensley was, of course, a big fan of Donald Trump:Trump may have said some things years ago  But Hilary has BLOOD on her hands!

"July 28, 2016","Khizr Khan, the father of a slain purple-heart winning Muslim soldier absolutely laid into Donald Trump in his speech on the final night of the 2016 Democratic Convention in Philadelphia.Khan s son, Captain Humayun S. M. Khan, was one of 14 American Muslims who have died while serving the United States military since 9/11.Standing next to his wife, Mr. Khan laid into Trump for arguing for a wall between America and Mexico, pointing out,  We cannot solve our problems by building walls We are stronger together. Pointing out Trump s incendiary anti-Muslim rhetoric, the father asked,  Let me ask [Trump], have you even read the United States Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy! He then dramatically reached into his jacket and pulled out his Constitution.Concluding his speech, Khan gave a full-throated endorsement of Hillary Clinton:  Vote for the healer not the divider. Their son was killed when a suicide bomber attacked his unit, serving in Iraq in 2004.Captain Khan was killed just north of Baghdad on June 8, 2004. A car approached the gates of the base he was tasked with protecting. As soldiers under Khan s command prepared to inspect the vehicle, his father told us, Captain Khan screamed for his men to  hit the dirt  and walked towards it himself and demanded the driver stop. Inside the car were two suicide bombers and a large amount of explosives. As the car reached the gate, the bomb was detonated, killing Khan and wounding 10 U.S. soldiers. His father believes many more men might have died without Khan s warning. Khan was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, two of the military s highest honors.The divisive nature of Trump s repeated attacks on Muslims has prompted the Khans to speak out against his candidacy for the presidency, and it resulted in an epic moment at the convention.Featured image via YouTube"," WATCH: Father Of Purple Heart-Winning Muslim Soldier UNLEASHES On Trump, And It Is Amazing"
"July 28, 2017","One of the things that has plagued America   besides Donald Trump himself   is the POTUS  Twitter usage. Every day, Trump s Twitter account serves as an endless amount of humiliation and chaos for a country that was once well-respected around the world. While Trump has proven to his staff (and the country) that he cannot be controlled on social media, a federal court may have just ruled that there are some things he just CANNOT do on Twitter.One of Trump s most disturbing behaviors lies in his tendency to block people on Twitter just because they disagree with him. Currently, Trump is being sued by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University for blocking people just because they expressed criticism. Thanks to a federal court ruling that happened this week, Trump may not be able to do that anymore.This week, a federal court ruled on a case very similar to Trump s, in which the chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, Phyllis J. Randall, had been blocking constituents on her public Facebook page. In the case Davison v. Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, Randall wrote on her county Facebook page, I really want to hear from ANY Loudoun citizen on ANY issues, request, criticism, compliment, or just your thoughts.  When Brian C. Davidson took her up on her offer, bringing up the alleged corruption in the county s school board, Randall responded by deleting his comment and blocking him. The following morning, Randall unblocked Davidson but he was not able to comment on her page or send her messages. Davidson argued that this was a violation of his freedom of speech, and a federal court ruled in his favor.U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled that this was a violation of the First Amendment s Free Speech Clause because Randall was  offended by his criticism of her colleagues in the County government , which he regarded as unconstitutional  viewpoint discrimination    pretty much what Trump does on Twitter. Cacheris explained:Defendant s offense at Plaintiff s views was therefore an illegitimate basis for her actions particularly given that Plaintiff earned Defendant s ire by criticizing the County government. Indeed, the suppression of critical commentary regarding elected officials is the quintessential form of viewpoint discrimination against which the First Amendment guards. By prohibiting Plaintiff from participating in her online forum because she took offense at his claim that her colleagues in the County government had acted unethically, Defendant committed a cardinal sin under the First Amendment.This certainly has implications to what might happen with Trump s own Twitter account. While Trump might try to argue that his personal Twitter page   separate from the @POTUS presidential account   is not intended to function as a public forum, it s obvious that Trump uses it to make presidential announcements. Members of his own team, such as former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, have even stated that Trump s tweets are  official statements    which means this account should be subjected to the same rules as Randall s public Facebook page was.Featured image via Steve Pope / Getty Images", Federal Court Rules Against Trump’s Unpresidential Twitter Behavior (DETAILS)
"July 29, 2016","By now, all of us know that Trump is a complete a**hole. Even his brainless, delusional supporters are aware of this, and it s one of the things they love most about him. Perhaps this is the only thing we ll ever agree on when it comes to Trump   that the guy is just a total douchebag. But according to some recent comments, there s actually one person who thinks Trump has been pleasant and nice so far in this campaign   Donald Trump himself.Just a day after Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wrapped up her wildly successful and historical Democratic National Convention, Trump channeled his jealousy and rage into a ridiculous speech while at a rally in Colorado. Implying that Trump felt he s been nothing but cordial this far, the brash business mogul said: I m taking the gloves off. Take the gloves off. Right? Taking the gloves off! Just remember this: Trump is gonna be no more Mr. Nice Guy. This of course, follows the epic temper tantrum Trump threw on Twitter. Trump got himself all riled up as his rant continued, begging his followers to  Tell Hillary I m not gonna be nice anymore    as if Clinton has somehow mistaken Trump for a genuine, honest and friendly human being. He spewed: I ve been very nice to her. So you ready? Actually, some of the folks I defeated they probably would say,  Boy, he was not very nice. They keep screaming. And you know what I do? I ve been nice. But after watching that performance last night   such lies   I don t have to be so nice anymore. Obviously threatened by how much Clinton is being praised not only by Democrats but by Republicans as well, Trump used one of the only things he could against her by bringing up her email scandal, which has already been cleared by the FBI several times. Trump said: I ve been saying let s just beat her on Nov. 8, but you know what? You know what? I m starting to agree with you, I ll tell you. Sorry to say. You can watch Trump s speech below:It s hard to imagine how Trump is going to manage being more offensive and awful, but he has always managed to up the ante in the past, so it looks like we re going to find out.

"July 3, 2016","Californians have a choice ahead of them. In November, citizens of the Golden State will decide whether or not to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes.  One of the most compelling arguments proponents of marijuana legalization have used in previous efforts to legalize marijuana in other states, is that it will bring in extra money for the state s budget.On that front, there is plenty of evidence to support that argument. Oregon saw a jaw-dropping amount of extra revenue after they legalized marijuana. Officials in Oregon expected to bring in $2 million dollars in tax revenue after their first year of legal weed. They nearly doubled their expectation bringing in an astounding $3.48 million dollars in new tax revenue.So how much is California expected to bring in should they choose to legalize recreational marijuana? Reuters reports that California could take in an additional $1 billion dollars a year: With a population of nearly 40 million people, and a thriving medical marijuana trade legalized 20 years ago, California already has the United States  largest legal marijuana market. Legalization of recreational pot would generate an estimated $1 billion in additional taxes per year. Other states that have legalized recreational marijuana have received similar tax windfalls. Colorado, the first state in the U.S. to legalize marijuana, took in $135 million dollars in taxes and fees in 2015. Colorado is pumping most of their new tax dollars into schools and other education initiatives.The state of Washington raised $67.5 million dollars in tax revenue from recreational marijuana in 2015. They are expected to raise more than $1 billion dollars over four years. This money goes into Washington s general fund and to help fund health services.Legalizing marijuana would also save California a lot of money due to no longer having to pay the enormous cost of enforcing current marijuana laws. In 2012, over 21,000 people were arrested for crimes related to marijuana criminalization. The number of overall arrests   especially felony arrests   has plummeted over the years after changes were made to the California s marijuana laws. However, the cost both budgetary and human of marijuana criminalization is still a huge financial burden for the citizens of California to bear.It s time for California, as well as the rest of the nation for that matter, to end marijuana prohibition once and for all. We cannot afford not to.Featured image from David McNew/Getty Images", Here’s How Much California Would Bring In Every Year If They Legalize Marijuana

"July 30, 2017","Donald Trump made became a household name in the 80s after pretending to write a book called  The Art of the Deal.  After that, his reputation was sealed as a great negotiator   or so his followers thought.That illusion was shattered on Friday, though, after the Senate failed to pass its latest attempt at repealing Obamacare. Despite Trump s last minute appeal to John McCain, McCain became one of three Republicans who are credited with killing the bill.It turns out that the real deal-maker in this scenario was our former Vice President. Joe Biden called his friend and former colleague before the vote. Former Senator Joe Lieberman did the same.While we don t know what Trump said to McCain that apparently had no effect, one of the reasons it fell on deaf ears is Trump s blatant insincerity. On the campaign trial, Trump disparaged McCain, saying he preferred people who weren t captured   referring to the fact that McCain was captured by North Vietnamese and held and tortured in a POW camp for 5 1/5 years.Before the vote, and after McCain had voted to let the vote go forward, Trump tweeted that McCain was a hero.Biden s call may or may not have been the deciding factor in McCain s vote, but you can be sure it was more meaningful than Trump s. Biden, unlike Trump, can be kind and diplomatic, even when there are political disagreements. Biden is capable of emotional appeals, simply because he experiences empathy, something Trump completely lacks. Biden also has first-hand experience with the kind of brain cancer for which McCain is currently undergoing treatment. He lost his son to it. You can be sure that Biden, in his heartfelt way, helped convince McCain that no one should be denied treatment for such a cruel disease.The Post reported that Biden had a more emotional discussion with McCain, reflecting on his son Beau Biden s death to the same brain cancer McCain was diagnosed with earlier this month.

"July 31, 2016","When Khizr Khan took the stage at the DNC to give a heartfelt speech about the very real sacrifice his Muslim son made in Iraq, and to call out Trump on his anti-Muslim hatred as the height of insult against people like Capt. Khan, many probably expected the GOP to hop on board and repudiate Trump. After all, insulting those who fight to keep us safe from terrorism is just sick and wrong.It seems now that we ll all be waiting a long time to hear them do that. House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have indeed issued statements against Trump, but they re so weak and watery that they re meaningless, empty gestures.McConnell said: Captain Khan was an American hero, and like all Americans I m grateful for the sacrifices that selfless young men like Capt. Khan and their families have made in the war on terror. All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services. And as I have long made clear, I agree with the Khans and families across the country that a travel ban of all members of a religion is simply contrary to American values. Some of that is word-salady enough to make us tilt our heads and think,  Say what?  Ultimately, though, McConnell got what he deserved from the Twitterverse. They see right through the meaninglessness of this statement, particularly because it s paired with the GOP s continuing endorsement of Trump.    Paul Ryan s statement wasn t much better. He said:  America s greatness is built on the principles of liberty and preserved by the men and women who wear the uniform to defend it. As I have said on numerous occasions, a religious test for entering our country is not reflective of these fundamental values. I reject it. Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example. His sacrifice and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan should always be honored. Period. His statement is clearer, but no less empty than McConnell s. Twitter saw right through him, too.     Given that Trump has since insulted both Khizr and his wife publicly, instead of apologizing to a grieving family for his cold-hearted fuckery, it s more important than ever for the GOP to publicly reject him. In fact, Khizr has pleaded with them to do just that. They won t, though. These statements make that clear.The only way for Republicans to prove that Trump doesn t speak for them on this issue is to directly and bluntly reject him, since he obviously doesn t represent American values. They should have done this months ago, and they didn t because they re impotent. Now they re stuck supporting Trump, which makes them the party of all the hate Trump spews forth from his black and shriveled soul.Image of Paul Ryan by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.

It would be great if you could make it, I promise food of at least comparible (sic) quality to that which we ate in Iraq. Should be a great evening. Bossert returned the email to the Kushner imposter, and even gave the person his own email address: Thanks, Jared. With a promise like that, I can t refuse. Also, if you ever need it, my personal email is  (redacted).Here is an image of the exchange, via CNN:Now, this guy is in charge of advising the loons in the White House on how to keep us safe. Yet, he was too dumb to realize that this was a hoax, likely for kicks, as the rest of the world is laughing at the clown car that is the Trump Administration. Think about that, and be absolutely terrified.They also got freshly fired White House Communications Director Anthony  The Mooch  Scaramucci. From CNN: I had promised myself I would leave my hands mud free,  wrote the fake Priebus,  but after reading your tweet today which stated how;  soon we will learn who in the media who has class, and who hasn t , has pushed me to this. That tweet was breathtakingly hypocritical, even for you. At no stage have you acted in a way that s even remotely classy, yet you believe that s the standard by which everyone should behave towards you? General Kelly will do a fine job. I ll even admit he will do a better job than me. But the way in which that transition has come about has been diabolical. And hurtful. I don t expect a reply. None of these people should be anywhere near our government, and yet they are running the whole damn thing.

"July 4, 2016","Donald Trump is an embarrassment to the GOP and, more importantly, to the nation. He is also the most outrageously dangerous major party presidential candidate that America has seen in recent memory   perhaps ever. Well, many people on both the left and the right know this, and have jumped on the #NeverTrump train. Now, there is a very interesting development: a group of women who have been lifelong Republicans doing all they can to elect presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton.The group is calling itself  Republican Women for Hillary,  and spent their 4th of July evening holding the first meeting of their fledgling organization at Washington s St. Regis Hotel. These women are definitely not your typical Hillary supporters. One of them admittedly spent copious amounts of time campaigning against abortion rights, and another is a Southern Baptist who is basically against everything Hillary Clinton and Democrats in general stand for. However, their mission is to make sure Donald Trump never gets anywhere near the Oval Office   even if it means doing all they can to elect Hillary Clinton.U.S. Chamber of Commerce employee and staunch Republican Jennifer Lim, who helped found the group, explains the logic: It s really important that Republican leaders, especially Republican women leaders, stand up right now and say we re not OK with Trump representing our party. This is not a position I ever wanted to find myself in. But it s important that when things like this happen that people speak up. It is important to note that this group is in no way affiliated with the Clinton campaign, but they do intend to do their own campaigning and activist activities, including urging people to vote for Clinton, while also helping conservatives facing political backlash for condemning Donald Trump and his destructive, dangerous campaign.Here is the tweet from the group s twitter, endorsing Clinton:We're with her! #GOPwithHer #ImWithHer https://t.co/FhKIaa6BX5  RWFH (@GOPWomenWithHer) June 7, 2016Meghan Milloy, who is a member of Republican Woman for Hillary but also works for a conservative think tank called American Action Forum, seems conflicted and it is clear the decision was not easy to join this group. However, her resolve is solid. She says:  It has been tough for me to come to this point where I can vote for a candidate who has been very against what I ve been working for for most of my professional career. That being said, I can t vote for someone like Donald Trump because he s overtly racist and misogynist. Jennifer Lim goes on to clarify the group s position: Are you a Republican who thinks @realDonaldTrump should not become president?Tell us why: https://t.co/OvwepPNXoC  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 6, 2016Featured image via David McNew/Getty Images", Meet The Brave Republican Women Who Are Supporting Clinton In The Boldest #NeverTrump Move Yet
"July 4, 2017","The Donald Trump Administration has to be the whiniest in history. Of course, they are all a bunch of spoiled, moneyed, grown up brats, so this is no surprise. Once a trust fund baby who appreciates nothing and was born with a silver spoon in your mouth, and there s no turning back. You either become a decent person because you had decent parents and morals and values plus a basic sense of awareness and decency yourself, or you become a rich asshole. Trump being Trump, of course, picked other rich assholes like himself. Case in point   United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley.Now, I know that Haley is awful. I live in South Carolina and lived under the tyranny of her governorship until Trump scooped her up to work in his administration. Therefore, her 4th of July tweet came as no surprise to me. Since the nutjob who runs North Korea is an ever-increasing nuclear threat, all relevant hands had to be on deck on Independence Day, since there had been yet another North Korean ballistic missile test less than 24 hours before. This one is especially grave, since there is every possibility that it could strike our nation. However, what is Nikki Haley worried about? Certainly not Kim Jung-un. No. She is worried about having to work on the holiday. Ambassador Haley tweeted:Spending my 4th in meetings all day. #ThanksNorthKorea  Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) July 4, 2017Luckily, the good people of Twitter were on the job for this one, as per usual.

"July 5, 2016","Donald Trump held a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina on Tuesday night and once again his habit of simply saying what s on his mind led him to step in it. He decided that, while discussing terrorism, to praise a man once called  the Butcher of Baghdad,  Saddam Hussein.Sweet Moses  pic.twitter.com/fL1u9R6VXm  Jim Weber (@JimMWeber) July 6, 2016While conceding that Hussein was  a bad guy,  Trump praised him for killing terrorists, a job he did  well. Apparently citing a Middle Eastern dictator as his model for combating international terrorism, Trump went on to praise Iraq under Hussein s iron fisted rule as a nation that didn t bother with reading rights to accused suspects.Moving forward to the current time, Trump said that Iraq in 2016 was  like Harvard  for terrorists. Like many of his other speeches outside of those delivered with a teleprompter, it didn t make much sense.When Saddam Hussein was captured by the U.S. after the invasion of Iraq, he was put on trial and accused of the murder of 148 people, torture of women and children, and with illegally arresting at least 399 people. He was found guilty of crimes against humanity, and was sentenced to death and hanged.Trump has consistently made a mess of speaking about terrorism, arguing for waterboarding (which military experts say is a useless tool for extracting information and is considered torture under the Geneva Conventions) and for engaging in the barbaric practice of murdering the families of terrorists, even if they had nothing to do with terrorist acts.The Republican nominee has also played fast and loose with the facts on terrorism, blaming the Orlando attack on Syrian refugees when the shooter was a natural-born American citizen. Trump has also been at the head of the line on the right that has blamed all terrorism on Muslims, and called for a ban on Muslim travel to the United States and a system to track Muslims within the United States.Trump s supporters have cheered on his advocacy of big brother, fascist policies, with some going so far as to refer to Trump as  daddy,  for the paternalistic world view he has offered many of them who are skeptical of a black President.In reality, President Obama has had more senior leadership within terror networks like al Qaeda and ISIS targeted and killed during his tenure than his predecessor. In Obama s time as commander-in-chief, American forces killed Osama bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour.Featured image via Twitter", WATCH: Trump Caught On Video Praising One Of The Worst Dictators Of All Time
"July 5, 2017","Donald Trump s obsession with Twitter and inability to concentrate on any concept more complex than a sentence or two is now being put to use by his desperate staff.Trump is about to embark on a high-stakes, crucial sitdown with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Europe. Unfortunately for America, he cannot concentrate on learning anything before he goes. Trump is infamous for refusing to read intelligence briefings (or read anything, really), but his lack of focus has only gotten worse as his poll numbers slide and his petty fights with morning show hosts and his golf trips consume most of his days.His frantic staff is down to one last move to get him to read a few facts before sitting down with Putin. What follows is one of, perhaps, the most pathetic things you ll ever read.Here s what sources told the LA Times about how Trump s team is getting the president to read up on the adversary who interfered in the 2016 presidential election just months ago:The profile, according to two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the preparations, is part of a thick binder prepared for Trump. The president often doesn t read the usual briefing books and relies on in-person briefings, the officials said, so aides also have written a list of tweet-length sentences that summarize the main points Trump could bring up with Putin.Having thoroughly killed the reputation of the White House in a variety of ways, Trump now isn t even expected to read anything longer than a tweet. And his Republican allies in Congress don t seem to find anything wrong with that.There is a growing sense, both in Washington and around the country, that the executive branch no longer functionally exists. Trump watches an estimated 5 hours of television a day. He tweets at his enemies, sometimes using memes created by racists and which made their way to his desk in mysterious, disturbing ways. He visits his properties and golfs. The rare time staff can get him to actually work on something gets derailed by Trump s incessant ego and casual obliviousness. His staff is now encouraged to bring up Trump and his election win as often as possible. They are told to not contradict him when he says something factually untrue. Sometimes he ll leave Fox News running in the background while his staff tries to conduct business.Even that was too much work, apparently. Now he needs 140 characters or less or his mind will wander to right-wing memes and personal attacks on his enemies. And he appears to be getting worse.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images", WH Starts Condensing Intel Briefings Into Tweet Form In Desperate Move To Get Trump To Read Them
"July 6, 2016","Donald Trump s antics at a campaign rally on Wednesday night were completely and totally unhinged, even adjusting for the strange standards of Donald Trump. Despite media claims that Trump was making a  pivot  towards more seriousness and substance, and the belief that new communications hires would keep Trump more on message, he was a wild man once again.Seemingly out of nowhere, Trump began a riff on how much he hates mosquitoes.Trump doesn't like mosquitoes (in Cincinnati, OH at the Sharonville Convention Center) pic.twitter.com/ZQY0pywHKi  Marcus DiPaola (@marcusdipaola) July 7, 2016Using a weird voice, Trump said,  I don t want mosquitoes around me.  He then slapped at a mosquito on his podium and screamed,  I DON T LIKE MOSQUITOES. I don t like those mosquitoes, I never did. Speaking of mosquitoes, oh hello Hillary how are you doing,  he concluded, before moving on to another topic.Republicans have noted that instead of squeezing some mileage out of the critical FBI press conference on Hillary Clinton s emails, Trump has stumbled from one controversy to the next. First his campaign tweeted anti-semitic imagery about Clinton that they deleted, then he praised Saddam Hussein at a campaign rally, and has now appointed himself the bug-hunter-in-chief.Trump s problem appears to be that he is relying on the headline-grabbing antics of his campaign that worked so well for him against the Republican field. But in the general election, against a candidate in Hillary Clinton who doesn t have to pander to racists, the bombastic Trump style is appearing more and more like a dud.And Trump s antics easily ally him with an existing frame for his campaign that has been exploited by Democrats. Both Clinton and President Obama have invoked the need for a steady hand over the launch codes for America s nuclear launch codes, and contrasted that need to Trump s public rhetoric.The candidate clearly believes he can  wing it  on the way to the White House, but general election audiences are not nearly as enraptured with Trump s antics as Republicans were.Featured image via Twitter", MUST WATCH: This Trump Video May Prove He’s Finally Lost His Mind
"July 6, 2017","House Speaker Paul Ryan s office is throwing yet another obstacle in the way of the free press, but this one only affects female reporters. Women who dare wear sleeveless tops or dresses during blistering hot D.C. weather are being turned away from House press gatherings   all for the perceived sin of showing their shoulders. Sharia Law anyone?According to numerous reporters, women have been barred from the Speaker s lobby for wearing sleeveless dresses and blouses. CBS reports that recently,  a young, female reporter  tried to enter the Speaker s lobby a room outside of the House chamber where reporters generally ask legislators questions but was turned away because the sleeveless dress she was wearing  was considered inappropriate because her shoulders weren t covered. The unnamed reporter, apparently desperate to simply do her job,  ripped out pages from her notebook and stuffed them into her dress s shoulder openings to create sleeves,  CBS reports. Her improvised outfit was still deemed unacceptable and she was turned away. At least three reporters confirmed that they had received a warning about the apparently arbitrary dress code. One report, Independent Journal Review s Haley Byrd told CBS that she was kicked out of the Speaker s lobby in May the same day House Republicans passed their health care bill for wearing a sleeveless dress. On Twitter, two reporters confirmed that either they or colleagues had been barred or warned for daring to bare their shoulders.Source: Jezebellittle bitch paul ryan is scared of women s shoulders ahhh the horror!!!! https://t.co/PN2wOPvCyr  eve peyser (@evepeyser) July 6, 2017Paul Ryan should just stop shilly-shallying around and order all women to wear full burqas https://t.co/n7G163iGil  Hadley Freeman (@HadleyFreeman) July 6, 2017No sleeveless dresses are allowed on Capitol Hill because if Paul Ryan can t show off his arms, no one can. pic.twitter.com/ZWzmhoPsEP  Matt Fernandez (@FattMernandez) July 6, 2017My mom has a button that says  Fuck Paul Ryan  She wears it on her sleeveless top  NorahBrink (@nbrink77) July 6, 2017Sure, if a man showed up with a wife beater, he d probably be kicked out of the House too, but sleeveless has long been an acceptable choice among professional women, especially during hot weather.Ryan s office didn t issue a reason for the arbitrary interpretation of the existing dress code, which is simply that reporters wear  appropriate attire.  It s not a big leap, though, to say that they are trying to de-sexualize women. Not only are they banning sleeveless attire, but they re also banning open-toed shoes.Remember, this is the party that tries to claim moral superiority over Muslims because (in part) of the strict dress codes among women in some Islamic countries.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images", Women Reporters Are Being Turned Away From Covering Congress; Here’s Why
"July 7, 2016","Minnesota governor Mark Dayton believes that Philando Castile was killed because he was a black man. The governor made his point of view crystal clear in public statements given on Thursday. Would this have happened if those passengers, the driver were white?  he asked.  I don t think it would have. Dayton said he has spoken with Minnesota s senators, Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, and the area s House representatives and would be demanding a Justice Department investigation. I can t say how shocked I am and deeply, deeply offended that this would happen to somebody in Minnesota,  Dayton said grimly.  No one should be shot in Minnesota for a taillight being out of function. No one should be killed in Minnesota while seated in their car. Castile was shot and killed in the city of Falcon Heights after he was pulled over for a supposed broken taillight. As his girlfriend sat in the passenger seat and his 4-year-old daughter sat in the back, the police officer shot into the car. According to his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, Castile complied with the officer s demands as he approached the vehicle.Castile told the cop he had a license to carry a concealed weapon, but was killed before he could produce it.In the video the cop can be seen freaking out, immediately after the shooting.The aftermath of the incident was streamed on Reynolds  Facebook Live account, and sparked protests in Minnesota and elsewhere in America on Thursday. President Obama highlighted the case, along with the shooting death of Alton Sterling.The cases have brought the Black Lives Matter movement back to the front burner, though for black Americans the forever present threat of death from police officers has never gone away.Despite their advocacy in favor of concealed carry laws, the NRA has refused to comment on Castile s death.

"July 7, 2017","House Speaker Paul Ryan finally admitted the reason he is refusing to hold town hall meetings: He s too afraid of protesters. Speaking at a Boy Scouts event in Wisconsin, Ryan told the crowd that he just doesn t have the guts to face his own constituents when he knows they are p*ssed that he s trying to steal their health care. Aside from the obvious security concerns, what we have found is there are people who are trying to come in from out of the district to disrupt town hall meetings and not have a civil discussion, so what I have been doing is looking for new and creative ways to interact with my constituents in a civil way,  Ryan said. That s why I have done a number of telephone town hall meetings, which I find very effective as people don t have to travel. I do office hours. I just did them this morning in Janesville. In addition, I am doing a lot of business ones,  the Speaker said.Ryan said that he has found other ways to meet with his constituents, like the town-hall style meeting he held on Thursday that was closed to the public with only 25 employees of the business he was touring in attendance. I find when you guys are there, people kind of clam up. They get a little nervous, but when you do business town halls without media it is very interactive, so I am finding a lot of different ways to have a good civil dialogue with constituents,  he continued.Ryan then said that if people want to talk to him, that s what his office hours are for, which he explained help keep him safe from all those big, mean protesters. Additionally, if you want to come do office hours, they schedule office hours because I don t want to have a situation where we just have a screaming fest, a shouting fest where people are being bussed in from out of the district to get on TV because they are yelling at somebody. That does nobody any good, and what I want to do is have a civil, good conversation with constituents, and that s why I do all these different things, whether it s planned tours, telephone town halls, office hours and the rest,  he said.So, that s Ryan s master plan to deal with the ever increasing public anger over his plan to take health care from millions.

Amid their messages of mourning and healing as a nation, members also demanded that congress finally hold a vote on several pieces of legislation that focus on tightening gun restrictions.Representative G.K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina and the chairman of the caucus, said that in the wake of the  despicable crimes  in Dallas, the Caucus was determined to continue  our fight to remove guns from the hands of terrorists and would-be criminals. We come to this place each week to represent our constituents who are in pain. As of June 30, just a few days ago, 491 Americans have been fatally shot by the police; most of those were African-American.Last night, despicable crimes were committed against Dallas police officers, and when the dust settled five of them were dead as a result of an organized execution by criminals who possess guns and use them to the extreme. And so the Congressional Black Caucus convenes today to say to America we are continuing our fight to remove guns from the hands of terrorists and would-be criminals.Democrats have been fighting for several pieces of legislation. These measures include an effort bolster mandatory background checks and  No Fly No Buy,  which would stop suspected terrorists on no-fly lists from being able to legally purchase guns. Republicans have staunchly refused to take any action on the measures.Republicans, what on Earth are you, why are you recoiling and not giving us a debate on gun violence?  Mr. Butterfield said.  Why are you recoiling and not giving us a debate on gun violence? Why not give it a hearing, give us a debate, give us an up-or-down vote on our legislation on gun violence? Why?Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, led last month s sit-in on the House floor over gun control legislation following the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando. He urged protesters to remain peaceful, preaching the non-violent ways of the Civil Rights movement, in which he was an influential leader.There s no room in our society for violence; we respect law enforcement. There needs to be greater training of law enforcement and sometimes I feel that maybe not only those of us that engage in nonviolent protest but police officers need to be taught the way of peace, the way of love, the way of nonviolence, to respect the dignity and the worth of every human being.It doesn t matter whether black or white, Latino, Asian-American or Native American; we are one family living in one house. We must learn to live together as brothers and sisters. If not, we will perish as fools. We have too many guns. There has been too much violence.

Even his own administration is publicly disagreeing with Trump and stating that Russia interfered with the election   and today, Trump s UN Ambassador humiliated him on national television over his infamous denial.In an interview with CNN, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley stated that  everybody knows  that Russia messed around with the election.

"July 9, 2016","Donald Trump likes to brag that he attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, but while he is proud of that, the students and faculty are embarrassed that he is an alumni.In an open letter, students and faculty both past and present condemned Trump for his hateful and bigoted rhetoric and expressed outrage that he is humiliating the school by associating it with his ignorance and intolerance and rejected his use of the school name in his campaign.Here s the full letter via Medium:At the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, students are taught to represent the highest levels of respect and integrity. We are taught to embrace humility and diversity. We can understand why, in seeking America s highest office, you have used your degree from Wharton to promote and lend legitimacy to your candidacy.As a candidate for President, and now as the presumptive GOP nominee, you have been afforded a transformative opportunity to be a leader on national and international stages and to make the Wharton community even prouder of our school and values.However, we have been deeply disappointed in your candidacy.We, proud students, alumni, and faculty of Wharton, are outraged that an affiliation with our school is being used to legitimize prejudice and intolerance. Although we do not aim to make any political endorsements with this letter, we do express our unequivocal stance against the xenophobia, sexism, racism, and other forms of bigotry that you have actively and implicitly endorsed in your campaign. The Wharton community is a diverse community. We are immigrants and children of immigrants, people of color, Muslims, Jews, women, people living with or caring for those with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ community. In other words, we represent the groups that you have repeatedly denigrated, as well as their steadfast friends, family, and allies.We recognize that we are fortunate to be educated at Wharton, and we are committed to using our opportunity to make America and the world a better place for everyone. We are dedicated to promoting inclusion not only because diversity and tolerance have been repeatedly proven to be valuable assets to any organization s performance, but also because we believe in mutual respect and human dignity as deeply held values. Your insistence on exclusion and scapegoating would be bad for business and bad for the American economy. An intolerant America is a less productive, less innovative, and less competitive America.We, the undersigned Wharton students, alumni, and faculty, unequivocally reject the use of your education at Wharton as a platform for promoting prejudice and intolerance. Your discriminatory statements are incompatible with the values that we are taught and we teach at Wharton, and we express our unwavering commitment to an open and inclusive American society.In addition, the authors of the letter spoke to NBC about their decision to write it. It was important for us to speak out against Trump because, as we have seen in many moments throughout history, silence is an act of complicity. This open letter speaks on behalf of Wharton students, alumni and faculty who wish to speak out against hate and stand in solidarity with all members of our diverse community   both at Wharton and across America. In short, Donald Trump just received a giant middle finger from the school and it s a safe bet that past faculty regret that he was ever allowed to step foot in their classrooms. Because every time Trump opens his mouth he makes it hard to believe that he could have ever actually earned a degree anywhere in the first place.Featured Image: Mark Lyons/Getty Images", Donald Trump’s Alma Mater Just Told Him To Go F*ck Himself

"Jun 1, 2015","How many American taxpayer dollars have already been used by the Obama regime to spy on, discredit and dismantle conservative groups like the Tea Party? Is anyone else beginning to feel like the Obama regime is one big union who forces members to pay dues that are used to fund, and ensure the success of the Democrat party? The Department of Justice is concentrating on  far-right  groups in a new study of social media usage aimed at combatting violent extremism.The Justice Department s National Institute of Justice (NIJ) awarded Michigan State University $585,719 for the study, which was praised by Eric Holder, the former attorney general, earlier this year. There is currently limited knowledge of the role of technology and computer mediated communications (CMCs), such as Facebook and Twitter, in the dissemination of messages that promote extremist agendas and radicalize individuals to violence,  according to the NIJ grant.  The proposed study will address this gap through a series of qualitative and quantitative analyses of posts from various forms of CMC used by members of both the far-right and Islamic extremist movements. The study draws more upon right-wing forums than upon the corners of the web inhabited by Islamist extremists. We will collect posts made in four active forums used by members of the far-right and three from the Islamic Extremist community, as well as posts made in Facebook, LiveJournal, Twitter, YouTube, and Pastebin accounts used by members of each movement,  the grant said. The findings will be used to document both the prevalence and variation in the ideological content of posts from members of each movement,  the grant continued.  In addition, we will assess the value of these messages in the social status of the individual posting the message and the function of radical messages in the larger on-line identity of participants in extremist communities generally. The project will also  identify the hidden networks of individuals who engage in extremist movements based on geographic location and ideological similarities. The results will be used for a public webinar, and for presentations for counterterrorism experts in the United States.Holder highlighted the study in remarks this February at the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism, as an example of the new methods the Justice Department is using to combat terrorist threats.Holder said the study will  help us develop more effective techniques and partnerships for counter-messaging.

The administration did not use the phrase  Islamist extremism  at the summit.DHS stirred controversy in 2009 when it issued a report on right-wing extremism, which included veterans returning from combat as a potential terrorist threat.The Justice Department and Michigan State University did not return requests for comment by press time.Via: Washington Free Beacon",TAXPAYER FUNDED OPERATION CONSERVATIVE TAKE DOWN : DOJ Awards MI State Univ Huge Grant To Study ‘Far Right” Groups Use Of Social Media
"Jun 1, 2016","Ironically, the two issues that catapulted Trump past all of his competitors in the GOP Presidential race were building the wall on our southern border and not allowing unveiled refugees to enter our country. We re gonna go out on a limb and guess that based on Trump s popularity with a wide variety of Americans, both issues are pretty important when it comes to our national security.Hillary Clinton will launch an attack on Donald Trump s national security policy Thursday, focusing on an issue the likely Democratic presidential nominee could use to her advantage over the billionaire New Yorker.The address in San Diego will  make clear the threat that Donald Trump would pose to our national security and to put forth her own vision for keeping America safe at home and leading in the world,  Clinton s campaign said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.For Clinton, the move is part of an effort to paint Trump as fundamentally unsuited to lead the world s most powerful military as she hopes to pivot away from the extended Democratic primary and toward a general election match-up with the presumptive GOP nominee.The attacks on Trump s lack of national security bona fides have increased speculation that he might pick a running mate with more experience in the defense or foreign policy, such as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). Throughout this campaign, Trump has refused to outline any coherent foreign policy doctrine, failed to demonstrate a basic understanding of world affairs, and repeatedly proven he s temperamentally unfit to serve as our commander in chief,  Clinton s campaign said on Wednesday.Despite his apparent weaknesses, however, Trump benefitted the most when the GOP primary contest took on a national security focus following deadly terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino last year. Notwithstanding their radical nature, Trump s proposals to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and temporarily ban foreign Muslims from entering the country have attracted a fair amount of support from fellow Republicans.",LOL!

"Jun 10, 2015","Before we explore the actual details of Marco Rubio s  extravagant purchase,  let s take a look at the brilliant tweet by Bill Sanderson, pointing out the hypocrisy of the left by comparing Marco Rubio s family home to Hillary s:https://twitter.com/mrgeology/status/608344761758568448After doing a deep dive on the Rubio s traffic violation history last week (just kidding, it wasn t a deep dive but instead information handed over by the far left American Bridge), the New York Times is back for more publishing of American Bridge material. This time, the NYT is letting everyone know just how broke the Rubio s were when they were young(er), just like everyone else in America. Oh, and that he s had trouble with his finances like every other person in America. And, he likes fun toys like any good man in America.For years, Senator Marco Rubio struggled under the weight of student debt, mortgages and an extra loan against the value of his home totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. But in 2012, financial salvation seemed to have arrived: A publisher paid him $800,000 to write a book about growing up as the son of Cuban immigrants.In speeches, Mr. Rubio, a Florida Republican, spoke of his prudent plan for using the cash to finally pay off his law school loans, expressing relief that he no longer owed  a lady named Sallie Mae,  as he once called the lender. Oh, and guess what guys? Marco Rubio had the nerve to buy a speed boat in Florida. How irresponsible. UPDATE: It was a fishing boat for his family, not an  extravagant   luxury speedboat  as the NYT claims.But at the same time, he splurged on an extravagant purchase: $80,000 for a luxury speedboat, state records show. At the time, Mr. Rubio confided to a friend that it was a potentially inadvisable outlay that he could not resist. The 24-foot boat, he said, fulfilled a dream.Here s a photo of the boat, and no, that isn t Rubio driving the boat.This is so ridiculous I m actually laughing at my computer right now. Rubio had student loan debt? Yeah, so? A lot of people do. The Rubios had trouble balancing their spending? Who doesn t? Rubio took out a loan on his home to make ends meet? Good for him, lots of people do. He was paid a hefty amount of money to write a book about his upbringing that he used to pay off debt? Even better. He had more than one home now? Cool, wish I did too. He spent $80,000 on a speed fishing boat in ocean surrounded Florida after paying off his debt? How could he?!Marco Rubio and his family are normal people chasing the American Dream and that scares the hell out of  dead broke so we could pay mortgages  Hillary Clinton supporters. The different between Rubio and Clinton is that Rubio embraces success and policies that allow every American to own multiple homes and a speed boat someday. Clinton, however, relishes in wealth instead of encouraging Americans to become wealthy themselves to live the good life. According to Clinton, not everyone can be queen.Via: Townhall",MARCO RUBIO IS CALLED IRRESPONSIBLE FOR BUYING A FISHING BOAT…Hillary Buys A Mansion In NY To Run For Senate…Crickets

Those decisions have been made by doctors and unit commanders. The new Air Force policy requires those decisions to be reviewed by high-level officials at Air Force headquarters. Though the Air Force policy regarding involuntary separation of gender dysphoric Airmen has not changed, the elevation of decision authority to the Director, Air Force Review Boards Agency, ensures the ability to consistently apply the existing policy,  Daniel Sitterly, a top Air Force personnel official, said in a statement.The Air Force and Army moves follow a number of statements from top Pentagon officials about dismantling the policy allowing transgender troops to be kicked out of the services. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said this year in response to a question about transgender service that ability to perform military tasks should be the standard for eligibility.Air Force Secretary Deborah James expressed openness to allowing transgender troops to serve.

"Jun 11, 2016","Hillary doesn t recall saying it, but Bill s campaign manager, Paul Fray clearly remembers her saying it. Just another Hillary lie what different does it make? Hillary Clinton is fighting a rearguard action to avoid further damage to her standing with the crucial Jewish vote in her campaign for a Senate seat after a claim that she once used an ethnic insult against one of Bill Clinton s aides.A book out today claims that 26 years ago she called Paul Fray, her husband s campaign manager at the time, a  fucking Jew bastard .Mrs Clinton denied the allegation and pressed the president into supporting her, but the author, Jerry Oppenheimer, said:  Three witnesses have now publicly acknowledged that she said it. I have never said anything like that, ever,  Mrs Clinton said.  I have in the past certainly, you know maybe, called somebody a name. But I have never used an ethnic, racial, anti-Semitic, bigoted, discriminatory, prejudiced, accusation against anybody. I ve never done it. I ve never thought it. Mr Clinton, who was trying to bring about a Middle East peace deal at Camp David, backed her up.  I was there on election night in 1974 and the charge is simply not true,  he said. She might have called him a bastard, I wouldn t rule that out. She s never claimed that she was pure on profanity. But I ve never heard her tell a joke with an ethnic connotation. She s so fanatic about it. It s not in her. Referring to a  vast rightwing conspiracy  in previous elections, he said:  This is part of a pattern. They couldn t defeat me politically and they can t defeat her politically so they go after us personally. Accounts of the dispute on election night 1974, when Mr Clinton failed to win a congressional seat representing Arkansas, have appeared before without the ethnic insult.Those present at the inquest into the defeat were Mr Clinton, his then-girlfriend Hillary, his campaign manager Paul Fray, and Mr Fray s wife, Mary Lee. Neill McDonald, a campaign worker, was just outside the room and claims to have heard everything.The Frays and Mr McDonald are the three witnesses on whom Mr Oppenheimer, a former reporter on the National Inquirer tabloid, relies for the passage in his book State of a Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton.Mr Fray, 57, said yesterday:  I was a little defensive about it. I looked to the floor thinking  How do I respond?  I didn t mind being called a son-of-a-bitch, but when it came to attacking my culture, that s a whole  nother ballgame.

TrumpPresident Donald Trump hailed the opening Thursday of a new coal mine as proof deregulation is helping bring jobs to the industry, even though plans for the mine s opening were made well before Trump s election.Corsa Coal Corp. will supply coal used in making steel and is expected to generate up to 100 full-time jobs. The company said it decided in August to open the Acosta mine 60 miles south of Pittsburgh after a steel industry boom drove up prices for metallurgical coal.Under a tent perched hundreds of feet above a freshly dug coal pit, about 200 miners, business leaders, and politicians celebrated amid the surge of enthusiasm for the industry. Mining headgear lay atop red, white, and blue table cloths labeled  Make Coal Great Again. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said the mine was part of an effort to bring back jobs and industry to the state. Pennsylvania awarded a $3 million grant for the project. We have not always capitalized on our standing as one of the world s leaders in these resources, but we re changing that,  Wolf said.Trump has made reversing the decades-long decline in coal mining the central tenet of his environmental policy, blaming federal regulations aimed at curbing planet-warming carbon emissions for job losses in the industry. Trump and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt have targeted laws that protected waterways from coal waste and required states to slash carbon emissions from power plants. About a dozen protesters chanted in opposition to the mine at the opening.Trump noted the impending opening of the mine last week during his speech announcing the nation s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. He said then he had hoped to attend the event; he participated via recorded video message, taking partial credit for the opening. One by one, we re eliminating the regulations that threaten your jobs, and that s one of the big reasons you re opening today: Less regulation,  Trump said.  We have withdrawn the United States from the horrendous Paris climate accord, something that would have put our country back decades and decades, we would have never allowed ourselves to be great again.

MVA is used to abort a child from 3 weeks to 12 weeks of age. This handheld syringe works by creating its own vacuum/suction. MVAs are used and reused millions of times a year around the world.

The baby swallows and breathes the poison. The cause of the death is congestion, hemorrhage and shock. The mother goes into premature labor about a day later and delivers a dead child. The other use is to inject the chemicals (digoxin, potassium chloride, etc.) into the heart of the baby. In both uses, these harsh chemicals soften the child s corpse, making it easier to rip apart and remove.489,850 babies have been aborted in the US so far this year.In 2011, 730,322 legal induced abortions were reported to CDC from 49 reporting areas.

As Secretary of State, Clinton was in charge of screening visas for admission, which some foreign nationals could then adjust to receive green cards.Following the Orlando terrorist attack, in which the son of Afghan migrants targeted the LGBT community and slaughtered 49 people in a gay nightclub, Donald Trump called for a common-sense,  mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.  Indeed, new evidence has shown that the Orlando terrorist s anti-Western values were imported from overseas   and were not  homegrown  or native to the United States absent immigration.Trump explained that the values of radical Islam   which our current immigration policies are importing into America   are  incompatible with Western values and institutions :A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation. It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation  Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions. Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American. I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.Trump pledged that, as President, he would curb the flow of assimilation-resistant migrants from terror-prone regions that  share these same oppressive views. Following the attack, the Washington Post published a list of mostly Muslim countries where homosexuality may be punished by death. The Washington Post, however, did not deem it necessary to make any mention of how many migrants from these nations that hold anti-Western, anti-LGBT values are being resettled throughout the United States.Between 2001 and 2014, the U.S. permanently resettled 674,920 migrants from nations where gays can be executed, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).This figure does not include the total number of migrants the U.S. has permanently resettled from Muslim nations during that time, which is nearly 1.7 million.To see the breakdown of how many migrants the U.S. has admitted from countries where homosexuality can be punishable by death, click HERE.Many Washington politicians, however, have pushed to continue   and even expand-   the already record high levels of immigration from nations that hold anti-Western values.Hillary Clinton is joined in her opposition to pausing Muslim migration by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who today said that temporarily pausing Muslim migration is  not reflective of our principles  and is not  in our country s best interest. In stating his opposition to Trump s proposal, Ryan did not explain how American communities have been made better by such historic flows of Sharia-sympathetic migrants or   as Donald Trump put it    why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.

"Jun 15, 2015","George, Barack and Hillary the axis of evil Professional race activists Deray McKesson and Johnetta Elzie (ShordeeDooWhop), pictured here in Baltimore, helped whip up the Ferguson mobs. This year Fortune Magazine named these two professional activists two of the world s greatest leaders.Many conservatives rightly smelled a rat in the supposed organic race-riot movement that sprang up so quickly in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014 after the shooting death of robber Michael Brown. After burning the Ferguson and Dellwood, Missouri business districts to the ground the radical left has relentlessly sought to recreate the same discord and disinformation in various locations around the U.S. Ferguson #BlackLivesMatter protest leaders have been flown to New York, South Carolina, Milwaukee, Selma, and more recently to McKinney, Texas and Hillary s campaign relaunch in New York.Thankfully, every day patriots and online conservative investigators still fight to shine truth, anywhere  the movement  tries to sow its twisted seeds to foment anger, feed bitterness, and breed division.Much has been printed about the paid protesters and Soros connections.** Nearly half of the roughly 500 businesses operating in Ferguson and adjacent communities, such as Dellwood and Jennings, suffered property damage or lost revenue as a result of the coordinated Ferguson protests and riots.In May black Ferguson activists staged a protest at the office of MORE (Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment) to complain that the group s white leaders collected tens of thousands of dollars in donations off of the Black Lives Matter movement without paying the Black participants their fair share. It was during these protests that Ferguson activists admitted that fellow protesters were making MORE THAN $5,000 a month to disrupt cities, damage property and attack police!In response to these protests MORE released a list of names and amounts paid out to protesters and protest groups who agitated and harassed police night-after-night in Ferguson last fall and winter.The list of over 80 groups and individuals was posted on Twitter by an irate protester. Via Weasel ZippersOne of the protest leaders who showed up in Ferguson shortly after Michael Brown s death was DeRay McKesson from Minneapolis. DeRay and fellow activist Johnetta Elzie (ShordeeDooWhop) were nationally recognized and celebrated by the liberal media as two of the top stars of the violent protest mob.We now know that DeRay McKesson has been working with and for Soros-funded groups since he was in junior high school. We know this because DeRay released his resume online this past weekend.DeRay says he s been living off of savings for the past nine months as he s turned up in Ferguson, Baltimore, New York City, Milwaukee, Selma, McKinney and this past weekend he was at Hillary Clinton s campaign relaunch in New York state.DeRay and Charles Wade, Solange Knowles s stylist, the founder of Op Help or Hush have known each other for three years. Wade and McKesson were regular Ferguson protesters. That means the two have been affiliated well before Michael Brown went on his crime spree. DeRay has used his capacity, as Charles calls it, to push  the movement s  agenda far and wide.DeRay has long been known for his skill at  community organizing .He served as president of his class at Bowdoin College, as well as president of Bowdoin Student Government. While at Bowdoin, DeRay reportedly grew close to Bowdoin President Barry Mills, whose wife, Karen Gordon Mills, served in the Obama Administration. DeRay just happened to stay on the couch of an unnamed Bowdoin alum when he first descended on Ferguson.After graduating from Bowdoin, DeRay worked for the Harlem Children s Zone, run by none other than Bowdoin alums Druckenmiller and Geoffrey Canada. Coincidentally, Geoffrey served on the Open Society Institute s board.Throwback, meeting HCZ's Geoff Canada. pic.twitter.com/ocyw6Yo57q  deray mckesson (@deray) February 16, 2015DeRay also worked for  the movement  linked Teach For America, another radical Soros-funded group.But DeRay s ties to Soros and  community organizing  seemingly date back even further, to McKesson s teen years, at least. Suffice it to say, DeRay has been tied to Soros for more than a decade, through many programs.Perhaps DeRay s long and numerous apparent ties to Soros explain how he was so quickly dispatched to Ferguson, Missouri to take control of the protesters and become the powerfuls  approved and promoted voice on the ground. As DeRay said,  People will come out into the streets to confront a system that is corrupt.  Yet, DeRay seems to be molded, directed, and funded by some of the most powerful men in that very  system.  It looks as if someone may be pulling the strings behind the scenes to foment rage as this astroturf anti-police movement spreads from Ferguson to other points in America.Via: Gateway PunditAND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST...Here s Deray throwing his support behind Hillary on Twitter!

"Jun 16, 2015","If the murderer was arguing in defense of a Republican would the media be working so hard to keep her political persuasion private?  In a dramatic and colorful case with strong political overtones, a Livonia, Michigan woman was ordered to stand trial for murder after allegedly bashing her neighbor to death with a slow cooker following an argument over presidential politics. The news media are studiously avoiding any inquiry into the politics of the accused and those of the victim, which ordinarily tells you the story. A few seconds  worth of internet sleuthing fills in a few details that proceed along the lines any conservative (but no media reporter) would suspect.// <![CDATA[ var p = new anv_pl_def();p.loadVideoWithKey(""eyJwIjoiMTAwMDAxMSIsIm0iOiJTUFMiLCJ2IjoiZXhwcmVzc18xNDM0NDkzMDY2MDA2In0=""); // ]]>https://youtu.be/MxaEuvmBuo4The Detroit News reports:A Detroit woman was ordered Thursday to stand trial in the killing of her friend beaten with a slow cooker after the two argued about politics.Tewana Sullivan, 50, who is charged with murder, cried at her preliminary hearing as she heard graphic details about the fatal Oct. 22 assault on Cheryl Livy, 66, with a kitchen appliance.Oakland County Medical Examiner Dr. Ljubisa Dragovic testified before Livonia District Judge Sean Kavanagh that Livy died of blunt force injuries to her head, face and mid-back.Livy also had defensive injuries to the back of her hands where it appears she tried to protect herself, Dragovic testified.Livy was discovered barely breathing with the cord of the  busted  slow cooker around her neck in her apartment around 10:45 p.m. at the McNamara Towers senior housing complex in the 19300 block of Purlingbrook, officer Thomas Blauvelt testified.Blauvelt said he found  blood all over the walls, all over the floor, all over the victim. In other words, an extremely brutal murder. Not quite ISIS-level, but no swords, cages, or lighter fluid were at hand. Using what was available, a slow cooker (apparently this was a kitchen discussion), Ms. Livy was beaten to death, as she futilely tried to defend herself.The argument was over politics, but no specifics are being given:Defense attorney John McWilliams said the two women had argued over  presidential politics. Whatever the controversy is between Democrats and Republicans,  he said.As a conservative, I am accustomed to vitriol being hurled at me from the left. Sure, there are some uncouth and some violent people on the right, but in this era, one sees racial agitators on the left in particular sparking violent attacks, as, for example, following the shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. I am not aware of any riots in the past several decades by conservatives.The defendant, Ms. Sullivan, is black. We know that roughly 92% of blacks voted for President Obama. The victim, Ms. Livy, is white. Take a look at the Facebook page Justice for Cheryl Livy to see her pictures: This is not conclusive evidence, to be sure. It is possible Ms. Livy was an extreme leftist. arguing with Ms. Sullivan that Obama is not progressive enough. Or maybe Ms. Sullivan was among the small minority of blacks who are conservative, though I have never in my life heard of a black conservative who has tendencies toward violence (Clarence Thomas, Thomas Sowell, Lloyd Marcus, Kevin Jackson   they all tend toward thoughtful). But the odds are that a Democrat assassinated a critic of President Obama ( presidential politics  today necessarily involve President Obama) in the wake of a heated political argument. I d be willing to bet a substantial amount of money on that with anyone who would give me even odds.Via: American Thinker",[VIDEO] DETROIT WOMAN KILLS BEST FRIEND OVER 2012 PRESIDENTIAL RACE ARGUMENT…Media Refuses To Say Killer Supported Obama

In 1926 he was made Gauleiter, or party leader, for the region of Berlin, and in 1927 he founded and became editor of the official National Socialist periodical Der Angriff (The Attack). He was elected to the Reichstag, the German parliament, in 1928. By exploiting mob emotions and by employing all modern methods of propaganda Goebbels helped Hitler into power. His work as a propagandist materially aided Hitler s rise to power in 1933. When Hitler seized power in 1933, Goebbels was appointed Reichsminister for propaganda and national enlightenment. From then until his death, Goebbels used all media of education and communications to further Nazi propagandistic aims, instilling in the Germans the concept of their leader as a veritable god and of their destiny as the rulers of the world. In 1938 he became a member of the Hitler cabinet council. Late in World War II, in 1944, Hitler placed him in charge of total mobilization. As Reichsminister for Propaganda and National Enlightenment, Goebbels was given complete control over radio, press, cinema, and theater; later he also regimented all German culture. Goebbels placed his undeniable intelligence and his brilliant insight into mass psychology entirely at the service of his party. His most virulent propaganda was against the Jews. As a hypnotic orator he was second only to Hitler, and in his staging of mass meetings and parades he was unsurpassed. Utterly cynical, he seems to have believed only in the self-justification of power. He remained loyal to Hitler until the end. On May 1, 1945, as Soviet troops were storming Berlin, Goebbels committed suicide.Via: whale",PROTESTER Rushes Stage at NYC Play Showing Assassination of President Trump: “You have the blood of Steve Scalise on your hands!”[Video]

"Jun 18, 2015","Just when you thought the 2014 election results would provide America with some checks and balances U.S. lawmakers narrowly approved legislation key to securing a hallmark Pacific trade deal on Thursday, partly reversing a defeat less than a week before, in a boost to President Barack Obama s goal of strengthening U.S. economic ties with Asia.The House of Representatives voted 218 to 208 to give the White House authority to close trade deals such as the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which encompasses 40 percent of the global economy and is close to completion.But the bill, a stripped-down version of legislation which failed at a vote last week, must now go back to the Senate for approval, where a vote is likely next week.The House has been wrestling for weeks with fast-track authority, which lets lawmakers set negotiating objectives for trade deals, such as the TPP, but restricts them to a yes-or-no vote on the finished agreement.Democrats last week dramatically rejected a personal appeal from Obama to back legislation central to his hallmark Pacific Rim trade deal by voting down a companion measure to renew an expiring program to help workers hurt by trade.The trade package consists of three basic components.That measure was cut from the bill approved on Thursday, but the change from the original legislation ensures a return to the Senate, delaying final passage further.In debate before the vote, many Democrats lined up on the House floor to voice their anger with Obama s trade initiative. This thing is modeled after NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), which cost us 5 million jobs,  said veteran Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter.RELATED COVERAGE House speaker: Confident in  pretty good place  on trade vote Republicans, weary of the long struggle to pass fast-track, urged the House to vote and move on.  Enacting trade promotion authority is critical for our economy and for our national security, and so we re going to get it done here today,  Ways and Means Committee chairman Paul Ryan, a Republican, said.CLOCK TICKINGDemocratic Senator Ron Wyden told Reuters pro-trade Democrats were determined to pass both fast-track and the worker aid program and were working on a plan to achieve that goal.House Speaker John Boehner said he hoped the Senate would soon take up fast-track and the worker aid program, which would be tacked on to a bill renewing trade benefits for African countries.But members of the Congressional Black Caucus have warned against using the bill as a  bargaining chip  and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who voted against fast-track, said she did not see a path forward for the worker aid program.Many Democrats, who have strong links to trade unions, fear trade deals such as the TPP will cost U.S. jobs as employers chase lower costs in signatory countries.The House vote is a good sign for the TPP, which would harmonize standards on issues like intellectual property and labor protections and lower trade barriers among the dozen emerging and developed countries.Approval of the TPP would open new markets for major U.S. exporters such as Boeing (BA.N), Ford (F.N), IBM (IBM.N), Caterpillar (CAT.N), Merck (MRK.N) and Cisco (CSCO.O), policy analysts said.Negotiators are under pressure to finish the pact, which is already more than five years in the making, to allow the TPP to clear Congress before 2016 U.S. presidential election campaigns dominate the agenda.Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has yet to take a stand on the deal, but the former secretary of state has said Obama should take on board legitimate concerns expressed by fellow Democrats.Some TPP partner countries, including Japan and Canada, want fast track in place before making final offers on the trade deal, which economists estimate would boost the global economy by almost $300 billion a year.Trade deals are controversial in the United States, which has a share of exports to gross domestic product roughly half that of China, partly because of the country s past experience with NAFTA.That pact freed up trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico and, more than two decades later, is blamed by many for U.S. factory closures and job losses and has soured sentiment toward the TPP.",BREAKING: Republican Majority House Caves To Obama…Narrowly Passes TPA Bill

From then until his death, Goebbels used all media of education and communications to further Nazi propagandistic aims, instilling in the Germans the concept of their leader as a veritable god and of their destiny as the rulers of the world. In 1938 he became a member of the Hitler cabinet council. Late in World War II, in 1944, Hitler placed him in charge of total mobilization. As Reichsminister for Propaganda and National Enlightenment, Goebbels was given complete control over radio, press, cinema, and theater; later he also regimented all German culture. Goebbels placed his undeniable intelligence and his brilliant insight into mass psychology entirely at the service of his party. His most virulent propaganda was against the Jews. As a hypnotic orator he was second only to Hitler, and in his staging of mass meetings and parades he was unsurpassed. Utterly cynical, he seems to have believed only in the self-justification of power. He remained loyal to Hitler until the end. On May 1, 1945, as Soviet troops were storming Berlin, Goebbels committed suicide.Via: whale",BREAKING: WATCH TWO PROTESTERS Crash ‘Trump Assassination’ Play in NYC: “Liberal Hate Kills!” [Video]
"Jun 19, 2015","This video shows what happens when a large population of muslim immigrants refuse to assimilate with the culture of residents living in the country where they have immigrated. Instead, muslims in Britain and in countries all over the world are demanding the citizens who have been living there for centuries conform to their extreme radical religious views. In May, new census data published by the British government showed that Islam is set to become the dominant religion in Britain within the next generation.On being informed that the girl did not want to get married, Mohammed Shahid Akhtar, Imam of Birmingham s Central Jamia Masjid Ghamkol Sharif Mosque, said,  She s 14. By Sharia, grace of Allah, she s legal to get married. The Muslim population of Britain topped 3.3 million by the end of 2013 to become around 5.2% of the overall population of 63 million, according to figures extrapolated from a recent study on the growth of the Muslim population in Europe.At the same time, opinion surveys consistently show that voters in Britain view Islam and the question of Muslim immigration as a top-ranked public concern. The British public, it seems, is increasingly worried about the establishment of a parallel Muslim society there.But government efforts to push back against the Islamization of Britain have been halting and half-hearted.What follows is a chronological review of some of the main stories involving the rise of Islam in Britain during 2013.In January, Muslim gangs were filmed loitering on streets in London and demanding that passersby conform to Islamic Sharia law. In a series of videos, the self-proclaimed vigilantes who call themselves Muslim London Patrol are seen abusing non-Muslim pedestrians and repeatedly shouting  this is a Muslim area. One video records the men shouting:  Allah is the greatest! Islam is here, whether you like it or not. We are here! We are here! What we need is Islam! What we need is Sharia! The video continues:  We are the Muslim Patrol. We are in north London, we are in south London, in east London and west London. We command good and forbid evil. Islam is here in London. [Prime Minister] David Cameron, Mr. Police Officer, whether you like it or not, we will command good and forbid evil. You will never get us. You can go to hell! This is not a Christian country. To hell with Christianity. Isa [Jesus] was a messenger of Allah. Muslim Patrol will never die. Allah is great! Allah is great! We are coming! In a January 23 interview with the online newspaper International Business Times, Anjem Choudary, a radical preacher who has long called for Sharia law to be implemented in Britain and other European countries, defended the gang, saying:  This is a wake-up call for society to ask,  where are we headed?  There is a clash between Islam and liberal democracy in hotspot areas of London. Choudary has previously led a campaign, known as the Islamic Emirates Project, to turn twelve British cities including what he calls  Londonistan into independent Islamic states. The so-called Islamic Emirates would function as autonomous enclaves, ruled by Sharia law and governed entirely outside British jurisprudence.In February, Choudary was filmed urging his followers to quit their jobs and claim unemployment benefits so they have more time to plan holy war against non-Muslims.Excerpts of the speech, published by the London-based newspaper The Sun on February 17, drew renewed attention to the growing problem of Muslims in Britain and elsewhere who are exploiting European welfare systems.In the video, Choudary is recorded as saying that Muslims are justified in taking money from non-Muslims, whom he mocks for working in nine-to-five jobs their whole lives. He says:  You find people are busy working the whole of their life. They wake up at 7 o clock. They go to work at 9 o clock. They work for eight, nine hours a day. They come home at 7 o clock, watch EastEnders [a British soap opera], sleep, and they do that for 40 years of their life. That is called slavery. . . . What kind of life is that? That is the life of the kuffar [a non-Muslim]. Choudary urges fellow Muslims to learn from revered figures in Islamic history who only worked one or two days a year.  The rest of the year they were busy with jihad [holy war] and things like that,  he says.  People will say,  Ah, but you are not working.  But the normal situation is for you to take money from the kuffar. So we take Jihad Seeker s Allowance. In March, the London-based newspaper The Independent reported that at least 100 British Muslims are currently active as jihadists fighting in Syria, which has replaced Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia as the main destination for militant Islamists seeking to obtain immediate combat experience with little or no official scrutiny.Also in March, St. John s Episcopal Church in Aberdeen, Scotland, became the first church in the United Kingdom to share its premises with Muslim worshippers. Church officials now welcome hundreds of Muslims praying five times a day in their building because the nearby mosque is filled to overcapacity and Muslim worshippers are forced to pray outside.

"Jun 19, 2016","Oh look Hillary s considering a lying, opportunist, Democrat politician with a vagina as her running mate. It all makes perfect sense if you consider that Hillary s thinking ahead, and that if anything happened to her she wants to make sure she has someone with the same morals and ethics to fill her corrupt shoes In Warren s book  A Fighting Chance,  Massachusetts Democratic senator and potential vice presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren attempts to rewrite history regarding the controversy surrounding her  Native American  ancestry that emerged in the 2012 Senate campaign. What s remarkable is that, at least in the initial book reviews, the press largely allows her to get away with it. In fact, it s virtually ignored that to this day Warren still refuses to release any law school records that may shed light on this controversy.To be fair, most reviews note that Warren has never substantiated her claims of Native American heritage, which is true. The larger and unaddressed issue, however, is whether or not Warren falsely claimed minority status in order to gain an unfair advantage in her academic career. This was a question that was unresolved at the end of the 2012 campaign and it remains unresolved with the publication of Warren s book.Watch Cherokee people from ND tell how they feel about Lying Elizabeth using phony  Native American  status to gain an advantage in obtaining a job:First, what s perhaps most notable about Warren s book is that she even includes a section called  Native American,  in which she reportedly writes,  Everyone on our mother s side   aunts, uncles, and grandparents   talked openly about their Native American ancestry. My brothers and I grew up on stories about our grandfather building one-room schoolhouses and about our grandparents  courtship and their early lives together in Indian Territory. This is ironic because, until the Boston Herald first broke the news in April 2012 that Harvard Law School had repeatedly promoted Warren as a Native American faculty member, Warren never once mentioned these stories of her upbringing in a single press interview, speech, class lecture or testimony at any point, ever, in her decades-long career. What s more, Warren was not listed as a minority on her transcript from George Washington University where she began her undergraduate education, nor did she list herself as a minority when applying to Rutgers University Law School in 1973.In fact, it was not until she was in her 30s and focused on climbing the highly competitive ladder of law school academia that Warren apparently rediscovered her Native American heritage. It s important to note that entrance and advancement in the law school profession is governed by the Association of American Law Schools, which requires registrants interested in teaching at law schools to fill out a questionnaire detailing their education, experience, bar passage and, yes, ethnicity. This information is then disseminated to law schools around the country that, as Warren surely knew, are always on the lookout to add to the diversity of their faculty.A copy of Warren s questionnaire currently resides in the Association of American Law Schools archives at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. However, only Warren herself has the authority to release the complete copy of her questionnaire and to date, she has refused to do so.Watch Warren stonewalling the press over her phony  Native American  status and double down on her refusal to clear the record and release the copy of her questionnaire: Her opposition to such transparency can perhaps be understood in the documented fact that in the years thereafter, starting in 1986, Warren began self-reporting herself as a  minority professor  in the Association of American Law Schools staff directory that lists all law school professors around the country. As the former association chairman told the Boston Herald, the directory once served a tip sheet for law school administrators, in the pre-Internet days, who were looking to identify and recruit minority professors.Remarkably, Warren s explanation to the Boston Herald was that she listed herself as a minority in the hopes that she would be invited to a luncheon so she could meet  people who are like I am  and she stopped checking the box when that didn t happen. Perhaps it  didn t happen  because at no point, at any of the schools she attended or worked at, is there any evidence that Warren ever joined any Native American organizations on campus or in any way interacted with anyone in the Native American community.That did not however, stop Warren from continuing to self-report as a Native American minority. The New York Times reported in May 2012 that Warren was listed as a minority recipient of a teaching award years earlier at the University of Pennsylvania where she had advanced after teaching at several non-Ivy League law schools. Notably, Penn declined to explain to the Times why Warren was listed as a minority.From Penn, Warren moved on to Harvard Law School, where her Native American heritage was touted in multiple articles, including a Fordham Law Review piece that lauded her as Harvard Law s   first woman of color.  Even as recently as 2011, it appears Warren was listed as the lone Native American faculty member on the school s 2011  diversity report,  though like Penn, Harvard also refused to comment.Yet, when the Herald first broke the story in April 2012, Warren claimed she  had no idea  that Harvard had touted her Native American status and claimed she did not  recall  ever citing her Native American heritage when applying for a job. In the months afterward, Warren ducked, dodged and stonewalled subsequent questions, eventually wearing-out the press, and succeeded in winning an election without ever releasing any records that might substantiate those claims.Whether Warren falsely claimed to be a minority in order to game the system and advance her career is a question that goes to the heart of her honesty and integrity. It s also a question that will confront her if she ever seeks higher office.

"Jun 2, 2015","But what about Hillary being a  formidable opponent  when it comes to women voters? Hillary Clinton had trouble attracting high-powered women to a New York talk hosted by Silda Wall Spitzer two weeks before her campaign officially kicks off. Sources said that after ticket sales fizzled for an intimate, $2,700-per-person,  just for women  meeting on Monday, the event was thrown open to men at the 11th hour, and the deadline extended to buy tickets.The  Conversation With Hillary Clinton  event at Midtown law firm Akin Gump was originally aiming to attract 125 women. An email invitation seen by Page Six said the event is  just for women.  But by Friday,  They d only sold 50 tickets, so they threw it open to men,  a source said.  Ticket sales were supposed to close at 10 a.m. Sunday, but the hostesses were working the phones and pushed the deadline till Monday. We hear about 90 attendees included former Bill Clinton aide Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney and his husband, Randy Florke, Maurice Tempelsman, Jill Braufman (wife of hedge funder Daniel Nir), Jean Shafiroff and Susan Cole. The event began at noon, but Clinton arrived at 1 p.m. in  a royal blue jacket and black pants.  She then took pictures with donors and delivered a half-hour speech before leaving at about 2 p.m.Silda introduced Clinton as a  tough, authentic leader,  which is probably more than she can say about her hard-charging ex Eliot. In a possible nod to her host, Clinton quoted Eleanor Roosevelt, quipping,  Every woman in public life needs to develop skin as tough as rhinoceros hide. Topics included  clean energy,  mental health care for college kids, keeping but  revising  ObamaCare, Vladimir Putin, and America s heroin and meth  epidemic. Meanwhile, on Monday, journalists covering Clinton met in Washington, DC, to grouse about inadequate access to the candidate.

"Jun 20, 2015","The EPA continues to push for more and more restrictions on emissions. The Obama agenda continues and is bolstered by the Pope s call for action on the global warming scam. Anyone with half a brain can see through this political agenda and knows it has nothing to do with any truth about climate. Crazy times!The Obama administration on Friday proposed tougher mileage standards for medium and heavy-duty trucks, the latest move by President Barack Obama in his second-term drive to reduce pollution blamed for global warming.The Environmental Protection Agency issued new rules that would lower carbon dioxide emissions from trucks and vans by 24 percent by 2027. It would cut fuel costs by about $170 billion and reduce oil consumption by up to 1.8 billion barrels over the lifetime of vehicles sold under the rule.The long-expected rules come one day after Pope Francis issued a teaching document calling for the world to take action to slow climate change.Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement that the new rules would help the environment and the economy, as trucks use less fuel and shipping costs go down. He called the rules  good news all around. Gina McCarthy, chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the rules would deliver  big time  on Obama s call to cut carbon pollution. With emission reductions weighing in at 1 billion tons, this proposal will save consumers, businesses and truck owners money,  McCarthy said. At the same time, the rules will  spur technology innovation and job-growth, while protecting Americans  health and our environment over the long haul,  she said.Read more: Sioux City Journal",OBAMA’S EPA PUSHES FOR TOUGHER MILEAGE STANDARDS FOR TRUCKS

Hillary s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?Dolly Kyle   who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated   published the claims about the Clinton couple s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.Bill and Hillary Clinton profess to have always been supporters of racial equality, but anecdotes published in a new book by his ex-lover claim otherwise.Bill was also sued several times by blacks and Hispanics for violations of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.Behind the Reverend Jesse Jackson s back, the Clinton duo called him,  That G**damned n****r .Dolly claims the couple used the same insult toward Robert  Say  McIntosh, one of the leading African-American activists in Little Rock, Arkansas when Bill was governor. McIntosh was dogging Clinton about ongoing relationships with black prostitutes, q charge, she says, Bill never denied.Clinton never denied stories that he was having an ongoing relationship with one black prostitute as well as her friends. He did deny a rumor that he had fathered a child with a black prostitute while governor and took a DNA test that was reported as negative.Rumors of the trysts throughout Little Rock and were aided by  one prominent black female newscaster who used to brag openly around the television station about her relationship with the governor, although they were  only  indulging in oral sex .Bill Clinton and Dolly grew up with Jim Crow laws in place in the plantation mentality of the South and they were in full force during the 1950s and  60s.It was a segregated society in Hot Springs at that time. Black and white students went to different schools. In the movie theaters, black people had to watch the movie from a balcony, use separate bathrooms and water fountains. Signs that separated  WHITES  and  COLORED  were deadly serious and always enforced , Dolly writes.In Arkansas, everyone had to pay a $2 poll tax to vote, and the cost was a huge sum for many black people.The black vote was further diluted by  gerrymandering, a wide-spread practice of dividing electoral districts along racial lines to dilute the black vote .Not one black was voted into the Arkansas legislation in hundreds of elections.In the 1980s, Clinton was sued several times by blacks and Hispanics for violations of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and he lost every case.The district lines were redrawn under court order.Ben McGee was a black Democrat was elected to the state legislature in 1988. Clinton tried to replace McGee with a white Democrat of his choice, claims Dolly.The case went all the way to the Supreme Court was ruled 8-0 against Clinton and the Arkansas officials who challenged McGee s election.In the 1980s, Hispanics were moving into Arkansas in greater numbers and Clinton began racial profiling against Hispanics, she claims.He instituted the racial profiling program three years after his brother, Roger Clinton went to prison in 1985 for dealing cocaine. The program was initially part of his anti-drug program, although Roger s drug suppliers and buyers were white. For no good reason, Bill and Hillary decided to profile Hispanics as drug dealers,  Dolly writes.State troopers now had the authority to stop and search any vehicle remotely suspect of carrying drugs. Specifically, the troopers were to stop and search cars driven by Hispanics, especially those cars with Texas license plates. Clinton was sued in federal court for his Criminal Apprehension Program that was ruled unconstitutional. Billy threw one of his infamous temper tantrums about the ban on his racial profiling of Hispanics and he threatened to renew the racial profiling program in spite of the court s ruling , Dolly reports.

"Jun 20, 2017","Please please please let it be a 3-way race between Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Eric Holder!Former Attorney General Eric Holder spoke in Los Angeles on Monday to promote a bill that some observers say would make California a  sanctuary state,  an appearance that he says is the start of a new phase of his career in which he plans to reenter the world of politics. Up to now, I have been more behind-the-scenes,  Holder told Yahoo News in a new interview published Tuesday, describing his plans.  But that s about to change. Holder, who served as former President Barack Obama s first attorney general, indicated that his goal is to head the legal resistance to President Donald Trump s agenda. But that may just be the tip of the iceberg.Three sources who have spoken to Holder and are familiar with his thinking told Yahoo that he may consider challenging Trump in 2020 for the White House. Now is the time to be more visible,  Holder said.  Now is the time to be heard. I have a certain status as the former attorney general. A certain familiarity as the first African-American attorney general. There s a justified perception that I m close to President Obama,  Holder added.  So I want to use whatever skills I have, whatever notoriety I have, to be effective in opposing things that are, at the end of the day, just bad for the country. Holder was getting paid $25,000 per month to serve as outside counsel to the heavily-Democratic California state legislature to counter the Trump administration. The legislation he supported Monday would prevent state police from helping to enforce immigration law, and Holder traveled across the country to promote it.  WFBEric Holder was one of the most controversial AG s in the history of the United States. He spent most of his first term under investigation while serving as Obama s Attorney General. He was the key figure in the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal with Mexico, and in 2012 Congress voted to hold him in contempt for not turning over documents on the Fast and Furious  gun-walking  scandal. He was also involved in the IRS scandal that targeted conservatives and conservative leaning organizations.Holder also was instrumental in fanning the flames of the Trayvon Martin case in Sanford, Florida. While he was acting as our nation s Attorney General, he was caught by Judicial Watch spending our taxpayer dollars to deploy a little-known unit of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Community Relations Service (CRS)  to Sanford, FL, following the Trayvon Martin shooting to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman.

"Jun 22, 2015","America deserves so much better and should get early serious about our next president. Obama has been so undignified throughout his presidency and unserious on so many occasions. We don t need a nice guy or a funny guy for our next president. We need a serious man who is selfless in his desire to put America back on track. I couldn t think of a better way to spell it out than this awesome piece from White House Dossier that says what we ve all been thinking. I know I m 100% FED Up! with a president who s a partier and NOT a PATRIOT.I wonder what would happen if nine people were murdered in a church and a Republican president jetted out to the West Coast for four days of fundraising and golf. Surely, the sensitivity police would have been brought out in force and locked down the nation s airwaves, commenting on the callousness of the president and the Neanderthal nature of Republicans in general.But Obama returned Sunday night from four fundraisers and two rounds of golf without hearing a peep of protest, his devotion to government having pre-certified him as a caring, sensitive type and rendered him immune to suggestions otherwise.But the parties, the constant golf, the extravagant and frequent vacationing do take a toll. Because Obama does not understand that his presidency, like any other, is within a kind of petrie dish, and every seemingly insignificant mold that grows there is scrutinized by friends and enemies alike.If Obama wonders why nobody in Congress cares what he thinks, why Iran doubles down on its insults as nuclear deal time approaches, or why the Chinese blithely arise strategically placed islands out of depths of the South China Sea, well part of the answer is the unseriousness with which everyone can see this president operates.Obama, who the previous weekend had staged a  what the heck  party for 500 people to celebrate no particular occasion and who, during his California trip, offered a rare interview to a podcast titled  WTF,  has stripped the presidency of what was left of its dignity in the aftermath the fun-loving Democratic president who preceded him.I was reminded of how the actions of a president can echo in unpredictable directions and with unanticipated force when I read last week about an interview former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren did with the Times of Israel. Oren said:The bottom line is that the day that Obama didn t act against the Syrians (for their use of chemical weapons in 2013, and thus failed) to maintain the Syrian  red line,  was the day that the debate (over whether Obama was serious about his military option on Iran) stopped here. Did you notice that? Just stopped. Dead. And everyone went quiet. An eerie quiet. Everyone understood at that point that that was not an option, that we re on our own.Obama didn t understand that when he, as president   as opposed to community organizer   drew a  red line,  it meant something. And when he didn t enforce, it meant something even greater.I recalled then the story about how Ronald Reagan s decision in 1981 to fire most of the illegally striking air traffic controllers reverberated far beyond our bordersWrites Peggy Noonan, Reagan s biographer and former speechwriter.Foreign governments, from friends and allies to adversaries and competitors, saw that the new president could make tough decisions, pay the price, and win the battle. The Soviets watched like everybody else. They observed how the new president handled a national-security challenge. They saw that his rhetorical toughness would be echoed in tough actions. They hadn t known that until this point. They knew it now.This is why Reagan s secretary of state George Shultz said that the Patco decision was the most important foreign-policy decision Reagan ever made.Everyone knew at the time that it was a domestic crisis. It wasn t until years later that they came to appreciate that it was foreign-affairs victory.People understood this new president was not to be messed with. Just as people understand they can mess with the current one all they like.Read more: White House Dossier",A PRESIDENT WHO’S UNSERIOUS AND UNDIGNIFIED…DON’T WE DESERVE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS?!

"Jun 23, 2015","One more Republican doing his part to aid Obama in his fundamental transformation of America Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) cast the deciding vote for Obamatrade on Tuesday as it squeeked through the U.S. Senate 60-37, and his Senate office is still outright refusing to answer whether he even knew what he was voting on.Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, was the deciding vote necessary for the U.S. Senate to clear the final 60-vote threshold and eventually, later this week, send to President Barack Obama s desk the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) bill that would fast-track at least three highly secretive trade deals that Obama has been negotiating for years.TPA will, now that it s going to pass, effectively ensure the congressional approval of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). The text of the TiSA and T-TIP agreements is currently entirely secretive, even to lawmakers on Capitol Hill and their staffs, though WikiLeaks did uncover several TiSA documents that leaked and prove the deal would surrender congressional power over U.S. immigration policy to the executive branch and perhaps to a newly created transnational entity.The TPP text for the Pacific Rim trade deal that Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL)80% notes would give the Sultan of Brunei who has implemented Sharia Law in his nation and banned Christmas, literally an  equal vote to that of the United States,  on the other hand, is available for members of Congress to read. The only catch is they have to go to a secret room inside the Capitol basement for classified readings to read it in person, they can t take notes, and only their staffers with enough high enough security clearances can go with them to read it and their staff can t go without them.Before the Senate voted on TPA to fast track these deals the first time back in May, Breitbart News asked every Senate Republican if they read the text of the TPP before voting to fast-track it. Only a handful said they did.Sens. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)93% , Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)93% , Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL)80% , Sen. James Lankford (R-OK)60% and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT)100% went to go read it. Rubio, on the other hand, was one of many who has consistently and repeatedly refused to answer whether he read the deal text. His office refuse to answer yet again on Tuesday whether he went to go read it before the first time he voted for TPA or before the second time he did on Tuesday s cloture vote and that means he s again choosing to give the public impression he did not read the text of the deal before he voted to fast track it through Congress.This could have significant implications for Rubio on the campaign trail as he seeks the Republican nomination for the presidency as activists in early states are furious with his decision to support Obamatrade when it s clear he doesn t know what he s talking about.New Hampshire conservative and Merrimack Councilman Bill Boyd, who s endorsed Paul for president, told Breitbart News while on a recent reporting trip to New Hampshire that he s upset that Rubio didn t read the deal before he voted to fast-track it. He s been the biggest advocate against Obamacare and the ACA, and for all the time Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)9% kept on saying  we have to pass this bill to find out what s in it,  Boyd said.You re telling me Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)80% voted for a bill without reading it? Are you kidding? You know what, we elect people to go down there to represent us. At a bare minimum you have staff. Staff should be providing some kind of an executive summary. If it s a thousand pages, you should be cutting it up and giving it to staff and get 10 or 20 page synopses. If your staff can t bring a particular issue on in a two page memo than they have no idea what they re talking about. For Sen. Rubio to admit that, that s kind of surprising. That s kind of surprising not to read a document and make an opinion without even looking at it. You need to be able to formulate an opinion. If somebody gives you the cliff notes version of a bill, that s at least better than not reading it at all. So that s kind of surprising.

"Jun 25, 2016","No evidence No worries Obama s got this one. Meanwhile, the Democrat Party s presidential nominee would already be in jail if King Obama wasn t stalling the investigation In case you needed more evidence that Obama s Justice Department is more interested in proving white people are racists than actually fighting crime, here it is: The FBI is offering a huge reward for anyone that can help them frame a white police officer who killed an armed black criminal in a completely justified shooting.Last week, a white Mobile, AL police officer shot and killed Michael Moore during a traffic stop. I know what you are thinking, no, not fat white liberal gasbag Michael Moore, this was black criminal Michael Moore.On June 13th, Officer Harold Hurst with the Mobile PD was on his way to work when he observed a white Lexus make a dangerous left turn into traffic, almost causing an accident. The officer pulled the vehicle over that was being driven by Michael Moore, with two additional passengers. The ID Moore gave was fake and the car was stolen.Officer Hurst called for back up and asked Moore to step out of the car. The officer observed a .40 caliber handgun in Moore s waistband and ordered him to put his hands up. Instead, Moore reached for the gun so Hurst had no choice but to shoot. On the ground, Moore was still trying to get to the gun in his pants and the officer fired another round. Moore was taken to the hospital where he died.Police recovered a gun from Moore s body and one of the passengers in the car confirmed that he had a gun on him at the time of the shooting. This is as cut-and-dry of a justifiable police shooting as you will ever find, but not everyone sees it that way. Moore s family and local black activists insist this was a murder and accuse the police of a cover up.Because any time black people complain about something, no matter how little evidence there is to support their claims, the feds come running. The FBI and the US Attorney s Office have launched an investigation based on one little weird thing.Officer Hurst was on his way to work and had yet to report for duty. As such, he didn t have his body cam on and didn t capture the deadly confrontation. The feds figure this must be evidence that the officer is lying, even though all evidence points to the events unfolding the way Hurst said they did.With no actual evidence, the FBI is offering a $10,000 reward to anyone who may have recorded the shooting on a cell phone according to AL.com. Seriously? There isn t any real crime going on so the feds want to spend a big wad of cash to help them build a case against a police officer who was just doing his duty? This is pathetic.Obama s Justice Department has wasted millions upon millions of dollars trying to prove how racist America is and come up with nothing. With expensive investigations into the Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric, Garner, Tamir Rice, and dozens of other black deaths yielding no fruit, the administration seems hell bent on spending as much money as possible to prove Al Sharpton is right about something.Michael Moore was driving a stolen car filled with stolen goods. He had a fake ID and a handgun, which was also stolen. A passenger in his car said Moore had the gun and made a move for it before being shot. Why are the feds even looking at this case?And let s keep in mind that this is the same FBI that didn t see a problem with Omar Mateen, the radical Islamic terrorist who killed 49 people in Orlando.

"Jun 26, 2015","George Soros is sticking his nose into voter ID laws and throwing money into lawsuits in several states to get the law overturned. Is this a true effort to overturn the laws or just an effort to gin the base up to vote? There s absolutely nothing wrong with having voter ID! Soros needs to slither away .Hillary Clinton s top campaign lawyer is behind a multi-state push challenging voter identification laws implemented in recent years, efforts that are expected to reach numerous other states ahead of the 2016 elections.Marc Elias, a top campaign lawyer for Hillary Clinton and a partner at the Washington, D.C., law firm Perkins Coie, has filed lawsuits in three states thus far. The nationwide campaign is being fueled with money from the liberal billionaire George Soros.Elias first began exploring the possible challenges back in January 2014. Soros then became involved, vowing to throw his weight behind the effort in collaboration with Elias. We hope to see these unfair laws, which often disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in our society, repealed,  Soros told the New York Times. It is disingenuous to suggest that these laws are meant to protect against voter fraud, which is nearly nonexistent,  Soros political adviser Michael Vachon added.  Clearly they are meant to give Republicans a political advantage on Election Day. Soros has pledged $5 million to propel the campaign. Elias did not return a request for comment concerning his dealings with Soros or the total number of lawsuits they plan on bringing forward. A request for comment from George Soros s press office was also not returned by press time.Democrats ramped up their efforts last month to challenge voter ID laws implemented by Republican legislatures and governors, claiming that the laws disenfranchise minority voters.The first in the series of lawsuits was filed in Ohio on May 8. Three weeks later, on June 1, a second suit was filed in Wisconsin. On June 11, a third lawsuit was filed in Virginia. Further suits are expected to follow in other states.Elias is working independently on behalf of his firm, Perkins Coie, though the Clinton camp supports the effort. Perkins Coie has pulled in more than $40 million from Democratic clients since 2000.The suits came as Hillary Clinton made comments about voting in a number of public speeches.During a speech in Houston on June 4 at historically black Texas Southern University, Hillary Clinton called for a universal, automatic voter registration for 18-year-olds along with early voting up to 20 days before an election. I call on Republicans at all levels of government with all manner of ambition to stop fear-mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they re so scared of letting citizens have their say,  Clinton said during the speech.True the Vote, a right-leaning vote-monitoring organization, sees the campaign as a political stunt to rile up apathetic voters who may not have the same excitement for Clinton as they did for Obama.Read more: WFB",COMMIE GEORGE SOROS AND CLINTON LAWYER MAKE A PUSH TO OVERTURN VOTER ID LAWS IN SEVERAL STATES

You really can t blame the citizens for being furious at their leaders for allowing the invasion of Muslim immigrants into their hometowns and major cities. If this sentiment catches fire in America this summer, it will not likely bode well for Crooked Hillary at the polls in November, given that Trump is the ultimate non-establishment politician History professor Gudni Johannesson won Iceland s presidential election after riding a wave of anti-establishment sentiment, final results showed Sunday, although the vote was eclipsed by the country s eagerly-anticipated Euro football match.The political newcomer, who won with 39.1 percent of votes, was trailed by businesswoman Halla Tomasdottir, also without party affiliation, who took 29.4 percent, according to results announced on public television channel RUV.Johannesson only decided to run for the presidency after the so-called Panama Papers leak in April which detailed offshore accounts and implicated several senior Icelandic politicians, including the prime minister who was forced to resign.Throughout the campaign, Johannesson emphasised his non-partisan vision of the presidency, and vowed to restore faith in the political system after years of public anger toward politicians over scandals and financial woes.The victory was especially sweet for the history professor and political commentator, who has never held public office and has no party affiliation, as he celebrated his 48th birthday Sunday.David Oddsson, a former conservative prime minister who had been Johannesson s closest rival throughout most of the campaign, garnered just 13 percent of votes. The representative of the old era  has been rejected, people are looking to the future,  University of Akureyri political science professor Gretar Eythorsson told AFP.The president in Iceland holds a largely ceremonial position. More important legislative elections are due in the autumn.But the outrage that fuelled mass street protests in April and led to ousting of premier Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson appeared to have dissipated somewhat as euphoria erupted over the Icelandic football squad achieving a historic feat in the Euro 2016 football tournament.A North Atlantic island of just 334,000 people, Iceland beat Austria 2-1 on Wednesday to qualify for the last 16 in its first major international competition, and will face off against England on Monday.Britain s vote to leave the European Union also headlined the news on the eve of the election in Iceland, which itself had applied for EU membership in 2009 after suffering a devastating financial crisis in 2008, but abandoned the bid six years later.Like most of Iceland s voters, Johannesson is opposed to EU membership.

That product powers refers to is tons and tons of meth, heroin and pot transferred through a labyrinth of tunnels from Mexico.Drugs that are headed for the streets of the U.S.But these tunnels could easily be an underground highway for ISIS to spawn its brutality here.Sioux City   KMEG 14, FOX 44, News, Weather, Sports The stronger they get over there, the more power they have so I can definitely see, in the future, collaboration between terrorist groups and drug dealers to our south,  said Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, 2016 Presidential Candidate It s individuals they bring into this country, maybe at some point, suicide bombers which is really scary and then weapons of mass destruction,  said Powers.Terrorist experts say the epidemic of unstable leadership in Mexico, combined with ruthless drug cartels creates a vacuum. What s been going on in Mexico creates an opportunity for any organization to try to take advantage of it, whether it s ISIS or Al Shabbab,  said Brandon Behlendorf, Terrorist Targeting Strategist.Two major drug cartels that could attract ISIS cover a lot of land in Mexico. Both skirt the U.S. border.The Sinalos Federation takes up western Mexico and borders Texas to California.Los Zetas occupies eastern Mexico and hugs the southern Texas border.Experts say Al Qaeda already tried linking up with drug lords in Mexico roughly 15 years ago. But to no avail.But Isis is far more determined than Al Qaeda. It makes logical sense for ISIS to do this,  said powers.  But I do not think they ll be catching the intelligence agencies off guard, because this has been a persistent problem whether it was Al Qaeda or any other group.

"Jun 27, 2017","President Donald Trump welcomed India s Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House Monday for their first meeting, as the U.S. branded a top militant from neighboring Pakistan as a  global terrorist. The leaders of the world s two largest democracies are looking to expand ties on defense and fighting terrorism, but strains are likely on trade. Their personal chemistry could prove as important as policy in setting the tone for relations.During brief Oval Office remarks, Trump heaped praise on Modi as a  great prime minister  who had brought economic growth to India. Modi recalled Trump s visits to India long before he was president and said he was looking forward to collaborating with him now that he is president. The relationship between the United States and India is very, very strong and very, very powerful,  Trump said.  We agree on most things. And I would say, by the end of the day we ll agree on everything. I have a feeling,  he joked.Meanwhile back in India, a village is so enamored with President Trump that they ve renamed their village after him: #News: As @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's popularity soars abroad, a village in #India renames itself ""Trump"" to honour their American hero.   pic.twitter.com/3ogNWWcwMA   l g s  (@Maximus_4EVR) June 27, 2017Hours before Modi s arrival, the State Department imposed sanctions on Syed Salahuddin, the Pakistan-based leader of Hizbul Mujahideen, the main rebel group that fights against Indian control in the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir.

"Jun 28, 2015","It s too early to endorse Hillary? What s Al Gore waiting for? It s clear that Hillary is the anointed one for the Democrats so why would he wait and who would he be waiting for if not HRC?Al Gore declined to back Hillary Clinton for president when asked who he thinks would be next in the White House.When questioned by WPP founder Sir Martin Sorrell at the Cannes Lions festival of creativity about whom he would back for 2016, Gore   Bill Clinton s vice president from 1993 to 2001  notably didn t take the chance to praise Hillary. In a packed Cannes Lions session Friday, Sorrell asked Gore,  Would you refuse to answer the question [who will be the next president of the United States]?  Gore responded,  I wouldn t refuse to answer that question, I would try to cleverly dodge the question   I would say it s actually too early.  Gore merely smiled, but didn t comment further, after Sorrell added,  I think Hillary will win and it would be great to have a female president of the most powerful nation on the planet.  Gore has reportedly had a complicated relationship with the Clintons since 2000. Political insiders speculate Gore may be remaining neutral for now but would eventually back the Democratic nominee. Gore last October described Hillary in an interview with Bloomberg as an  extremely capable person,  adding she did an excellent job as secretary of state and a New York senator. But he also said it was too early and  I am not going to engage in horse race analysis before the horses even go to the gate.  The former vice president used his speech at Cannes to call on the ad and creative world to help him in his fight against climate change. When asked about climate deniers, Gore said it was a campaign run by polluters and compared their actions to the tobacco industry, which employed actors posing as doctors to reassure consumers that smoking was safe:  It was deeply unethical, immoral, destructive, really evil, and that is exactly what the climate denial industry is doing.  Gore believes global warming would be a big issue at the next election:  The age of fossil fuels is beginning to end   years ago a Saudi minister once said,  The stone age didn t end because of a shortage of stones.

"Jun 29, 2015","The children were greeted at the Capitol steps in the communist state of Wisconsin by protestors singing hate songs with signs that read: Republicans and Walker rape or molest women and girls.APPLETON, Wis.   I don t frequent the Capitol building in Madison so I just assumed the  Capitol Singers,  a group protesting Governor Scott Walker in song had faded away.I learned recently however that they are, as a line censored out of the sitcom  Last Man Standing  said of the Clintons,  They re like shingles; just when you think they are gone, they pop back up. I received an email recently from a listener to my radio show who chaperoned a field trip his daughter s 4th grade class at Horizons Elementary School in Appleton took to the State Capitol in late May. The story he shared was simply stunning:Everyone on the field trip to the capitol was eating lunch on the capitol steps. At the same time there was a group of people protesting Walker and Act 10 singing hate songs and holding up signs saying that Republicans and Walker rape or molest women and girls.Another parent pointed out to me that my daughter s teacher was down there singing with them. I thought that I needed to find out what was actually being sung down there because a bunch of students were down there listening and recording on their cell phones what was happening. That is when I realized that they were singing terrible hate songs against Walker and what the signs said.By the way, her teacher was holding a piece of paper with the words they were singing on it. When the kids were on their way back up they started chanting  Walker sucks  and some other mean things. That s when I stopped them and asked why they were doing that and they didn t know what to say. I asked three times and one of the boys spoke up and said that Mr. Niquette was just doing it also. That is my daughter s teacher.Feeling it inappropriate to confront the teacher in front of children, the parent contacted the school to see if such behavior violated school policy. He ended up in an email exchange with the teacher, Scott Niquette:Scott, my issue is you going down there and singing with those people on the field trip.Did you see the signs they were holding? I m guessing that you saw the words you were reading off the sheet you were holding. Do you understand what the children were doing after they saw you down there singing? Scott there is video of you singing that hate Walker song.When the kids were walking back up the hill they were chanting hate speech toward Walker until I stopped them and asked them why. The answer was obvious. Someone with influence in their lives was doing the same thing. You have influence on these children and they trust that you will lead them. For crying out loud Scott those signs were way inappropriate. Talking about molesting children and raping women.In a show of Olympian chutzpah, Niquette pleaded ignorance in his response:With respect to the Capitol Singers, I joined them during my lunch break simply because I enjoy singing. I am currently an active member in our church s choir  I honestly did not see or notice any signs regarding molesting children or raping women when I entered the circle of singers. If I had, I can assure you that a most certainly would have immediately left. Again, I joined them simply because I enjoy singing. With respect to my teaching, I also take that very seriously and take great offense to accusations that I do not  You have visited my classroom on numerous occasions and sat in on a few lessons. What did you see and hear I stick to the objectives and leave the politics out.He couldn t resist joining a group of Scott Walker haters in public but we re supposed to trust he keeps politics out of the classroom? He didn t see what the signs said? He was unclear of the lyrics he was singing off a sheet?I reached out to Horizons principal Karen Brice. Initially she told me she hadn t heard of the incident and frankly found it hard to believe. But she told me she would look into it. A few days later she called me back, saying only that school officials were investigating to determine whether district policy had been violated.Then there is this classic line from Niquette in his email response to the parent:In retrospect, however, I do think I will save singing with the Capitol Singers for a time when I am at the capitol of my own accord to better reduce any opportunities of misunderstanding.Via: EAG News",PARENT FURIOUS AFTER 4TH GRADE CLASS JOINS HATEFUL PROTESTORS AND TEACHER IN CHANT ON CAPITOL STEPS: “[Governor] Walker Sucks!”

"Jun 3, 2015","Unfortunately, our troops have been affected most by the ignorance of the American voter who couldn t see through the  smoke and mirrors  of the world s most successful con artist A CNN poll released Wednesday shows that George W. Bush is not only more popular than President Obama, a majority of Americans now view the former president in a positive light. A full 52% see Bush favorably, compared to just 43% who do not. Only 49% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Obama. The same number, 49%, do not.Obama s job approval numbers also took a serious dive in the CNN poll. Just last month, the president sat at a 48% approval rating, with just 47% disapproving. Not great, but he was at least above water. Today Obama is upside down a full 7 points, with just 45% approving of his job and a clear majority of 52% disapproving.That s an 8 point drop.On the specifics of his job, other than race relations, Obama is upside down, sometimes by huge margins, in every category: economy 46-53; ISIS 32-63; race relations 50-47; Climate Change 41-49; illegal immigration 36-60; government surveillance 29-67; health care 44-54; foreign affairs 43-55; terrorism 45-51.Since last month, Obama s numbers have worsened considerably on the specific issues of ISIS, immigration, and surveillance.Bush s favorability increase   his first in positive territory since leaving office   is likely due to two things. First, Bush has been nothing but a class act as a former president. He has stayed out of the public eye, except to further the causes like those of America s wounded warriors. He s removed himself completely from politics. People appreciate a class act, and Bush has been nothing but.Secondly, Bush s approval numbers were primarily dragged down by the Iraq War. In hindsight, though, the American people are now seeing that conflict now through a contextual prism they did not have before.As in all wars, major mistakes were made in Iraq. It is only in the television era, especially the 24/7 cable era, that this historical fact of conflict has been turned into something unique and a disqualifier. Nevertheless, Bush won the war in Iraq. The surge won the war in Iraq. It s harder to end a war than begin one. Indeed, everything that American troops have done in Iraq -  all the fighting and all the dying, the bleeding and the building, and the training and the partnering -  all of it has led to this moment of success. Now, Iraq is not a perfect place. It has many challenges ahead. But we re leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people. We re building a new partnership between our nations. This is an extraordinary achievement, nearly nine years in the making. That is not Bush announcing the Iraq War a success, that is President Obama   just before he lost the war in an election year gambit by removing all of our troops, including the kind of stabilizing forces we still have in other countries like Korea and Japan.Compared to Obama s handling of foreign affairs, specifically in the Middle East, the Bush-era is getting a second look outside of the unceasing partisan politics and venomous media frenzies that defined his presidency. It was a long tough road to get there, but by the time Bush left office, things were better in the Middle East. The region had stabilized, or was at least stabilizing. Egypt, Libya, Iraq, and Afghanistan were all quiet or at least quieting. Our years-long engagement, sometimes at a terrible price, had made a positive difference.Obama s cynical political disengagement overseas has come at an even more terrible price. The region is on fire. Iraq is nearly lost. Libya is a terrorist haven. ISIS is on the march everywhere, especially in Obama s Iraq vacuum.War is tough and bloody and difficult and fraught with mistakes. That was true before the television age. It is true now. How would CNN cover an audacious, costly, and largely symbolic Doolittle Raid on Tokyo today? Imagine Lincoln dealing with a Washington Post, New York Times, and Wolf Blitzer in the first few years of the Civil War. It s only after you remove all the political and media smoke that one can gain a perspective.That smoke is mostly dissipated, and the American people can now see that things were better under Bush. It was hell to get there but in the end he won his war. Obama is losing everywhere and showing none of the grit to win Bush did at this time in his own presidency.Obama was supposed to be the cure for all the Bush-era ills. Democrats and the media promised us that.The American people are now realizing that the so-called cure is much worse than the problem, a problem that, as we can see now, did not need fixing.Via: Breitbart News",MISS ME YET?

New businesses across America are being strangled by  faceless bureaucrats and politicians who erroneously believe that government  can do it better.    Bernie MarcusHome Depot founder and former Jeb Bush-backer Bernie Marcus has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying the  fate of the nation  hangs on sending him to the White House over Hillary Clinton. Writing for Real Clear Politics, the leading businessman said new businesses across America were being strangled by  faceless bureaucrats and politicians who erroneously believe that government  can do it better . I genuinely believe that if we to started The Home Depot today, we would fail because of the hurdles government, especially the current administration, places in front of small business owners,  he writes.Obama-style government, he adds, is  driving over-regulation, over-taxation, over-litigation, and over-spending  and thus  killing small businesses, which create the majority of new jobs in America. Politicians like Obama and Clinton, aided by the media and academia, have peddled a dangerous sentiment that government can provide for Americans better than the private sector.

My sense is that the rate these hypotheticals are going, you re bound to hear that a future president working on a trade deal might have second thoughts about the Louisiana purchase.But in an interview on NPR s Marketplace yesterday (June 3), President Obama said that enforcing climate change regulations will indeed be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Obamatrade pact that he is currently negotiating with Malaysia and 10 other countries.

"Jun 5, 2016","Bernie Sanders likes to talk about how everyone will be equal using other people s money. It s the most asinine concept and it s not like it hasn t been tried before. We love Larry Elder s personal take on equality and the common sense reasons there will NEVER be total equality especially INCOME EQUALITY:Is there a more brain-dead concept than to empower the government to fight  income inequality ? What sane, normal, rational human being thinks that human talent, drive, interests and opportunity can   or should   result in equal outcomes?Despite my love of athletics, I knew in third grade that my friend, Keith, could run much faster than I could. For two years I played Little League ball, and I got better at it. But no matter how hard I tried or how many hours I spent, I could not hit, run or throw as well as my friend Benji.Later in life, I started playing tennis, and I became quite passionate about it. But most of the people I played against had started playing years earlier, and most had taken lessons for years. I got better, but given my competitors  head start, the gap remained.Financial planners advise clients to start early and stick to some sort of game plan. Is there any wonder that those who do so will have more net worth than those who started later, or who lacked the discipline to follow and stick to a plan? How is government supposed to address these  unequal  outcomes?Most entrepreneurs experience failure before hitting on an idea, concept or business that makes money. Even then, it takes 20 to 30 years of long hours and sacrifice, along with occasional self-doubt and a dollop of luck, to become a multimillionaire.I recently saw a movie starring Cate Blanchett. She is a very good actress, but she is also strikingly beautiful. Is there any doubt that her good looks, over which she had no control, are a factor in her success? Is it unfair that an equally talented actress, but with plain looks, will likely have an  unequal  career compared with that of Blanchett?Speaking of acting, most who venture into that field do not become successful, if success is defined as making a living as an actor. These overwhelming odds still do not deter the many young people who flock to Hollywood every year to  make it. Had a would-be actor dedicated that same drive and personality to some other profession, success would have been more likely, if less enjoyable. Should the government intervene and take from the successful non-actor and give to those who unsuccessfully pursued a long-shot acting career? An ex-actor told me of her recent lunch with a friend she had met when they both left college and pursued acting. While the ex-actor moved on to a different, successful career, her friend stuck to acting, through thick and thin. The actor informed her friend that she recently turned down a commercial. Why? What struggling actor turns down this kind of work? Turns out, through some sort of  assistance  program, said the friend, the state of California is  assisting with her mortgage.  She has no obligation to repay the money, and she will continue to receive the assistance as long as her income is not above a certain level. How does this strengthen the economy? The ex-actor, through her taxes, subsidizes the lifestyle of the actor, who admits turning down work lest she be denied the benefits.But this is exactly the world sought by Bernie Sanders   a government that taxes the productive and gives to the less productive in order to reduce  income inequality. In the real world, two individuals, living next door to each other, make different choices about education, careers, spouses, where to live, and if and how to invest. Even if they make exactly the same income, one might live below his or her means, prudently saving money, while the other might choose to regularly buy new cars and fancy clothes and go on expensive vacations. Is there any question that the first person will end up with a higher net worth than the latter? Is their  inequality  something that government should address?Although Beyonce is a good singer, is there any question that there are others with superior voices? But Beyonce is also blessed with  unequally  good looks, charisma and perhaps better management   maybe better than the other two ladies in her musical trio, Destiny s Child, whom she once sang with. Three singers, in the same group, have had  unequal  outcomes.Communism, collectivism and socialism rest on the same premise   that government possesses the kindness, aptitude, judgment and ability to take from some and give to others to achieve  equality.  Karl Marx wrote,  From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.  And that s the problem. The statement implicitly acknowledges that some have more aptitude, drive, energy and ability than others. To take from some and give to others reduces the initiative of both the giver and the givee.This is the fundamental flaw with income redistribution, the very foundation of communism, socialism and collectivism. One would think that Bernie Sanders would have figured this out by now.

Wishful thinking on O Donnell s part As much as they media would like it to be damaging for Comey to testify, Trump wins either way White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read out a statement to that effect on Monday, and O Donnell teased the clip as potentially  the beginning of the end. The video you re about to see might be the video that we re showing you years from now when we re pinpointing the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency,  O Donnell said. The president s power to assert executive privilege is very well established,  Sanders said.  However, in order to facilitate a swift and thorough examination of the facts sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee, President Trump will not assert executive privilege regarding James Comey s scheduled testimony. Comey, who Trump fired last month, will testify on Thursday in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He is expected to discuss his conversations with Trump, which included the president reportedly asking him to  let go  of the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.O Donnell said Trump was  politically unwise enough  to fire Comey but  not bold enough to tell that FBI Director to shut up.

Maybe they figured out that it s not so smart to let rioters destroy your town and then expect the taxpayers to pick up the bloated tab. Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake is having a problem with retaining her staff. Ever since she helped bring the hammer down on six Baltimore police officers over the accidental death of Freddie Gray, four members on her Office on Criminal Justice have resigned. As in, her four highest-ranking cabinet members have each resigned, one by one, over a three-week period. That does not paint a pretty picture on what regard the Baltimore mayor is held in with her staff members. Shannon Cosgrove, deputy director of the office resigned Tuesday. Angela Johnese, director of the criminal justice office, and Heather Brantner, the mayor s Sexual Assault Response Team coordinator, left their positions in the mayor s office on May 22. LeVar Michael, who headed the office s nonviolent programs, left two weeks ago. Not one of the departed provided a reason for leaving. The Rawlings-Blake now faces even further scrutiny as it was determined that the costs incurred to the city stemming from the Baltimore riots exceed $20 million, quite a hike from the initial estimate of $9 million.

"Jun 7, 2017","Andrew McCarthy is just awesome! He goes through the reasons why there is nothing on Trump at all. Tucker Carlson even says at the end of the interview that McCarthy should work in the White house I don t know a single person who works at the White House who can explain things the way you can. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAsy2ob28s0You have to love the common sense and brilliance of McCarthy. Here s a great McCarthy piece from the National Review:Finally, something else about those lawyers. I nearly fell out of my chair upon reading the very first paragraph of the notes of Clinton s interview, which identifies the lawyers for Clinton who were permitted to be present for the interview. Among them is Cheryl Mills, Clinton s longtime confidant and chief-of-staff at the State Department.Readers may recall that I suggested back in May that  the fix  was in in the investigation of the Clinton emails. The reason was that the Justice Department was allowing Cheryl Mills   a witness, if not a subject, of the investigation   to invoke attorney-client privilege on behalf of Mrs. Clinton in order to thwart the FBI s attempt to inquire into the procedure used to produce Clinton s emails to the State Department. Mills was a participant in that procedure   and it is the procedure in which, we now know, well over 30,000 emails were attempted to be destroyed, including several thousand that contained government-related business.When she worked for Clinton at State, Mills was not acting in the capacity of a lawyer   not for then-Secretary Clinton and not for the State Department. Moreover, as Clinton s chief-of-staff, Mills was intimately involved in issues related to Clinton s private email set up, the discussions about getting her a secure BlackBerry similar to President Obama s, and questions that were raised (including in FOIA requests) about Clinton s communications.That is to say, Mills was an actor in the facts that were under criminal investigation by the FBI. Put aside that she was not Mrs. Clinton s lawyer while working for the State Department; as I explained in the May column, Mills, after leaving the State Department, was barred by ethical rules from acting as Mrs. Clinton s lawyer  in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee. There is no way Mills should have been permitted to participate as a lawyer in the process of producing Clinton s emails to the State Department nearly two years after they d both left.I thought it was astonishing that the Justice Department indulged her attorney-client privilege claim, which frustrated the FBI s ability to question her on a key aspect of the investigation. But it is simply unbelievable to find her turning up at Mrs. Clinton s interview   participating in the capacity of a lawyer under circumstances where Clinton was being investigated over matters in which Mills participated as a non-lawyer government official.Read more: NRO",BOOM!

He never went outside without our permission,  said Dr Janjua.  It is fate; Allah s decision. We have to accept it.

"Jun 9, 2015","Why are banking powerhouses, European Prime Ministers, a major arms manufacturer, a representative from the US State Department, Facebook and Google all attending the same secret policy summit? One of Bilderberg s founders and steering committee member, Denis Healey said in 2001:  To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair. Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn t go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing. From The Guardian: As one summit closes, another opens. Thursday sees the start of the influential Bilderberg policy conference, which this year is being held in Austria, just 16 miles south of the G7 summit, and in a similarly inaccessible luxury alpine resort. The participant list for the conference has just been released by the organisation, and some big names leap off the page.No fewer than three serving European prime ministers will be attending, from the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium. They will be discussing  European strategy  with the head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, and the president of Austria, Heinz Fischer. Two European finance ministers are on the list: one Dutch, the other George Osborne. The UK chancellor is a regular attendee of the Bilderberg summit, and this year he will be showing off his post-election glow. Unlike that other Bilderberg regular, Ed Balls, who is being invited back despite having by some considerable distance the weakest job title on the list:  former shadow chancellor of the exchequer.Europe s hottest financial potato, Greece, is on the conference agenda, and it s good to know Beno t Coeur , a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, will be there to discuss it in strictest privacy with interested parties, such as the heads of Deutsche Bank, Lazard, Banco Santander and HSBC.The scandal-hit HSBC and everyone s favourite vampire squid, Goldman Sachs, are both extremely well represented at this year s conference. HSBC in particular by its chairman, its busy chief legal officer, and board member Rona Fairhead, who is also on the board of PepsiCo and chair of the BBC Trust. Good to know the BBC is in such safe hands.Other financial luminaries on the list include the vice-chairman of BlackRock, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset Management and the president of the Royal Bank of Canada, which is the nation s largest financial institution. Morgan Stanley will be represented in Telfs by board member Klaus Kleinfeld, who also runs the world s third largest aluminium producer, Alcoa.From the worlds of industry and manufacturing are some eye-wateringly big names. The CEO of Michelin is invited, along with the head of Roche, the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, the chairman of BP, the CEO of Siemens Austria and the heads of various industrial conglomerates such as Techint and Investor AB, companies so large they re hard to classify. Although  gigantic  goes some way towards it.It s a heady step up into the big league for Michael O Leary, the CEO of Ryanair. He ll doubtless be hoping to thrash out a few last-minute deals over dinner with the head of Airbus, Thomas Enders.Apart from making holiday jets, Airbus is also one of the world s biggest arms manufacturers, and the 2015 conference agenda has a distinct whiff of war. Chemical weapons threats and Nato are both set to be discussed. Luckily the head of Nato is there to discuss it.As ever, foreign policy formation is a big part of the conference. Terrorism and Iran both make the agenda this year, and participants can expect a high-level briefing from senior US State Department official John R Allen, the special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter Isil. And it s likely that the subject of Russia will be of interest to the German defence minister and deputy defence minister, both of whom have found the time this week to be in Telfs. As has the head of the Danish intelligence service, who will likely have a part to play in the session of cybersecurity.Finally, it s worth noting the growing presence of Google at Bilderberg. The company s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, is on the group s steering committee; he ll be joined in Austria by his vice-president for engineering, advanced technology and projects, and the vice-president of engineering for the not-at-all terrifying sounding Google DeepMind. They, presumably, will be leading the session on artificial intelligence. This will be listened to with great interest by Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal and director of Facebook, as he continues his quest to merge with computers. But that s another story.For now, the story is: Bilderberg 2015 has an extremely high-powered participant list, featuring a large number of senior politicians and public figures. With participants this powerful, and an agenda containing this many hot topics, the Telfs policy conference is sure to be covered in depth by the world s press. And by  sure to be , I mean probably won t be. For reasons that, as ever, escape me.Via: The Guardian ",WHY ARE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK ATTENDING BILDERBERG’S 2015 LUXURY SECRET POLICY CONFERENCE?

Also unlike Trump, Gates made his money by selling actual products to people and not on the sort of smoke-and-mirrors flim flam that is currently being exposed at Trump University.At a recent event, the topic of Trump s claim that he donated to veteran s charities came up, and Gates   who heads one of the largest charities in the world   made a dig at the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.Gates took the jab at Trump during an interview alongside his wife, Melinda, at a panel discussion hosted by the news outlet ReCode. He hasn t been known for his philanthropy. He s been known for other things,  Gates said to laughter, when asked if the presumptive GOP presidential nominee had been approached to sign a pledge to give away at least half of his wealth to philanthropic causes.Trump was shown to only cut checks to veteran groups after the Washington Post asked him to back up his boasting about donating $6 million months ago on the same day he boycotted a Fox News debate, arguing that moderator Megyn Kelly had been mean to him.By comparison the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation already has $44 billion at its disposal, thanks to the couple parting with some of the money generated from Microsoft. It has made major investments around the world in education, health, and more.Gates and his wife Melinda are also part of a group of the super-rich who have signed  The Giving Pledge  in which they promise to give more than half of their wealth to charity during their lifetimes, or in their wills. Several real life billionaires have signed the pledge, including Warren Buffett, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison and others. But they haven t approached Trump yet.Melinda Gates, with a smirk, said the couple has not approached Trump, adding that they are still working their way down Fortune s list of billionaires. We don t have any immediate plans to approach him,  she said.  I think we should probably let this cycle play itself out before we do anything related to that. Gates may just be being polite. Previous reporting has indicated that Trump may not even be worth $1 billion, far less than the $10 billion he has been claiming. He has refused to release his tax returns, which some believe proves he is hiding that he is a millionaire and not a billionare.Featured image via Flickr", Richest Man In The World Puts Trump In His Place On Donating To Charity

They also report on other natural events affected by the weather. So, to express their displeasure at Trump s completely idiotic move, they ve done this to their front page:Yeah.

Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen called it  a sad day,  while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is  deeply disappointed that the United States federal government has decided to withdraw from the Paris agreement. Italy, France and Germany released a joint statement blasting Trump over the idea that he can pull us out and then remake the agreement into something far more to his liking: We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies.

"June 10, 2016","Friday was Sasha Obama s 15th birthday. All around the nation, people sent her warm birthday wishes as the media admired her evolution from the President s adorable child to a smart, classy young lady. To make the day even more special, it was also the day her big sister Malia graduated from high school, something that was largely celebrated across the nation as the eldest First Daughter prepares to go to Harvard after a gap year.Even conservatives got in on wishing Sasha a happy birthday   though their greetings were of a very different nature to those most shared. Right-wing trash dispensary and ridiculously-named Facebook page, The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense, posted a question for their racist, uneducated, Trump-loving followers. A photo of Sasha was accompanied by the words,  What message do you have for Sasha Obama on her birthday? To start off the social media lynching, the conservative propagandists added the message,  I know what Id tell ANY Obama I came face to face with. Following like lemmings, the Stupid Part of America obliged, doing what they were told. They shared what they would love to say to a teenage girl not yet old enough to drive, whose father happens to be President of the United States. Though she has never embroiled herself in any controversy, said anything negative to anyone, and is  a fucking teenager, the horrible people who follow that page unleashed their hatred, calling her a  spoiled brat,  demanding that she  go back to Kenya  (where she is certainly not from), ordering her out of the White House, calling her a monkey,  and even suggesting that she be raped.              I took a moment to speak with one of the page administrators about the post. It went pretty much how you d expect. I opened with a nice, super-professional greeting and a simple query about the post. The administrator responded with complete nonsense, asked me a question, then blocked me:This isn t the first time Sasha Obama has been a target of Right-Wing hate. In 2013, conservatives circulated a disgusting Photoshopped picture showing President Obama with his hand down Sasha s pants.This was widely circulated, with the creator and friends even providing  evidence  that Barack Obama was stupid enough to molest his daughter, in public with cameras rolling, in front of the rest of his family.It is unknown why conservatives do the things that they do, but one thing is important to remember: all of these people will be voting for Trump in November.

"June 10, 2017","So many questions have come up in the wake of James Comey s Senate testimony. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is again asking the harsh but necessary question,  What do the Russians have on Donald Trump? Pretty much everyone is in agreement that Thursday s testimony by James Comey was totally devastating for Trump. Even Trump s buddies over at Fox News are admitting it was  very damaging for the president. By far the most incriminating statement made by Comey was that he couldn t  remember any conversations with the president about the Russia election. The fact the Russia attempted to control the outcome of the U.S. presidential election is indisputable at this point. What s curious is that Trump had no interest in the fact that our democracy was attacked and how we remain susceptible to attacks in the future.This total lack of concern for foreign election hijack prompted Pelsoi in a press conference on Friday to ask some critical questions. So again I ask the question, What do the Russians have on Donald Trump   politically, personally, or financially   that he just won t go to that place and instead enshrines them, sings and dances to their tune. And Republicans in Congress have been resistant to finding it   have resisted finding out the truth. So I think there are other remedies that we can exhaust. I respect the opinion of those who think he should come.

"June 11, 2016","According to Pastor Darrell Reid, he was cleaning his gun inside the home he shared with his wife of 35 years on Monday, when the gun accidentally  went off,  shooting her in the head.Reid s wife, Katie, was rushed to Apopka Hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later.According to the Christian Post, the couple met when they were 12 years old. They ran a church called  Happy Hill Ministries  out of their home, located in Zellwood, Florida.It appears that the couple s outward appearance of happiness wasn t quite the reality.WKMG reports that police were called to the pastor s home on 23 separate occasions over the past three years.Reid was arrested multiple times for violent crimes. According to WKMG, the pastor was most recently charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, but the charge was never prosecuted. He was also charged with resisting a police officer with violence in 2012. That charge was also never prosecuted.WKMG reports:A close family friend who didn t want to be identified told News 6 the couple had a violent relationship.Reid s attorney, on the other hand, told the Orlando Sentinel that the couple  seemed very close,  noting that  they always came to court together. A neighbor said that while he couldn t imagine that Reid intentionally killed his wife, he also has a hard time understanding how you can  accidentally  shoot someone while cleaning a gun.Judging from his criminal background, Reid was someone who should never have been allowed to posses a gun. Police had been called to the couple s home almost two dozen times.  He was charged with multiple violent crimes, yet his status as a white, Christian minister no doubt helped him walk away from those crimes unpunished, time and time again.According to the website smartgunlaws.org:Florida law does not explicitly authorize or require the removal or surrender of firearms at the scene of a domestic violence incident.Police are currently investigating the  accidental  shooting death of 62-year-old Katie Reid.In the meantime, Darrell Reid remains free and likely in possession of a gun.Featured image via Happy Hill Ministries", FL Pastor ‘Accidentally’ Shoots Wife In The Head While Cleaning Gun
"June 11, 2017","Over the last nine years or so, there has been one cardinal rule in Republican politics: Never, ever say anything good about President Barack Obama. In a sign that things may be changing, that things might soon start looking a little less partisan, one major Republican   one whose career ambitions were thwarted by Obama in 2008   has made a stunning admission. Sen. Jon McCain said America was better off under Obama than it is under Trump. No, you aren t dreaming.McCain, once blamed the shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando on Obama Barack Obama is directly responsible for it, because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, Al Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama s failures, utter failures, by pulling everybody out of Iraq. So the responsibility for it lies with President Barack Obama and his failed policies. Source: LA TimesThe Orlando shooter was American born and raised, but why let an inconvenient fact get in the way?McCain seems to have had a change of heart about Obama s foreign policies, though, at least after five months under Donald Trump. In an interview with the Guardian, McCain was asked about Trump s foreign policy, specifically in relation to the United Kingdom. As you recall, after a deadly terrorist attack in London, Trump, rather than offering condolences and assistance to one of our greatest allies, took to Twitter to pick a fight with the city s mayor, who happens to be Muslim.After Mayor Sadiq Khan said after the attack that Londoners need not be alarmed by the increased police presence, Trump took the words out of context to make it sound as if he wasn t taking the attack seriously.At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is  no reason to be alarmed!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017Then when Khan responded, Trump said this:Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his  no reason to be alarmed  statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017While Trump hasn t exactly been disinvited from his scheduled state visit, he disinvited himself over concerns that there might be protests. In other words, Trump seems to be choosing to ignore whatever parts of the world aren t nice to him. So far, we have Saudi Arabia and Russia.When the Guardian asked McCain about Trump and Great Britain, he said this:Senator John McCain, a prominent Republican voice on foreign policy, was visibly irked when asked by the Guardian what message Trump had sent to the United Kingdom, one of America s most enduring allies. What do you think the message is? The message is that America doesn t want to lead,  McCain said, while adding of the rest of the world:  They are not sure of American leadership, whether it be in Siberia or whether it be in Antarctica. Asked if America s standing on the global stage was better under Barack Obama, McCain, a fervent critic of the previous administration s foreign policy, responded:  As far as American leadership is concerned, yes. While McCain isn t always in lock-step with his party, he has become increasingly partisan in recent years. He endorsed Donald Trump during the election and in last week s Senate hearing for fired FBI Director James Comey, McCain focused only on Hillary Clinton s emails, completely ignoring possible Trump/Russia connections. Still, this could be the sign of a changing tide. It only takes a handful of Republicans to realize that Trump is sending the nation on a dangerous course and it needs to stop.", John McCain Shockingly Admits Obama Was A Better President Than Trump And The World Didn’t Fly Off Its Axis
"June 12, 2016","During a telephone interview with CNN s Jake Tapper, Florida Governor Rick Scott carefully avoided any acknowledgement that the gay community had been targeted in the June 12 mass shooting, which left 50 people dead and 53 more injured in Orlando.During the interview, Tapper pointed out that the gay community  appears to have been directly targeted in the attack.  He went on to acknowledge the impact the shooting has had on Florida s LGBT community, saying: There are a lot of members of that community and supporting friends and family who are very worried. Obviously if this was radical Islam, which the special agent in charge of the FBI suggested it may have been, that is a community that has been under siege from radical Islam. Tapper asked Scott what steps are being taken to protect Florida s gay and lesbian community from further threats.Scott refused to acknowledge the gay community, instead providing a generic, barely coherent statement in response to the question, saying: We don t want anybody in our state to ever be targeted. We don t want anybody to be discriminated against. And so in every case, when we believe there is somebody doing the wrong thing, we work hard to make sure we take care of them. He went on to explain: And so what we ll   you know, as we go through this process, what we ll learn through this, is we ll learn what we can do to hopefully to never, never, ever to let this happen again. Tapper pressed the issue, apparently hoping that Florida s right-wing governor was capable of giving a response that addressed the needs of the LGBT community in his state. But, I guess my point is,  Tapper responded,  you ve declared a state of emergency in Orange County, but there are areas of the state of Florida   South Beach, for example   where there may be a large and thriving LGBT community that might be very, very afraid this morning. He again asked Scott about the precautions his administration is taking to protect members of the gay community, and specifically asked whether there would be additional law enforcement presence to protect against possible copycat attacks or on the off chance that the shooter wasn t acting alone.While it seems clear from the interview that Tapper was hoping to get Scott to reach out to members of the LGBT community in his own state following the deadliest mass shooting in history, Scott never did that.Instead he offered more generic assurances about how the state responds  when something like this happens.  Scott said,  one of the first things you do on top of dealing with the issue you have at hand, is say,  Who else could this impact and what can we do to make sure that does not happen? When asked what people can do to help, Scott responded by saying  They can pray. This is what a truly incompetent leader sounds like.Watch the interview below, courtesy of Raw Story on YouTube.

"June 12, 2017","Donald Trump continues to be the biggest pain in the a** for White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who seems to visibly hate his job more and more each day.Earlier today, Spicer crashed and burned during his press briefing when reporters cornered him and asked him why Trump refused to release the alleged  tapes  and recordings of the private conversations between himself and former FBI Director James Comey. This was a hot topic, considering that Trump had just accused Comey of lying under oath last week, when Comey said Trump demanded that he drop the investigation on Michael Flynn, Trump s former National Security Adviser.When a reporter questioned Spicer about why Trump wouldn t give up the recordings if they could prove Comey had lied during his hearing, it was clear that Spicer wanted to hide behind the bushes again. Spicer stumbled over his words and said: I think the president made it clear on Friday that he would get back as soon as possible on this. Things got even more humiliating as the reporter pressed Spicer further, So what s he waiting for, what s the delay? It looked like Spicer had completely given up defending Trump or trying to come up with a more clever response. Instead, Spicer said: He s waiting for  he s not waiting for anything. When he s ready to further discuss it, he will, but he laid out his position very clearly, very concisely on Friday. You can watch this very awkward press briefing below:Trump has gotten himself in such a mess with this whole Russia thing that not even his own team knows how to defend him anymore.

"June 13, 2016","The creator of Family Guy responded on Sunday to the Orlando mass shooting and humiliated a couple of gun nuts along the way.On Saturday, a gunman killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Florida. It is now the worst mass shooting in American history and has reignited the calls for gun safety regulations.And comedian Seth MacFarlane added his voice to those making such calls by calling for a ban on automatic weapons in a post on Twitter. These shootings are a regular occurrence,  MacFarlane wrote.  You don t get to be  shocked  anymore unless you take action to stop them. Ban automatic weapons.

Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016Of course, a couple gun nuts took issue with MacFarlane s call to action.One Twitter user claimed that MacFarlane s call to ban automatic weapons would be like banning planes after the 9/11 attacks. The voice of Peter Griffin responded that unlike guns, planes aren t designed to kill people. RT @JIMDETHOMAS: @SethMacFarlane should ve banned planes after 9/11. // A plane s primary function is not to kill. Get the difference?  Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016A second gun nut posted the dubious conservative claim that if a single person had been carrying a gun that night less people would have been killed. MacFarlane responded with the fact that there hasn t been a single example of a  good guy with a gun  preventing a mass shooting in progress.RT @xNathan30x: one person carrying a concealed handgun in that club could have ended that horror. // Often stated, never once happened.

Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016Banning automatic weapons is not the only way to reduce gun violence. We need a better background check system and we need to ban people on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy guns. Plus, we desperately need better mental healthcare in this country. But Republicans in Congress refuse to do anything that will upset their NRA masters, and that s why we can expect more mass shootings unless we send people to Congress who will take action to prevent gun violence instead of simply offering useless thoughts and prayers.Featured image via Wikimedia"," Seth MacFarlane Responds To Orlando Shooting, Smacks Down Gun Nuts (TWEETS)"
"June 13, 2017","Donald Trump has to be the most corrupt  president  America has ever seen. After his infamous firing of FBI Director James Comey over the investigation into his campaign s ties to Russia, Trump was reportedly infuriated that his racist elf of an Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from all things related to Russia. Then, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein saw fit to appoint former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a Special Counsel to get to the bottom of the Russia matter. Now, it seems that Mueller, who enjoys broad bipartisan support and has an impeccable reputation in Washington, is now in Trump s crosshairs. In fact, it is now being reported that Trump wanted to fire Mueller, and was only stopped by his own White House staff, because any thinking person knows that this would be a political   and potentially legal- disaster.The rumors of Trump s intention to fire Mueller were first fueled by an interview that Newsmax CEO and close Trump confidante Christopher Ruddy gave to PBS Newshour. In that interview, Ruddy said of what he knew of Trump s paranoid thinking on the matter: I think he s considering perhaps terminating the special counsel. I think he s weighing that option. Well, Trump had better get that option out of his head; after all, even the GOP sycophants in Congress are saying that this is a bridge too far, and that Trump needs to leave Special Counsel Mueller alone and let him do his investigation. Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), who is the Ranking Member on the House Intelligence Committee has already told Trump that going after Mueller would be a waste of time, because Congress would intervene.If President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately re-establish independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller. Don't waste our time.  Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) June 12, 2017Trump is acting like Richard Nixon did toward the end of Watergate.

"June 14, 2016","As the GOP presidential nominee, Republicans have, as of late, been grudgingly getting behind Donald Trump. Following the massacre in Orlando, though, it seems that Senate Republicans can t stomach the thought of even mentioning Trump s name anymore. On Capitol Hill, the mood is one of depression, fatigue, and giving up and of simmering anger.Instead of being classy and offering condolences, or even just saying he was saddened at the loss of so many lives, Trump gloated over being right about radical Islam, and said we need toughness and vigilance. Then he expanded his  ban all Muslims  policy proposal to include people from any country with any history of terrorism, and said he d accomplish that through executive order.Can we say  despotic? He also blamed Obama for the attack by calling him weak, and insinuating he might even be helping the terrorists.That might be what his drone-like fans want to hear, but putting the blame on Obama was what sent Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) over the edge on Trump. He told Politico: I m not going to be commenting on presidential candidates today. That s it. That s all. He s spent a lot of time explaining what Trump needs to do differently, and how he needs to tone it down, and it s fallen on deaf ears. So, at least for a day, McConnell is done.Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX), the number two Republican in the Senate, also brushed off any discussion of Trump   except he s so sick of the guy that he went several steps further than McConnell. He doesn t plan on talking about Trump at all for the next five months. He ended his talk with Politico by saying: Wish me luck. He s going to need it.Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), whose name has been bandied about as a possible VP pick for Trump, is upset about what Trump said during a foreign policy speech following Orlando. Politico says Corker is normally very talkative, but he would only say: I don t know that I really have a lot to say. Apparently he said that twice, but he eventually spoke a little bit about King Trump s speech: It wasn t the type (of address) that one would expect a person who is wanting to lead the greatest nation in the world to make. Fifty people have perished, and [53] more have been harmed. Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Richard Burr (R-NC) had nothing to say about Trump at all, according to Politico, except for a hurried comment from Burr about going to read Trump s speech. He then disappeared into an elevator.Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) also slammed Trump s remarks, saying: I think his comments are inappropriate when the nation is in mourning over the worst terrorism attack that we ve had since 9/11. She s not even sure she ll be able to make herself vote for Trump, according to Politico.Trump s more outspoken critics on Capitol Hill, such as Senators Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), continued to be outspoken as they slammed Trump s reaction to Orlando. But it was Flake s comments that hint at the strong possibility that Trump just sounded the death knell for his own campaign: He s won 13 million votes total so far; he s got to get 65 million or so to win the general election, which includes a lot of independents and Republicans that don t feel as he does. He can t win the general election talking the way he is. The latest Bloomberg poll shows Hillary Clinton leading Trump nationally by 12 points. Bloomberg says that Orlando has had little effect on the 2016 campaign, but that s likely to change as Trump continues to try and talk tough and falls flat on face with those who are reluctant about supporting him.Senate Republicans have been hoping for months that he would stop being the offensive, bombastic candidate that embodies everything shameful about America s conservative wing. But he s a particular problem for the Senate, because he could end up being the reason Republicans lose both the White House and the Senate in November.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", GOP’s Stunning Reactions To Trump’s Remarks On Orlando Show That His Election Chances Are Dead
"June 14, 2017","For perhaps the first time since Donald Trump hit the political scene, he didn t make a bad situation worse by saying something self-serving and inappropriate in the response to the shooting of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise (Louisiana) during a practice of the GOP congressional baseball team.Trump said: We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation s capital is here because, above all, they love our country,  Trump said.  We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good. Source: Chicago TribunePresident Obama, who still knows many of the members of Congress, also responded   with the class and deference we have come to expect. Obama reached out to Jeff Flake (R-Arizona), who was on the field during the shooting, and despite being on the opposite side of the political aisle, was a friend of the former President.Flake was among the Republicans gathered on an Alexandria, Va., baseball field when a shooter opened fire, wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) and several others. Obama maintained a good working relationship with Flake, who flew out to Arizona with the former president in 2011 after the shooting of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). This is particularly raw for those of us in Arizona,  Flake told reporters of Tuesday s shooting, adding that Obama asked him to let Scalise know the former president is thinking about him.  He went through this a couple of times,  Flake added of Obama.Source: PoliticoOf course, many will question why Obama didn t call all the Congresspeople who were on the field that day and the answer is quite simple. He doesn t want to make it about himself. He simply wanted to send well wishes to a friend. That s class. Of course, it could also be that he is weary from addressing all the mass shootings during his administration.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images"," After D.C.

"June 15, 2016","Only days after the worst mass shooting in the nation s history happened against the LGBT community, the GOP decided they could go back to being discriminatory.One would think they d wait at least a week, but apparently three days seemed long enough to mourn the loss of those who perished at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, because according to Vanity Fair:Republican leaders in the House of Representatives blocked a vote on a proposal that would ensure federal contractors can t discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identification.That s right, you read that correctly, they seem to think it s perfectly acceptable for federal contractors to be able to fire someone for being gay.According to The Hill:Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), who is gay, filed an amendment to a Defense Department spending bill that would enforce a 2014 executive order prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people.Yet, the House Rules Committee didn t see it worthy of consideration and wouldn t even allow it to be voted upon. Nope, not even a vote. Not even a chance.Apparently, the House GOP doesn t want anything added to the annual spending bills for fear that it may inhibit passage. You know, because adding non-discriminatory amendments for LGBT people in a House of Representatives full of GOP bigots doesn t go over well and could clog up business as usual.As The Hill explains:House GOP leaders decided to clamp down on amendments to annual spending bills after Maloney s proposal threatened passage of other appropriations measures last month. Before now, Republicans had been considering appropriations bills under a procedure allowing members of either party to offer unlimited amendments.Don t you see, they only want to play by their rules. If you re not doing something they like, well, then they will make sure it never happens, but guaranteed if it was the other way around, the story would be verrrry different.This just proves, yet again, that Republicans only care about themselves.Featured Photo by Allison Shelley/Getty Images", The GOP Didn’t Waste Any Time Going Back To Hating Gay People With What They Just Did

"June 16, 2016","Senator John McCain is in damage control mode after he openly accused President Obama of being  directly responsible  for the mass shooting in Orlando, thus going even further than Donald Trump s attacks of the president.In the wake of the attack that left 50 people dead and 53 wounded, Trump responded by suggesting that President Obama is somehow helping ISIS carry out their attacks on our shores. He doesn t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands. It s one or the other,  Trump said.  And either one is unacceptable. We re led by a man who is a very   look, we re led by a man that either is, is not tough, not smart, or he s got something else in mind. And the something else in mind, you know, people can t believe it. People cannot   they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the ways he acts and can t even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There s something going on. It s inconceivable. But McCain, who is facing one of the toughest re-election campaigns of his political career, went even further than that. Barack Obama is directly responsible for it, because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al-Qaeda went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama s failures,  McCain said.After being given a chance to clarify his remarks, McCain repeated his claim. He pulled everybody out of Iraq, and I predicted at the time that ISIS would go unchecked, and there would be attacks on the United States of America. It s a matter of record, so he is directly responsible. Here s the audio via the Washington Post.Of course, Trump s campaign manager quickly tweeted what McCain said, most likely thinking they had found an ally for their own attacks against President Obama.John McCain: Obama is  directly responsible  for Orlando attack   The Washington Post https://t.co/hjh5ry2r3B  Corey Lewandowski (@CLewandowski_) June 16, 2016There are many problems with McCain s claims. First of all, the shooter is the one who is  directly responsible  for the mass killing. Second, President Obama followed the order signed by President George W. Bush in 2008 agreeing to pull all US military personnel out of Iraq in 2011 after several attempts to keep troops there were rejected by the Iraqi parliament.Therefore, not only is President Obama not responsible for withdrawing our military forces out of Iraq, ISIS wouldn t have been able to rise if President Bush has not pushed to invade Iraq in the first place. The war in Iraq destabilized the region, thus allowing a terrorist organization like ISIS to form to fill the power vacuum.After much criticism, McCain has been scrambling to spin his remarks ever since. I misspoke. I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama s national security decisions, not the President himself. As I have said, President Obama s decision to completely withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 led to the rise of ISIL. I and others have long warned that the failure of the President s policy to deny ISIL safe haven would allow the terrorist organization to inspire, plan, direct or conduct attacks on the United States and Europe as they have done in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino and now Orlando. Again, it is an established FACT that President Obama did not invade Iraq and did not sign the withdrawal order. Both of those actions occurred before he ever stepped foot in the White House.But McCain was given a chance to clarify his usage of  directly responsible  and said it again instead so it s hard to believe him when he claims to have  misspoke. Also, as a so-called  leader  of his party, one would think that John McCain would be able to at least try and persuade the Republican-controlled Congress to declare war on ISIS so that President Obama can wage a full war with full resources to fight terrorism. But so far, Republicans would rather criticize President Obama for not going to war against ISIS even though the Constitution clearly states that only Congress has the power to declare a war.Clearly, John McCain has served long enough in the Senate. It s time for a new senator from Arizona. Perhaps a real maverick who knows how to be respectful of their commander-in-chief and knows when to keep their mouth shut instead of spewing lies and false accusations.Featured Image: Gage Skidmore", WATCH: John McCain Twice Claims President Obama Is ‘Directly Responsible’ For Orlando Attack
"June 16, 2017","It is now possible for religious adoption agencies in Texas to reject LGBT+ parents from adopting children.The Daily Caller reports that Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill on Thursday allowing faith-based foster care and adoption agencies to deny LGBT parents. This law, HB 3859, effectively protects faith-based agencies from being sued for choosing not to place children with any sort of LGBT+ couples.First of all, why is religion even playing a role in adoption? Children need a loving home and if parents are able to provide it, why does it matter who they are or who they re with? LGBT+ parents are just as capable as heterosexual, cisgender couples.Democratic opponents of the bill pointed out that it s a redundant law but supposedly it s a  step further  in preventing a couple from suing a faith-based agency if they re rejected. They also believe that it may allow for the use of religion as a tool of discrimination against LGBT and non-Christian parents. Such an imbalance of rights not only could leave these children worse off than they are now, it opens the door to blatant discrimination against children and loving parents who might not share the same beliefs as some foster care providers,  Democratic State Sen. Kirk Watson said when the bill was brought before the state Senate. Of course, it s going to be used as a tool of discrimination! Why else was this bill written up? Certainly not for the welfare of the children.According to The Daily Caller, the author of the bill State Rep. James Frank, claims it would not only defend the rights of religious agencies but also help solve the housing crisis that plagues the foster and adoption systems.Republicans argue it s necessary to prevent the loss of faith-based agencies where some have already ceased operations due to the risk of being sued for operating according to their religious beliefs.You think?Again, I ask, why is religion even involved in the foster care system? It s an outrage and it s disgusting. It s another tarnish to the Christian faith.Featured image via Rodger Mallison/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNS via Getty Images", Christians Can Now Discriminate Against LGBT Parents Hoping To Adopt In Texas (DETAILS)

Awhile back, Trump said that Hillary had enabled her husband s adultery while he was president, as if that somehow makes her both less of a woman, and unqualified to be president. Trump doesn t go after anyone s policy positions the way a presidential candidate should. He attacks his opponents personally, like the schoolyard bully he is, and his fans are doing the same.That a father thinks it s okay teach his 10-year old how to be the same childish bully as Trump is just sick.But the worst is yet to come.

And it s no wonder, because he also wrote this in his recount of the event (if it can even be called an  event ): Sickened, I got in my car and watched in the rearview as a group of college boys tailgated out of their pickup  That s when I realized what had been there all along. This campaign, whose success has long been attributed to the forgotten working and middle classes, the so-called Silent Majority, has been, and always will be, an unholy alliance between the Hateful and the Privileged, the former always on a never-ending search for new venues for their poison and the latter enjoying, for the first time since Reagan s  80s, an opportunity to get out and step on some necks in public. Any reasonable person would find themselves sickened at a Trump rally if this is normal, and given what s happened to protesters, members of the press, and others, this is normal. It s clear that the only thing Donald Trump is truly capable of is bringing out the worst of humanity, which isn t surprising considering he himself embodies the worst of humanity.Featured image by Gerardo Mora/Getty Images"," This Man Reveals The Raw, Terrifying Truth About What REALLY Goes On At Trump Rallies (TWEETS)"
"June 17, 2017","The bright side of the Russian/Trump investigation, if you can find one, is that a lot of political stars are being born. Al Franken, while not a newbie to most, is separating himself from the chaff, as are Adam Schiff, Kamala Harris and a handful of other Democrats. One major rising star, though, isn t a Democrat at all   he s a former counter-intelligence officer. He considers himself a Colin Powell Republican and if he were to run for President, there s little doubt he d be a force to be reckoned with, regardless of party.After Friday night s Overtime with Bill Maher (the part of the show that s on YouTube instead of on TV), Nance confirmed his badass status when he stood up to Breitbart Editor in Chief, Alex Marlow, demanding an apology for a story that ran a few years ago that resulted in death threats to Nance and his family.On the subject of fake news, which Marlow tried to redefine as a liberal invention, Nance said this: There was this article about a 35-year counterterrorism expert who claimed they wanted Trump Tower attacked that was written in Breitbart,  Nance began.  I got 31 death threats and that came from your website you gonna apologize to me? Marlow responded that he respected Nance and his service to the country, but Nance shot back by saying,  Your followers threatened my family, my children, my wife. The Breitbart chief tried turning the tables.  Are you really suggesting that Breitbart doesn t get death threats? That our lives aren t put in danger? Marlow claimed he didn t remember the story, but if Nance would show it to him, he d apologize. Apparently, Marlow hasn t heard of the Google.Nance responded that he will  come to (his) office and see that retraction. Marlow then called Nance, who is incredibly calm,  hysterical,  which seems to be the go-to insult for anyone speaking out against the Trump administration.Here s the video:Featured image via video screenshots", Watch Malcolm Nance WIPE THE FLOOR With Breitbart Editor In Bill Maher’s Overtime
"June 18, 2016","Mike Hagan has a used car dealership and repair shop in Rochester, New Hampshire and is running a very odd and frankly irresponsible promotion. He s offering a free AR-15 to people who come buy a car from him, because  Murika.Hagan is a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan. He knows what these kinds of guns can do, and yet, according to WFTV 9, he s not worried about whether any of these guns might be used to murder people later on. Thus far, he s given away four of the weapons, along with a 9mm Beretta, which is an alternative for people who don t want an AR-15, and he thinks his promotion is a wild success.This kind of promotion is bad enough, and to refuse to end it following a horrific tragedy like Orlando is just plain insensitive and cruel. The gun nuts apparently don t see it that way, though. They ve taken to Facebook to celebrate Hagan s promotion, lest the  evil libruls  finally come to confiscate everyone s guns.              There has been some backlash, though, not just on social media, but also from a couple of people that NH1 TV spoke to. At least there are least still some sane people out there: To me that s just getting more of the nut jobs out there doing harm to more people that don t deserve it. My opinion, military and police are the only ones that should have them. Hagan has partnered with a local gun dealer to run his promotion, and customers have to go there to go through a background check and get the weapons. Apparently, that makes it all okay because it means he knows he can t give them out like they re candy.Besides that, he believes that the people who take advantage of this promotion will be fully responsible, because everyone knows that all the people who obtain their guns legally are very responsible gun owners   oh wait. Omar Mateen, and so many other mass shooters, bought their guns legally, not to mention all the idiots who have no clue what gun safety is, and end up accidentally shooting someone to death.Hagan claims he won t extend the offer to someone from whom he gets a bad feeling. So, what, he s telepathic and knows who has bad intentions? Horse hockey. This is still sick, it s still irresponsible, and it s still cruel and insensitive. It also demonstrates just how sick as a society we ve become where this kind of thing is seen as something to celebrate by so many.Featured image via screen capture from NH1-TV report", NH Car Dealer Gives Away Free AR-15s With Car Purchases – Gun Nuts Sickeningly Rejoice
"June 18, 2017","With the news dropping that supposedly Trump isn t under an investigation for obstruction of justice, we re all scratching our heads. Especially since Trump admitted he s under investigation himself.ABC This Week with George Stephanopoulos has an idea of what s going on. The President wants to take down Bob Mueller. His lawyer wants to take down Bob Muller and the question is why? And I think the answer is they wanna lay the foundation to discredit whatever Bob Mueller comes up with,  Stephanopoulos said in a video posted on Twitter.Given that Trump himself has admitted on Twitter that he is under investigation and that it s a  witch hunt , it sounds like a very plausible answer.Stephanopoulos goes on to say that  They re essentially engaging in a  scorched-earth  litigation strategy that is beginning with trying to discredit the prosecutor. He closes the video by saying that Mueller is just doing his job and is only just getting started, so we shouldn t just automatically dismiss Mueller or that Trump is being investigated.Stephanopoulos has a point. It does seem likely that Trump and his team would try to cover an investigation up. They don t want the public to know   it would damage his reputation (not that he has a glowing one in the first place).Why shouldn t we believe what Trump tweets? He knows what he s tweeting. Why shouldn t we believe the other sources?An excerpt of  This Week  shows Pierre Thomas, ABC News Senior Justice Correspondent saying  Now, my sources are telling me he s begun some preliminary planning. Plans to talk to some people in the administration. But he s not yet made that momentous decision to go for a full-scale investigation. If that s the case, it s possible that Mueller is backing off on the idea of investigating Trump. Why?Obviously, something is going on behind the scenes. Stephanopoulos may have just given us the real answer.Photo by Lorenzo Bevilaqua/ABC via Getty Images"," Trump Is Trying To Discredit Bob Mueller, And Here’s How"
"June 19, 2016","Wendy Bradshaw became a teacher because she wanted to help children learn and prepare them to succeed in life. Sadly, however, Bradshaw s Master Degree, with a focus on childhood behavioral disorders, could not have prepared her for the reality of today s classrooms.After being forced to make her students cry every day in class, Bradshaw resigned from Polk County schools last October.Her resignation letter goes straight to the heart of the problem with America s schools.She writes:The children don t only cry. Some misbehave so that they will be the  bad kid  not the  stupid kid , or because their little bodies just can t sit quietly anymore, or because they don t know the social rules of school and there is no time to teach them.The teacher s background in childhood behavior disorders helped her understand that these weren t  problem children . They were just normal children trapped inside a problematic system. While they may not have arrived at school with behavioral disorders, they were likely to leave with them.Bradshaw s letter goes on to explain:I can say with confidence that it is not the children who are disordered. The disorder is in the system which requires them to attempt curriculum and demonstrate behaviors far beyond what is appropriate for their age.This is what happens when lawmakers, not teachers and parents, get together to decide what s best for children whom they will never spend a single day with.It s also what happens when the power to educate is taken out of the hands of educators.Bradshaw writes:The disorder is in the system which bars teachers from differentiating instruction meaningfully, which threatens disciplinary action if they decide their students need a five minute break from a difficult concept, or to extend a lesson which is exceptionally engaging.She adds that:The disorder is in a system which has decided that students and teachers must be regimented to the minute and punished if they deviate. The disorder is in the system which values the scores on wildly inappropriate assessments more than teaching students in a meaningful and research based manner.All across the US, teachers and students are being subjected to this kind of strict regimine, which many, like Bradshaw, believe is doing more harm than good.Rather than improving student performance, student test scores are declining.As the Washington Post reported here in November:Fourth-graders and eighth-graders across the United States lost ground on national mathematics tests this year, the first declines in scores since the federal government began administering the exams in 1990.Reading performance also was sobering: Eighth-grade scores dropped, according to results released Wednesday, while fourth-grade performance was stagnant compared with 2013, the last time students took the test.Testing of students in 2013 also showed a decline from previous years.While some might be willing to support high-stakes testing if there were evidence that teaching to the tests was improving student performance, the opposite is true.Under No Child Left Behind, which ties teacher pay and school funding to student test results, kids and teachers are subjected to an enormous amount of pressure. The consequences of this failed experiment stretch beyond the academic, as Bradshaw s letter illustrates.All across the country, educators report  rising numbers of children struggling to manage their emotions in an academic environment.  The problems are most pronounced among the youngest students, teachers say.As Oregon Live reports here, in recent years  more students are coming to school unprepared or unsettled, which can lead to tantrums, running from the classroom, despondent behavior or physical aggression. As Bradshaw points out in her resignation letter, it is not the children who are disordered. It s the system.Photo by Bill O Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images ", Teacher’s Resignation Letter A Heartbreaking Reminder Of What We’re Doing To Kids
"June 19, 2017","There s a new Gallup poll out showing that Donald Trump can, in fact, make other people popular. However, the people this poll refers to aren t Republican lawmakers. They aren t conservative television personalities. They aren t people working in the White House. The people gaining popularity because of Donald Trump are Barack Obama and George W. Bush.Obama s popularity has remained fairly steady since the final months of his presidency, and it s considerably higher than Herr Trump s at 63 percent. Nearly every demographic has a highly favorable opinion of Obama, including all age groups, and both men and women. Republicans are the only group with which he doesn t poll well, but that s not shocking. They re still convinced he was secretly the Muslim Kenyan communist socialist anti-Christ that ruined America.Surprisingly, George W. s popularity has soared since Trump took office. He s currently sitting at 59 percent overall. Among Democrats, who are supposed to loathe W., his popularity has shot up a whopping 400 percent, to a 41 percent favorability rating.Just Democrats view W. more favorably than everyone views Trump. That s really embarrassing for a man who considers his poll numbers to be more important than terror attacks in London and seven dead sailors aboard the U.S.S. Fitzgerald.Furthermore, Republicans are worried that working for Trump will damage their reputations. Many Republicans have turned down job offers in the White House, and they re making it hard for Trump to fill key posts. While Trump yells about Democratic obstruction on nominees, he hasn t nominated anyone to fill a lot of those posts.Of course, the administration claims that everyone wants to work there, but what can you expect from someone to whom lying is second nature?Trump can crow about the Rasmussen poll all he likes, and trash President Obama all he likes. He s just making everything harder on himself with his inability to act like an adult.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images", New Poll: Trump Is Making Others More Popular – But They Aren’t Who You’d Think (DETAILS)

We all know Limbaugh is an idiot, but what he thinks about Harambe is so stupid it s astonishing, even for him.On his Tuesday show, he went off on a tangent when discussing Harambe, saying: A lot of people think that all of us used to be apes. Don t doubt me on this. A lot of people think that all of us used to be gorillas. And they re looking for the missing link out there. The evolution crowd. They think we were originally apes. I ve always   if we were the original apes, then how come Harambe is still an ape, and how come he didn t become one of us? That s Limbaugh playing anti-science creationist right there. He never says he s a creationist, but it s pretty clear from this (and other shows) that he is. Only young-earth creationists totally reject evolution this way. Now all he has to do is agree out loud that either the Earth is young, or that man has been on the planet for billions of years (which is impossible), and he can come out as the Christian zealot he is.Twitter had a field day with this, as people are wont to do over there when someone takes the stupid farther than rational beings thought was possible:it s not everyday somebody shows their complete ignorance of basic science but dammit @rushlimbaugh you did it again.

"June 2, 2017","Donald Trump s disastrous decision to take the United States out of the Paris climate deal was met with loads of criticism, as this will have devastating consequences for the entire planet.As several world leaders have already openly condemned Trump s decision, the backlash is about to get a whole lot worse once every finds out just what motivated Trump to reach this decision. According to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Trump made this decision based on one thing only, simplifying a complex matter to a kindergartener s level of reasoning: whether it was  good or bad.  Pruitt told reporters at a press briefing: The discussions that the president and I have had over the last several weeks have been focused on one key issue. Is Paris good or bad for this country? The President and I focused our attentions there. He determined it was bad for this country, and hurt us economically. It didn t achieve good environmental outcomes, and he made the decision to reject the Paris deal. We all knew Trump had the temperament of a child, but apparently, his decision-making process is just as bad. Trump has no idea what the hell he s doing, and so he looks to others to give him over-simplified answers to serious issues that will have a massive impact on our world. Such matters shouldn t require a yes/no, good/bad answer. They must be examined and carefully thought out   which Trump clearly has not taken the time to do.With this decision, Trump has solidified the fact that America will no longer be a global leader, as other countries shun the United States thanks to its incompetent, orange dictator. Trump has proven that the only thing he is capable of is ruining things. He s been extremely successful in devastating America, so now he is taking on the planet.You can watch the White House report on Trump s childlike decision-making process below:Featured image via Pool/Getty Images"," White House Admits How Trump Made Paris Deal Decision, It’s Really Disturbing (VIDEO)"
"June 20, 2016","When Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign he bragged that because was worth  $10 billion  he would not have to concern himself with raising money and could self-finance his campaign. Thanks to his weak competition in the Republican primary, Trump did not have to spend much to get an advantage over rival campaigns and Super PACs, but in the general election it is unlikely that Trump can get by simply based on tweets and bombast as he did with Bush, Cruz, and Rubio.On Monday night Trump filed his finance report with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the failure of his campaign to bring in money is nothing less than amazing.In May of 2016, Trump only raised $3.1 million from contributors and loaned his campaign an additional $2.2 million. At the end of the month the campaign only had a shocking $1.3 million dollars in cash on hand.As journalists quickly pointed out, Trump s fundraising more likely resembled a House member with  a semi-competitive seat  or  a safe Senate seat in a deep red state.  The numbers are definitely not the sort of figures associated with a national presidential campaign.The results look even worse compared to Hillary Clinton. At the end of May, her campaign had $42 million on hand, an amazing disparity of $40 million between the two campaigns.And while donors have said they are still unable to determine which Super PAC to donate to in order to support Trump, the Super PAC backing Clinton, Priorities USA, had its biggest month ever with $12 million in donations.Even compared to fellow Republicans, Trump s numbers are pathetic. In May of 2012, Mitt Romney s presidential campaign and the Republican Party raised $78 million dollars. The current GOP only raised $12 million this May.Defunct campaigns like Ben Carson s currently have $7.4 million on hand, more than Trump s active campaign.There are also some weird expenditures from the Trump campaign found in the FEC reports. He appears to be redirecting some money back towards himself.His campaign paid $423,371 for the use of Trump s own house the Mar-A-Lago mansion and club in Florida.Even stranger, Trump seems to be drawing a salary from his campaign, a very unusual arrangement especially for someone claiming to be a  billionaire.  The filings find that Trump is regularly being paid $2,574 as part of  payroll  for the campaign.Featured image via Flickr"," BOMBSHELL: Trump’s Presidential Campaign Is Nearly BROKE, It’s Going To Be A Bloodbath"

But we made huge gains, slashing wins in districts carried by 20+ points by Republicans down to single digits.

"June 21, 2016","Pastor Roger Jimenez made national news after the most recent mass shooting at a gay night club in Orlando when he decided to share what God thinks on the matter   specifically that more  sodomites  should be dead. Unfortunately for him, his god is a spiteful one who doesn t like people putting words in his mouth   or Jiminez is simply an intolerant person whom a civilized society will not tolerate. In any case, the good pastor just got some very, very bad news.After the shooting, Jimenez made some remarks that were horrifying even by right-wing  Christian  standards, explaining that the country shouldn t be mourning the death of 50 sodomites. People say, like:  Well, aren t you sad that 50 sodomites died?    Jimenez continued in his ravings.  Here s the problem with that. It s like the equivalent of asking me  what if you asked me:  Hey, are you sad that 50 pedophiles were killed today? Um, no, I think that s great. I think that helps society. You know, I think Orlando, Fla., is a little safer tonight,  he concluded, adding that he s upset more didn t die: The tragedy is that more of them didn t die. The tragedy is   I m kind of upset that he didn t finish the job! The remarks were universally condemned, even by some of the more extreme elements on the right who have not completely lost their sense of humanity. And now, Jimenez is looking for a new place to hold his hate group meetings church services. WMAZ reports that the property management company and owner of the building which Verity Baptist Church calls home will not be renewing Jimenez s lease:The property management company and owner of the building in which Verity Baptist Church and its Pastor Roger Jimenez preside have decided not to renew the church s lease, and have asked church officials to consider moving.Under the terms of the lease, Jimenez cannot simply be evicted, but the company says it can not tolerate tenants who advocate hatred and the taking of innocent lives. We have many places of worship and other religious organizations in the properties we manage,  company officials said in a press release.  Like all our tenants, their occupancy rights are protected in their leases. But, of course, that won t be an issue once the lease is up in March of 2017, and Jimenez and his hateful friends are told to put their boots to the pavement. If Jimenez leaves early, his lease will be canceled without any penalty. Just as we respect the right of individuals to speak their views, as distasteful as they may be, we also respect the right of others to protest as a reflection of their values,  the company says. For decades, the owners and staff at Harsch Investment Properties have supported the LGBT community and many other organizations whose missions are to further respect, dignity and the ability for all individuals to live their lives as they wish. Jimenez is an ideological clone of Tempe Arizona s Pastor Stephen Anderson, who also made some rather horrific remarks about the massacre. Anderson didn t even wait for the bodies to grow cold before he posted a gleeful and celebratory message on YouTube in which he said it was  good news  that 50  f*ggots    a group he, too, calls pedophiles without any evidence   died. At least these dangerous predators, these dangerous filthy pedophiles at this gay bar, at least they re off the streets,  Anderson, who leads Faithful Word Baptist Church, said.

"June 21, 2017","On Tuesday, Education Secretary Betsy Devos announced that she will appoint A. Wayne Johnson as the as Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid on Thursday. In the press release put out by the Education Department, Devos cited Johnson s academic and professional achievements as Johnson s skills he is bringing to the department.<FSA currently serves 42 million student loan borrowing clients and administers more than $1.4 trillion in current outstanding Federal Student Loan balances.Reuters reports on the story saying: In last year s election, Donald Trump and other Republicans campaigned on  getting government out of the business of student loans.  Democrats want to stay on the path forged by former President Barack Obama, who moved student lending from the banks to the federal government.DeVos has taken on higher-education finances since being confirmed in February. She recently began rewriting rules on for-profit college debt and decided to put one company in charge of servicing loans. Wayne is the right person to modernize FSA for the 21st Century,  said Secretary DeVos in a press release.  He actually wrote the book on student loan debt and will bring a unique combination of CEO-level operating skills and an in-depth understanding of the needs and issues associated with student loan borrowers and their families. Wayne has worked previously in executive positions at TSYS, First Data, and VISA. He is also the founder and former CEO of First Performance Corporation. Wayne s corporate background has attracted the ire of financial sector watch groups. Allied Progress, a left-leaning anti-Wall St watch group says that Wayne will implement  policies that increase the odds students will default on their loans. This announcement comes just one month after Obama-appointed FSA CEO, James Runcie, resigned from his position as Education Secretary. When he resigned Runcie cited he could not take  the risk  of working in a department ran by Devos. Runcie also claimed that he could not accept Devos  policies that were redirecting critical funds within the department. I cannot in good conscience continue to be accountable as Chief Operating Officer given the risk associated with the current environment at the [Education] Department,  reads the resignation memo Runcie put out in May.This move is a continuation of the corporatization of the federal government that has been seen under the Trump administration. Devos herself has no actual background in education. Yet, she is Education Secretary because she allowed Trump to use her family s arena multiple times, for free, during both his primary and presidential election. The Devos family is also deeply embedded in conservative politics, usually of the Christian fascist variety. They are major donors to the GOP s war chest as well, having given up to a commonly cited total of $200 million dollars to the Republican Party.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images", Betsy Devos Just Put A For-Profit Credit Card Exec In Charge Of Federal Student Aid Program

Those non-existent links were later used as a pretext for Rumsfeld s then-boss, President George W. Bush, to invade Iraq in 2003.Rumsfeld joins former Vice President Dick Cheney in supporting Trump as stalwarts of the Bush administration. By comparison, Bush himself is not supporting Trump, nor are his father, former First Lady Barbara Bush, Trump s primary rival Governor Jeb Bush, or former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.Rumsfeld s tenure as Secretary of Defense was marred by a series of blunders and lies that lead directly to the deaths of thousands of American soldiers and Iraqis. He ridiculed requests before the war began for a larger invasion force, which led to resources being stretched to the breaking point when the bloody Iraqi insurgency rose up against the troops.Under Rumsfeld, the U.S. military set up a torture site at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison, a black mark on the American record that has been cited by hundreds of terrorists and their allies as a justification for aggression towards the west.Rumsfeld also oversaw the turnover of many key American military functions to private contractors, who often engaged in torture and abuse while being paid by taxpayers.In 2006, an unprecedented  General s revolt  of retired generals and admirals called for Rumsfeld to be fired from his position. President Bush defended Rumsfeld until Republicans lost control of the House and Senate in fall of 2006, after which his resignation was accepted.Donald Trump has promised that as president he would increase the American use of torture, including waterboarding, a reversal of policy from President Obama but a return to techniques favored by his latest supporter   Donald Rumsfeld.Featured image via YouTube"," He Got Thousands Of U.S. Soldiers Killed, And Now He Backs Trump (VIDEO)"

Trudeau was as suave as ever for the most part and tried hard to play down the fact that Donald Trump is a raving f*cking lunatic. However, when the conversation turned to Trump s tweets, he accidentally pointed out what an irresponsible child the current  President  actually is.Trudeau was asked if he has his phone set to notify him when Trump sends out a tweet, like many of us do. Without even trying, the Prime Minister s response made Trump look like a damn fool. There s no question that the way the President chooses to speak directly to people through social media is a new wrinkle in international diplomacy,  Trudeau replied. He explained that deciphering how serious to take any given tweet of Trump s is important so that Canada can respond  without reacting to a similar level. The interviewers continued to press Trudeau on the matter, asking him if he is  in bed, like the rest of us, looking at Twitter at night?  And that is when it came. He made Trump look like an absolute moron simply by doing his job and not being a Twitter-obsessed narcissist. No, I tend to focus on the things I need to do, on my job,  Trudeau said, causing the audience to burst into laughter. Realizing that he had just unintentionally wiped the floor with Trump, he added, If I get woken up at night, it better be for something more important than a tweet.

"June 23, 2016","Whenever big news happens in Washington, the nation (at least those in desperate need of entertainment) awaits the response of just one man: Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas). Gohmert almost never disappoints with the depth of his stupidity and he certainly didn t on Thursday, when he yelled at the Democratic Congresspeople who were conducting a sit-in in support of gun control.The sit-in lasted a bit over 24 hours, and it was in protest to the four failed attempts at gun control in the Senate and of Speaker Paul Ryan s (R-Wisconsin) refusal to even let a gun control measure get a debate or vote.Gohmert, who received more than $13,000 in contributions from the National Rifle Association, thought the Congresspeople were protesting the wrong thing. According to him, Islam is responsible for our country s mass shootings. We are talking about radical Islam!  Gohmert yelled, waving his finger at posters featuring photos of the victims of the recent mass shooting at an Orlando, Florida gay club.  Radical Islam killed these people! Gohmert was shouted down by Democrats chanting,  No fly, no gun!  and  Don t let terrorists have a gun! Source: Talking Points MemoSure, we can call our gun problem a terrorism problem. G-d knows it s terrifying Americans, but it s not a Muslim problem. The vast majority of mass shooters are white men without a political agenda.  As we learn more and more about the Orlando shooter, we are coming to realize that his association to terrorism is sketchy at best. Instead, it seems, he was a spurned self-hating gay man.If that s the case, that he is a self-loathing gay man and that s all the shooting was about, that indicates a societal problem   one which Gohmert, a man who seems to obsess over whether being gay is God s will   is at least partially responsible for. The bigger picture, though, is that all of our mass shootings, as a matter of fact, all of our nation s shootings period, have one thing in common and that s guns. In our current political climate, there isn t a chance in hell that people will give up all guns, but there s a chance, albeit a slim one, that maybe we could stop the sale of assault weapons to violent people. That s all Congress wants.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla at Getty Images.", Louie Gohmert Gets Completely Unhinged And Screams At Reps During Sit-In (VIDEO)
"June 23, 2017","If there is one thing going for the American people against Trump s assault on decency, liberties, and intelligence it s that he and his team are so incompetent that they can t even do the simplest things without humiliating themselves. An obvious example of that sheer stupidity comes at us from this pro-Trump ad, which he recently proudly posted to his Facebook page.Thanks to the crack team over at the White House, a simple spelling mistake turned Trump s coal fetish into a call to relax child labor laws. In boasting about his efforts to kill clean energy and bring back coal, he promised to  put our minors back to work. The word he was looking for was  miners.  Apparently, nobody at Trump s White House noticed the typo. It s been six hours and nobody has bothered to fix it, either.This would be a funny gaffe if it weren t so depressingly common. Trump has issued statements misspelling the names and titles of foreign leaders. Trump has misspelled words as simple and varied as  Denmark  (Denmakr),  honored  (honered),  among  (amoung), and  unprecedented  (unpresidented).A White House statement bragging about Betsy DeVos spelled  education  wrong. She s the Secretary of Education.The Library of Congress gift shop had to pull a poster honoring Trump s inauguration when people noticed it, too, had an ridiculously simple typo.No joke: Purchasable copy of Trump's Inauguration Print, direct from the Library of Congress site. A 5th grader would've spotted this typo. pic.twitter.com/zomWsMojYV  Jules Winnfield (@paulm4749) February 12, 2017Meanwhile, Trump s minor/miner gaffe has another unfortunate side effect for his administration   reminding us that his good friend Newt Gingrich actually wants to repeal child labor laws. As writer Parker Molloy points out, Newt, a full-time moron who moonlights as a part-time shithead on evenings and weekends, once called child labor laws  truly stupid  and suggested poor kids be encouraged to become janitors at their schools, picking up the trash of their classmates to earn lunch money.Speaking at the John F. Kennedy school, Gingrich said that children in the poorest neighborhoods are  trapped in child laws  that prevent them from earning money. Most of these schools ought to get rid of the unionized janitors, have one master janitor and pay local students to take care of the school,  Gingrich said according to a CNN video.Trump hasn t gone that far. He s only hinted that he would prefer children work. During Obama s administration when he was eager to pretend the unemployment rate was sky high he would sometimes count children as part of his inflated unemployment figures.Instead of worrying about coal miners and school-aged minors, Trump, who was born rich and stayed that way, might want to invest in some additional schooling for himself. Basic grammar and spelling would be a good place to start.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images", Colossal White House Screw Up Leads To Trump Endorsing Child Labor In New Ad (VIDEO)

"June 24, 2017","Donald Trump must be squirming in his tightie-whities as the investigation into his administration s collusion with Russia heats up because he just tweeted one of the absolute dumbest things he has said in quite a while   that the investigation should shift to President Obama because his administration uncovered Vladimir Putin s verified plot (complete with direct instructions) to install Trump in the Oval Office. Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action?  Trump tweeted on Saturday.  Focus on them, not T!

They didn't want to hurt Hillary?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2017It is true that the Obama administration was completely aware of what was going on. That s why the President expelled numerous suspected Russian spies who were aiding the operation from within our borders, considered harsh sanctions, and set up  the digital equivalent of bombs that could be detonated if the US found itself in an escalating exchange with Moscow  that would cripple Russia s economy. Unfortunately, President Obama left it up to Trump to push the button and he s only just getting around to admitting that Russia   not  someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds  was behind the interference in our election.Naturally, the fine folks on Twitter came to the rescue, attempting to save Trump from somehow growing a third foot for the express purpose of shoving it in his mouth with the other two by correcting him and mocking him in an effort to cause him to feel shame for the first time in his miserable life:Donald was informed of the Russian attack during his campaign and did nothing but ride the wave into the White House.#NiceTryTrump  val broeksmit (@BikiniRobotArmy) June 24, 2017You re an idiot.

"June 25, 2016","On May 31 the state of Arizona ran out of midazolam, a sedative which, when mixed with other drugs, can be used to carry out state-sponsored executions. Arizona officials later announced that the state had discontinued use of the drug altogether.This is good news for opponents of the death penalty. Thanks to their advocacy, the supply of midazolam has all but dried up in Arizona and elsewhere. Better still, Arizona is no longer able to obtain other drugs used in executions, such as pentobarbital and sodium thiopental.In a court filing this week, lawyers for the state basically admitted Arizona s hands are tied. According to the documents, Arizona is not able to execute inmates at this time, due to lack of access to various execution drugs.The last person to be executed in Arizona was Joseph Rudolph Wood. In 2014, Wood was given 15 doses of midazolam along with a pain killer. It took him two hours to die.Following the botched execution, attorney s from the public defender s office filed suit on behalf of Wood and other Arizona inmates. A coalition of media organizations joined in the suit, asking the court to compel the state to fully disclose how it handles executions.In a recent court filing, attorneys for the state of Arizona asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The state claims that the suit is now moot, citing the fact that it is no longer able to carry out executions, due to lack of access to lethal-injection drugs.As Addicting Info reported here, federal authorities busted Arizona officials smuggling illegal drugs into the U.S. in October of last year. Federal agents confiscated an illegal shipment of sodium thiopental at the Phoenix Airport, which Arizona officials spent more than $27,000 of taxpayer money to obtain from Asia.The states of Texas and Nebraska were also busted for smuggling illegal drugs into the country last year.With Arizona s recent decision to discontinue the use of midazolam, the state s lack of access to other death penalty drugs in the U.S., and the federal government blocking attempts to obtain the drugs from overseas, Arizona is officially out of options for killing people.Image credit: Wikimedia Commons", Arizona Is Out Of Death-Penalty Drug Options
"June 25, 2017","Donald Trump rode into the presidency with all the political savvy, intellectual curiosity and diplomatic skills of a bully who s about to repeat the 5th grade. For many of his supporters, many of whom presumably were bullies who had to repeat 5th grade, that s exactly his appeal. So why should it surprise anyone that Trump has managed to offend ally after ally while in office? That s what he was elected to do.Still, nothing in Trump s first 156 (and counting) days in office seems intentional. On some level, he seems to want to be a diplomat, if for no other reason than to have a legacy, but every single time he tries, he falls flat on his corpulent face.Just last week, for example, Trump sent his son-in-law, Jared Kushner to try to negotiate peace between Israel and Palestine. It went about as well as you d imagine. Kushner, who is Orthodox Jewish ad a family friend of Israel s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, and according to Palestinians, came armed only with a list of Israeli demands.Of course, Palestine was far from the first diplomatic blunder of the Trump administration. Here s a list of all the countries, most of whom are allies, that Trump has offended:Mexico almost didn t make this list because, well, Trump ran on a campaign of hatred for all things Mexican (except for the cheap labor that makes his cheap ties and suits). His first campaign promise was to build a wall along the Mexican border, but a feud between Trump and Mexico s President Enrique Pe a Nieto has turned into somewhat of a regular fixture in the Twitterspere.One of Trump s very first moves in office included a phone call to Australia s Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. After a heated discussion about Syrian refugees, Trump hung up on the world leader.Trump s entire schtick is about creating fear in the hearts and minds of his voters, so much so that he has been known to make up events just to convince people the world is a scary place. In February, he made up a terror attack in Sweden during a rally in Florida (yes, the man who won the Electoral College in November and who has innumerable better things to do is still holding campaign style rallies throughout the country). You look at what s happening in Germany. You look at what s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers, they re having problems like they never thought possibleNothing had happened the night before in Sweden.Donald Trump has a complicated relationship with smart, powerful women   especially if they aren t leggy, blonde and share his DNA. His relationship with Germany s chancellor, Angela Merkel began badly in March, when Trump famously refused to shake her hand. That was only the beginning. Read on for more.In April, Trump hosted the Chinese President Xi Jinping for dinner at Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. While the men were enjoying  the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you ve ever seen,  Trump revealed that he was lobbing missiles at Iraq Syria. While this wasn t really an insult, it did show President Xi that Trump couldn t be trusted to keep secrets. Before that, though, Trump often referred to China as a  currently manipulator  After he took office, Trump accepted a congratulatory call from Taiwan. This was a clear violation of U.S. foreign policy, Taiwan as part of China.If there is a single ally that nearly every Trump supporter can get behind, it s Israel. While Trump s relationship with Israel is not too bad, at least compared to much of the world, one of perhaps his biggest international blunders came when he traded Israeli secrets with Russians. Oh, and there was also the time Trump told Israelis, while in Israel, that he  just got back from the Middle East.  Israel, of course, is in the Middle East.Trump shoved the Prime Minister so he could get to the front of a photo op.Not satisfied with offending just one country at a time, Trump took on all the European allies by calling them NATO deadbeats. He singled out Germany by calling them  bad, very bad,  because Americans love to buy their cars. He insulted Europe in general by telling them that it s too hard to build golf courses there.For Trump, offending our neighbor to the south isn t enough. He s had a long-running feud with Canada s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is Trump s political superior in nearly every way imaginable. In May, Trump referred to Trudeau as  Justin from Canada.

Well, not England as a whole   its capital, London. Trump has been irrationally critical of London Mayor Sadiq Khan s handling of terror attacks in London. Khan responded by asking that Trump s upcoming state visit be cancelled.Donald Trump s retreat from the Paris Climate Accord was perhaps his most offensive diplomatic move to date. There are only two countries that did not sign on to the agreement: Syria and Nicaragua. The First because they are in the middle of a civil war and the second because the agreement doesn t go far enough. Trump did it to appease his climate denier base. The world will be a dirtier place because of it.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images", Here Is A Comprehensive And Up To Date List Of All The Allies Trump Has Offended
"June 26, 2016","Margaret Sawyer was shocked when she encountered a blatantly racist  swim safe  poster at a public swimming pool in Salida, Colorado.Titled Be Cool, Follow The Rules, the poster, produced by the Red Cross, shows Black and white children engaged in various activities around a public swimming pool.Arrows pointing to the children are accompanied by the words  Cool,  or  Not Cool. As you can see from the image below, all of the dark-skinned children are misbehaving in the picture. The labels placed on these kids read  Not Cool. In contrast, the white boys and girls are shown doing something acceptable. These kids are labelled  Cool. Image credit: John Sawyer via TwitterAfter seeing the poster, Sawyer says she reported her concerns to the lifeguard on duty. She also followed up by writing a letter to the management of the facility.She assumed that would be the end of it. At the time she, she says, she believed that the poster was printed years ago and just never taken down.When she and her family visited another Colorado pool, this time in Fort Morgan, Sawyer was shocked to find the exact same poster on display there. She again reported it to management.She also took a photo, uploading it to social media.The public backlash that followed prompted a quick response from the Red Cross:The American Red Cross appreciates and is sensitive to the concerns raised regarding one of the water safety posters we produced. We deeply apologize for any misunderstanding, as it was absolutely not our intent to offend anyone. As one of the nation s oldest and largest humanitarian organizations, we are committed to diversity and inclusion in all that we do, every day.The organization went on to say: Going forward, we are developing more appropriate materials that are more representative of our workforce and the communities we serve. The Red Cross says it has removed the poster from its website and notified its aquatic partner facilities to take it down.Sawyer, a mother of two, says the apology isn t enough. She is calling on the Red Cross to partner with organizations like Black Kids Swim, as well as groups that advocate for people of color.Sawyer is also calling on the public to write letters expressing their concerns to the American Red Cross.During an interview with NBC, Sawyer said:I think it s really important to think about the messages that we re sending kids.

"June 26, 2017","For the years since the debate over the Affordable Care Act began, anti-government Republicans (is there another kind?) have been bitching about the individual mandate that required people to buy insurance.Now it s their turn to come up with an alternative, and while theirs will cover fewer people, their solution is to force everyone to buy it, regardless of whether they can afford the barely subsidized coverage.The addition, which was tacked onto the Republican healthcare bill on Monday, is somewhat different from the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which says that there would be a penalty for people who lack coverage for more than 63 days. In the GOP bill, it s even worse. People would be barred from coverage at all for six months if they have a 63 day gap.Republicans added this provision after economists and health policy experts convinced them that it would be unsustainable to not force people to purchase insurance.Health policy experts across the political spectrum had warned that the initial Senate bill s failure to include some penalty for going uninsured could cause a  death spiral  in which people go without health insurance while healthy and only buy it when they become sick. In that scenario, insurance premiums shoot up for everyone as insurance markets become flooded with customers who disproportionately require expensive treatments.Source: NBC NewsThe main difference between this and the Affordable Care Act, though, is that the cost of premiums are going to be much higher. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 22 million Americans stand to lose their healthcare coverage if the GOP bill becomes law.By and large, Republicans want to do away with the Medicaid expansion, which allowed poorer people access to insurance, often without paying anything. Everyone who makes under $48,000 a year receives subsidies to help pay for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Instead with Trumpcare, they want to offer those people a block grant, which would severely restrict medical spending. Instead of subsidies, there will be tax credits.Some who aren t receiving Medicaid or Medicare might see more affordable premiums, but that s only because the coverage will be so much less.Republicans have now chosen to take the most controversial portion of the Affordable Care Act and make it absolutely draconian. If you happen to be one of the 22 million who loses insurance, good luck getting it back.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Republicans Just Added What They Hated The Most About Obamacare To Their Bill
"June 27, 2016"," LGBT Crowd Eyes Preschool Children.  That s the vile headline on a story republished on Fox News from capital bigot Laura Ingraham s site, Lifezette. The headline was crafted specifically to make people recoil in horror due to the misbegotten idea that the LGBT community is all about pushing the  homosexual agenda  onto our children. Below is a screen capture of the story sitting on Fox News  website, for all to see:The story itself almost waxes poetic on the dangers of LGBT indoctrination, attacking a series of online videos called  Queer Kids Stuff.  That series intended to help parents talk to their children about the LGBT community in a way that s easy for them to understand. Bigoted, homophobic conservatives, however, see this as predatory, claiming that the only way the movement wins is by going after ever-younger groups of children.The videos haven t made their way into preschools yet, but that s exactly what Sean Ryan, the communications director of Mass Resistance, an alleged  pro-family  group, is afraid of: It is easily conceivable that videos such as these will be sanctioned eventually by local school boards and implemented in preschool and prekindergarten classes.Activists are trying to force these topics on younger and younger children because that is the only way their movement wins.Rational adults don t buy into the so-called  Queer Theory  or transgenderism. Unfortunately, children are a soft target for homosexual activists as they are malleable and still learning about the world. We have to wonder who these rational adults are, and whether he even knows the definition of  rational,  since he clearly isn t. Chances are he means narrow-minded, extremist fanatics like himself, who think that the LGBT community needs to go back into the closet and stay there, so we can all go back to pretending they don t exist, like we used to. Ryan even alluded to that in the story: There was once a time when it was unthinkable to even mention the topic of homosexuality in a school setting. Now, there are homosexual, bisexual [and] transgender lesson plans for kids as young as kindergarten. He believes that the reason today s parents might support something he views as gross is because they, themselves, were indoctrinated and don t even realize it. There s no way of convincing someone this close-minded and black-hearted that nobody was brainwashed, except, perhaps, them.The New Civil Rights Movement said that Fox News should change the headline. They should, but they won t, because it says exactly what they want to say.  It s all about the children, we swear!  the haters scream. It s not, and saying that the LGBT community is after our children is a dangerous lie and a half.Featured image by Scott Olson/Getty Images and Fox News website", Fox News Attacks LGBT Community With Disgusting Story Saying They’re After Young Children
"June 27, 2017","According to a new report, health insurance premiums will shoot up 74% for the Average American under the health care bill being served up by the Republican Senate. Older customers will be hit even harder with some paying twice as much for plans comparable to what they currently have.The nonpartisan group Kaiser Family Foundation analyzed the costs for individual market plans that cover 70% of medical costs   what most Obamacare plans cover   and factored in insurance prices and subsidies under the Republican bill.Mitch McConnel s health bill encourages customers to purchase plans with high deductibles, reduces subsidies for lower-income Americas, and allows insurers to charge older people more.These changes would result in plans varying dramatically due to age and income, with low-income and older persons suffering the most.People between 55 and 64 would see an increase of 115$ on average, which is more than double the Obama care prices. Low-income Americans who make less than $24,000 a year would receive an increase of 177$, versus only 57% for people that bring in more money.Younger and higher income Americans will see less sweeping changes in their insurance premiums.Customers who have the disadvantage of being bother older and low-income will see premiums go up 294%, an increase of almost fourfold.The Senior Vice President for Special Initiatives at Kaiser Family Foundation, Larry Levitt, weighed in on the drastic situation. Faced with premiums almost quadrupling, many of these low-income adults would tend to either go without coverage entirely because it s unaffordable or gravitate towards a plan with lower premiums and higher deductibles. The Congressional Budget Office even admits this bill is going to be disastrous for Americans. Their own analysis concluded that premiums will most likely be too high for low-income Americans to purchase coverage, causing millions more to be stranded without insurance than under the current health care law.Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images", Brace Yourself For 74 Percent Higher Health Care Premiums Under New Bill
"June 28, 2016","The GOP convention is drawing all sorts, including nutbags like this one on YouTube. It s also drawing those who believe the GOP s policies are a major departure from what this country was supposed to be, despite all their claims that they want us to be exactly that. Because of that, the Freedom From Religion Foundation has a billboard up near their venue with a quote from none other than St. Reagan himself, and conservatives will absolutely despise it.This is the billboard below:FFRF quotes Reagan in Cleveland message to GOP convention  https://t.co/MIkpBehtQv pic.twitter.com/6EGURARKW7  FFRF (@FFRF) June 27, 2016The point is clear: Keep church and state separate.Over the last couple of decades, Republicans have worked hard to entangle civil law with biblical law, and they hope to keep us from knowing the difference. Pea-brains like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, James Inhofe, and more allow their religions to have a stranglehold on their policy decisions. The GOP itself has taken the Establishment Clause to mean that Christians should be free to do whatever they want to whomever they want, but all other religions need to put up with being restricted, and shut up altogether.The FFRF has been working to keep church and state separate since 1978, and this billboard is a brilliant idea because it takes a quote from one of the GOP s own idols and turns it back on them. Some places, like The Blaze, have already claimed that the quote is taken out of context, which is nonsense. The full quote is: Our very unity has been strengthened by our pluralism. We establish no religion in this country, we command no worship, we mandate no belief, nor will we ever. Church and state are, and must remain, separate. All are free to believe or not believe, all are free to practice a faith or not, and those who believe are free, and should be free, to speak of and act on their belief. That s in no way taken out of context. Instead, it s basically a summary of what Reagan was saying. Furthermore, Reagan s own son, Ron Reagan Jr., is on the Honorary Board of Distinguished Thinkers at the FFRF, and is an atheist who isn t afraid to burn in hell. There s little question he supports this display.It s actually the hateful, judgmental, narrow-minded  Christians  of the religious right who don t want to follow the Constitution, and they re dragging the GOP along with them, all in the name of  following the Constitution.  It s long past time for the GOP to stop pandering to the evangelicals and actually try to govern according to the Constitution, like they keep insisting they are.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images"," Billboard With Reagan Quote Stands Outside GOP Convention, And Conservatives REALLY Won’t Like It"

"June 29, 2016","President Obama, due to his unique position, is able to use the global stage to draw attention to issues unlike any other leader   foreign or domestic. On Wednesday, speaking at a joint summit with the Prime Minister of Canada and the President of Mexico, the topic of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump came up.In the course of discussing Trump s foot-stamping about economic issues, the President took a second to dissect the media narrative that has described Trump as a  populist  for months on end.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdIiAO5Pdo Somebody   who has never shown any regard for workers, has never fought on behalf of social justice issues or making sure that poor kids are getting a decent shot at life or have health care,  does not meet the definition, Obama said. They don t suddenly become a populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes. That s not the measure of populism. That s nativism, or xenophobia. Or worse. Or it s just cynicism,  he said.The media has used the reaction of white, blue collar audiences to Trump as evidence that he is a populist speaking to the masses. But the reality TV star is not a man of the people. He has actually made a lot of his money swindling some of those same sorts of people with his fraudulent enterprises like Trump University.As President Obama made clear in just a few seconds, Trump is simply posturing as if he were a populist, but a short glance at his language and his habit of practicing demagoguery destroys his posturing pretty quickly.Trump launched his campaign attacking Latinos as criminals and rapists, he has blamed all immigrants   especially Muslims   for terrorism, and he has also denigrated blacks and women throughout his career.A populist stands up for the little guy, he doesn t turn him upside down and try to suck the money out of his pockets.Featured image via YouTube"," Obama Exposes Trump For The World To See, And It Only Took A Few Seconds (VIDEO)"

"June 3, 2016","When you think of anti-Trump people, South Carolina s governor, Nikki Haley, is probably not the first person to come to mind. Haley is anti-government, anti-choice, anti-civil rights and anti-regulation. In other words, she is the perfect Republican, but she s no fan of Donald Trump.In the past, Haley has said that Trump  has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk.  Sure, that s not exactly an endorsement, but then, she certainly seemed to leave other options open.On Thursday, though, Haley minced no words whatsoever. She compared Trump to Dylann Roof, who is accused of killing nine black churchgoers in what was clearly a racist attack. These comments are possibly worse than any of his opponents have dared levy against him:South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said Thursday she wishes Donald Trump communicated differently because bad things result from divisive rhetoric, as evidenced by last June s massacre in Charleston.The Republican governor said divisive speech motivated Dylann Roof to gun down nine black parishioners at historic Emanuel AME Church. Police have said the white 22-year-old charged with their killings wanted to start a race war.The Confederate flag that Roof was seen brandishing in photos had to be removed from the Statehouse grounds, she said, and she supports sending the rebel flag in The Citadel s chapel to a museum too. But she opposes renaming buildings or monuments associated with the state s racist past.Haley, who endorsed then-candidate Marco Rubio ahead of South Carolina s primary, said she has vocally criticized Trump because  I know what that rhetoric can do. I saw it happen. Source: Crooks and LiarsHere is the video:Haley is right. Since Trump began running for president, hate crimes against Muslims have escalated. He inspired at least one hate crime against a Latino man. Trump is certainly winning with the white supremacist voting bloc.None of this is exactly new and in fact, Trump may be more of a symptom than a cause. According to the Southern Policy Law Center, extremist groups have been growing, and that started before Trump announced his run for the presidency.The timing doesn t excuse Trump from blame, though. Like any good marketing person (and we have to admit that Trump is that, if nothing else), Trump saw the insidious trend and ran with it. It didn t hurt his cause that he was already very comfortable with racist, xenophobic rhetoric. It didn t hurt his cause that he s probably sincere in his hatred, but as the SPLC notes, it s the job of our leaders to act like adults. After seeing the bloodshed that defined 2015, our politicians should have worked to defuse this anger and bring us together as a nation,  Mark Potok, editor of the report, wrote.  Unfortunately, the carnage did little to dissuade some political figures from spouting incendiary rhetoric about minorities. In fact, they frequently exploited the anger and polarization across the country for political gain. Source: PS MagThat is the most dangerous kind of cynicism. It s clear that Trump doesn t care if a civil war breaks out. Hell, he d be cheering people on. Trump has one goal and only one goal, and that is to become Dictator in Chief.

"June 3, 2017","Here s a new low for America: During the unfolding tragedy in England, NBC announced that it would not be displaying the messages of Donald Trump, the President of the United States, because his tweets were spreading potential lies.Pres. Trump has used Twitter to share news report on London incident.We aren't relaying president's retweet, as the info is unconfirmed.  NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) June 3, 2017Trump decided the minutes after a possible terror incident in London would be a good time to retweet fear-mongering speculation from the right-wing conspiracy site Drudge Report. His action may have done one of two equally disgusting things: He either amplified the terror being spread by a terror attack (thereby doing the work of the terrorist) or he spread misinformation and rumors thereby needlessly scaring people because of his eagerness to exploit a tragedy.Either way, people were appalled.But Trump wasn t done.Rather than wait for the facts to come in, Trump immediately seized on the moment to renew his push for a Muslim ban in the United States. British officials hadn t even confirmed the number of dead and wounded, and Trump was busy using the tragedy to promote his own bigoted policies an ocean away. It would take him three tweets before he got around to expressing concern for the victims.Trump has been increasingly relying on unreliable right-wing conspiracy sites to get his information. As president, he regularly receives extremely detailed information about world events from experts in the intelligence community, but his animosity towards the officials in the FBI and CIA, and his general dislike of reading makes him often ignore the valuable intel. Instead, he chooses to get his information from Drudge, Fox News, and InfoWars. The right-wing media sites are notoriously unscrupulous. InfoWars, for example, endorsed the theory that the Sandy Hook school shooting was staged by Obama as a pretext to taking people s guns. Drudge routinely gets facts wrong in its rush to promote fear and intolerance in its extremely right-wing audience.Two hours later, Trump finally deleted the Drudge Report tweet   which puts him in an awkward position because it technically violates federal law to do so. His advisers might want to tell him that the best way to avoid that is by not spreading Drudge Report tweets in the first place.Briefed by top National Security officials in the nation.Retweets Drudge.UnRetweets it.Unpresidented. pic.twitter.com/LhKqmD0zn2  Karen DaltonBeninato (@kbeninato) June 3, 2017Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Trump Immediately Politicizes London Tragedy On Twitter In A New Low Even For Him
"June 30, 2016","We all know that Trump supporters are crazy, but a man in New York City s Times Square took it to a whole other level on Thursday. The clearly disturbed man is NYC s 21-year-old Krit McClean. He was reportedly shouting about Donald Trump at the top of a ledge, and was completely naked. Authorities and bystanders stared as he blew kisses at the crowd that stopped to watch the show, and was shouting, Donald Trump where are you! It all started when McClean took to the Square early Thursday morning, stripped naked in front of a Disney Store near 46th street, removed the watch from his wrist, hurled it at a nearby woman, and began shouting incoherently. A security guard told McClean to get dressed, but the order was ignored. He also was combative when police arrived, shouting Get that bitch Debbie, I want to talk to Debbie!  After that, McClean said he needed to meet with Trump.Then, McClean was atop a 16 foot ledge shouting,  Donald Trump where are you, Donald Trump where the f  are you?!  Officers on the scene report that he was grabbing and waving his private parts at them, did some sort of dance, and then jumped from the ledge, but unfortunately missed the safety apparatus that first responders had down below for him, and hit the pavement instead. He was carted off to Bellevue, a psychiatric institution in New York City, and is reportedly in stable condition.Now, this man is clearly mentally ill, but I find it very telling that he appears to be obsessed with Donald Trump, even in the middle of some kind of psychotic break.

According to a source speaking with Morrongiello, a panicking Trump marched around the West Wing asking people to reassure him about his tweets. Heaven knows what they said. It s hard to sugarcoat something like this. His tweets were widely condemned by both Republicans and Democrats who recognized that the attack was clearly sexist in nature and  beneath the dignity of the office. It seems likely that Trump s staff reassured him that he was right to say those things, even while privately conceding their boss is nuts. According to sources speaking with the Daily Beast, White House staff are on the verge of mental breakdowns over Trump s behavior, which they are unable to stop:Senior aides to the president have tried and failed for months to find new ways to distract the president from cable-news and social media and bring some level of control to his tweets. On Thursday they responded to the tweetstorm with a mix of resignation and gallows humor.Is Morrongiello s source legit? It seems probable. Trump has been known to crowdsource opinions about his job performance before. Early in his term, leaked audio captured Trump asking guests at Mar-a-Lago for advice on who should be in his cabinet.Trump often appears to want to include his friends in the decision-making process.Turning to a longtime club member that night, he said:  We were just talking about who we [are] going to pick for the FCC, who [are] we going to pick for this, who we gonna accept   boy, can you give me some recommendations? Trump has not apologized to Mika or the nation for his behavior yesterday. Instead, he sent out his best liars   Sarah Huckabee and Kellyanne Conway   to defend his use of personal attacks and lies to hurt his critics. They did so without blinking.At the White House press briefing, reporters asked Huckabee if Trump will apologize   she ignored the question.

"June 4, 2016","Beebe, Arkansas mayor, Mike Robertson, loves Jesus. He loves Jesus so much that he s using public dollars to fund a gospel band for Beebe s 4th of July celebration, and he knows what he s doing, too. Otherwise, he wouldn t have said this in his letter urging residents to come out: I am pleased to announce that this year s live music will be provided by Grammy-Nominated, Multiple Award-Winning Gospel Artists, The Bowling Family The Bowling Family combines talent, sincerity and experience to create a memorable concert experience. Their goal for the evening is to usher in the presence of god and to celebrate the Christian message. They feel privileged and honored to enjoy the freedom to honor Christ with any and all of their abilities.  [emphasis mine]You can read the letter in its entirety here.It s ironic that he d knowingly pick a gospel band to help his town celebrate a day on which our founders declared their independence from the British Crown, and sought things like religious freedom for the colonies. It s sad, too; Robertson clearly practices the religious right s warped and twisted view of American history.David Niose, the legal director of the American Humanist Association, sent a stern letter of warning to Robertson s office, saying that a concerned citizen had contacted him about usurping our Independence Day, along with public dollars, to endorse a religion not everyone in Beebe practices. The American Humanist Association has successfully sued other government entities for promoting religion in the past, and Niose makes a point of mentioning that. He also said: You should not be surprised that some of your constituents object to your use of the apparatus of government, which of course is funded by citizens of various religious backgrounds, to endorse and promote your personal religion. Indeed, Beebe was also the center of controversy in 2014 when a family there opened a small, pagan temple in their garage. Robertson was initially behind that, thinking it was a little Christian church, but when he found out it was pagan, he changed his mind and claimed that zoning laws forbade a place of worship on that property.In fact, zoning laws actually allowed it. Robertson just doesn t like the idea that there are people in his town that practice a different religion than he does. Worse, he believes that public officials should be praying to his god  as the true leader of the nation.  This is Christian zealotry at its finest. Freedom for Christianity and Christians, but not for anyone else.Roberston told OneNewsNow that the city is acting fairly, and he s prepared to defend having this gospel group at their 4th of July event: We ve had all different types of entertainment. And we try each year to change it to do something for everybody s desire and liking, and so we chose a gospel group. He went on to say that people could just stay home if they don t like it. Wow.

"June 4, 2017","Trump s popularity continues to slip and slide downhill, including with his base. Every segment of his base, even those that are traditionally Republican. One demographic hasn t voted for a Democrat since 2000, but that could change in 2020 as they find themselves increasingly dissatisfied. A new Gallup poll shows that the military community, which Trump won by 17 points last year, now disapproves of him 52 percent to 43 percent. That s a 9-point difference there.In other words, according to Gallup who conducted the poll that s a 16-point swing away from how they saw him during his first 100 days. Prior to April 29, Trump still had a 7-point advantage with the military. May could be an outlier, or it could be the harbinger of a trend that should scare the hell out of Republicans.Military members and their families tend to lean conservative (even though it s primarily the Republicans who toss them aside when they come back from war, saying,  We don t have enough money for the VA. Too bad, so sad ). They re less diverse than the general population, and are less educated than the general public. They also tend to be more religious and more culturally conservative than civilians, so in short, their makeup looks very Republican.That makes this poll surprising and possibly damaging for the GOP, particularly with a contentious midterm coming up next year and a standard-bearer that can t crawl out of the hole of record disapproval in which he finds himself. He s certainly not winning anyone over with his proposal to close more military bases, which military communities tend to depend on for their own livelihood. The Russia scandal and his missteps, like firing James Comey and antagonizing our intelligence services, probably aren t helping either.This falling approval among the military community can present an opportunity for Democrats to slide in if they find solid ways to reach them. The truth is that they still have a significant disadvantage there, but disapproval for a president can translate to disapproval for his party. That, in turn, can lead to some conservatives deciding to vote Democratic.If this trend continues among the military community, then the GOP will probably find itself in some trouble. They rely on this part of their base. Now that part of their base is weakening.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images", Trump Won This Typically Republican Demographic By Double Digits – Now They’re Turning On Him
"June 5, 2016","In an unprecedented and unconstitutional move, New York s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has issued an executive order creating a blacklist of businesses in the state that are involved in the BDS movement against Israel. BDS stands for boycott, divest and sanction, and is a major way of protesting Israel s illegal actions in Palestine.The order actually tells state officials to compile a list of businesses involved in the BDS movement so Cuomo can order the State of New York to boycott them. As Baher Azmy, of the Center for Constitutional Rights, put it, this is 21st century McCarthyism, and it s vile.Speaking at the exclusive Harvard Club, Cuomo had the gall to say: If you boycott against Israel, New York will boycott you. If you divert revenues from Israel, New York will divert revenues from you. If you sanction Israel, New York will sanction you. Citizens United pretty much gave businesses First Amendment rights, and this violates those rights. Cuomo is using government power to coerce   even force   businesses into supporting Israel whether they want to or not. He called BDS an  economic attack on Israel  that must be stopped.While various states have bills in their legislatures that would likewise sanction businesses involved with the BDS movement, Cuomo s executive order gives him immediate power to take care of these businesses with a list that will be made public once it s finished. He even said that passing legislation can often be tedious, as though that s justification enough for issuing an order like this.Omar Barghouti, a founder of the BDS movement, said this isn t surprising and explained what Israel is busy doing: Having lost many battles for hearts and minds at the grass-roots level, Israel has adopted since 2014 a new strategy to criminalize support for B.D.S. from the top,  he said in an email, adding that such actions were meant to  shield Israel from accountability.' Israel will live by the sword for as long as it can; it will occupy all of the land for as long as it can, and it s afraid its time will draw to a close sooner rather than later if the U.S. officially condemns their actions in Palestine. As such, they re brainwashing us.Alphonso David, Cuomo s general counsel, said that this order specifies the BDS movement, but would target any boycott aimed at Israel. He also said it s meant to send a message about the BDS movement: Mr. David said in an interview that the executive action was meant to send a clear message that  the B.D.S. movement is deplorable.  He added that the governor s order was not meant to be interpreted as  opining on actions taken to empower Palestinians,  or meant to discourage debate over Israeli actions in the Middle East. Rather, it intends to stake a position on a movement that  the State of New York unequivocally rejects,  as the order puts it. The State of New York can reject whatever it wants. It can issue a statement to that effect. It should not be allowed to trample the 1st Amendment rights of anybody for any reason, especially to protect a country guilty of heinous atrocities.Constitutional rights are inalienable, unless you use them to protest Israel.Featured image by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images"," NY Gov.

Trump had made headlines the world over when he quickly jumped on the tragedy in London to push for his Muslim ban, scare people, and repeatedly smear the Mayor of London (who, it s no coincidence, happens to be Muslim).At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ""no reason to be alarmed!""

The London Mayor has been praised both in England and across the globe for his measured and competent response to the attacks on his city.On Monday, Trump s chief flack Sarah Huckabee claimed Trump had not taken Khan s remarks out of context despite that being exactly what had happened. No apology was issued.Due to this and Trump s other unhinged ranting about London, Mayor Khan said it was time for the British government to stand up to this behavior.Appearing on Channel 4 News on Monday evening, Khan said Trump was wrong about  many things  and that his state visit should not go ahead. I don t think we should roll out the red carpet to the president of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for,  he said. When you have a special relationship it is no different from when you have got a close mate. You stand with them in times of adversity but you call them out when they are wrong. There are many things about which Donald Trump is wrong. One of the ways Trump is  wrong  is in his use of a terror attack in London to promote his Muslim ban. Foreign policy experts have repeatedly warned that barring Muslims from immigrating or visiting the United States is not only unethical and unconstitutional, but it actually hurts the military s ability to combat terrorism at home and abroad.Conservative British Prime Minister Theresa May seemed to suggest Trump was out of line in attacking London s mayor. (She stopped short of naming Trump personally, which has infuriated many in the country.) You just praised the work that Sadiq Khan has been doing as mayor,  another reporter asked.  Donald Trump responded to the attack by mocking Sadiq Khan. Would a period of silence on his part now be welcome? As I ve said, I m very clear that   I m very clear that Sadiq is doing a good job as mayor of London,  she said before moving on.England by-and-large hates Trump. In one recent poll, just 18 percent of the British public said they approved of Trump. In parliament, in yet another first, the country s top politicians held a debate to argue whether Trump should be barred entry into the UK entirely due to his well-documented bigoted views. The vote eventually went in favor of letting him come, but even many conservative politicians admitted it was mostly because banning the sitting president of the United States would be a bad diplomatic move.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images", London Mayor Demands UK Cancel Trump’s State Visit After His Deranged Post-Attack Meltdown

Media outlets need advertising dollars to function, so the fact that Buzzfeed would give up any ad money at all, just to stand on principle, says a lot about how awful Trump really is. The RNC has to be smarting from that.Their response to this is as weak and watery as their reluctant decision to accept Trump as their nominee and standard-bearer. According to CNN, the RNC s chief strategist and spokesman, Sean Spicer, said: Space was reserved on many platforms, but we never intended to use BuzzFeed. It is ironic that they have not ruled out taking money from a candidate currently under investigation by the FBI. Excuses, excuses. It s like they re back in kindergarten and saying,  I didn t want to be your friend anyway!  in order to save face. And by all means, invoke the investigation into Hillary s email server to smear Buzzfeed and deflect attention from the real problem, which is Trump. That just compounds the flimsiness of their response.Earlier on Monday, Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti explained in a letter that they won t accept Trump ads because Trump is dangerous. He compared Trump ads to cigarette ads, saying that they don t run cigarette ads for that same reason. They don t want to be seen as endorsing something that s fundamentally bad for them and for us.Peretti is especially concerned about Trump wanting to limit freedom of the press, ban Muslims and get rid of immigrants: The Trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and in some cases, such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims, would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs. They do intend to continue covering Trump, though, and their coverage is brutal enough for him to specifically target them at rallies and elsewhere.

"June 6, 2017","One of the major things with Donald Trump s speech at the NATO summit that shocked everyone was his refusal to commit to Article 5, which basically states that an attack on one member is an attack on all. But his speech wasn t supposed to be that way. 27 words were removed from that speech, and that threw his national security team for a loop. They had no idea those words had been deleted.Trump was supposed to say: We face many threats, but I stand here before you with a clear message: the U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance and to Article 5 is unwavering. But he didn t. And his national security team (and really, the rest of his administration) was left to clean up the shitstorm that resulted from that removal. Everyone, from Mike Pence to National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, has been on  cleanup duty,  going out of their way to try and convince the world that we do, in fact, remain committed to Article 5.But apparently, the White House doesn t think it matters (here s a hint to them: It does). Spicer told reporters that he thought the whole mess was  a silly discussion,  and that Trump s presence at the summit should have been enough to show our allies that we remain committed to all 13 Articles of the NATO alliance.Spicer made it sound like Trump deigned to attend an event which was beneath him and thus, not worthy of his time.Because of his ridiculous behavior and terrible understanding of everything, foreign policy advisers are now frantically trying to convince our allies that they still matter to us, and that Trump is still their partner.Trump put our allies badly on edge when he refused to commit to Article 5, and with other things he said at both the NATO summit and the G7 summit. In doing so, he s forced Germany and France to try and isolate us in order to maintain the strength of their own alliances, because Trump just proved that we are no longer a steadfast and true partner.

The speech was more sober and low energy than most Trump speeches have been, and used more sophisticated language than Trump s traditional events.But he still stuck his foot in it.During the speech, Trump made a reference to helping  our African-American people  who live in the  inner city  that have been  mistreated  for so long.Coming just a few days after referring to a black man in one of his rallies as  my African-American,  the comment hit a sour note for many people, especially as it sounded like a possessive reference to ownership.Twitter users took Trump to task for the comment almost immediately after he said it:Trump: It's gonna be great.

He described Mexican immigrants as  criminals  and  rapists,  while also calling for a ban on Muslim travel to the United States.His campaign has also received support from white supremacists, who have bankrolled robocalls in his favor and a super PAC backing his election. Trump was endorsed by notorious former klansman David Duke and his campaign arranged for a white supremacist radio show to get credentials to cover them.Trump even rejected multiple opportunities in an interview with CNN s Jake Tapper to denounce and reject support from Duke. Instead he stubbornly tried to deflect the question.His most diehard supporters have echoed Trump s rhetoric, while the most extreme have even assaulted black protesters at his rallies, and in one instance a Latino man was beat up and assaulted by a pair of men who cited Trump as they engaged in violence.So, tell us again how The Donald is not a racist.Featured image via YouTube", Twitter Destroyed Trump For This Racist Comment During His Victory Speech (VIDEO)

"June 8, 2016","David Duke, who s best known as a former Ku Klux Klan leader and failed politician, has a whole new conspiracy surrounding Donald Trump. You see, it s not really that Trump s a racist. It s just that Wolf Blitzer and the rest of the Jewish media is making him seem racist. Damn those unedited videos.Pointing out  the Jewish establishment knows all about psychology,  Duke went on to explain that they have the ability to  marshal up an army of Jews  to go after opponents like Trump by sending out experts to attack him.Duke cast a wide net, including Chris Wallace from Fox News, CNN s Jake Tapper as well as Blitzer from CNN, who Duke claims he has already exposed as a  Jewish agent from AIPAC. Duke went on to point out that CNN is run by  Jewish extremist  Jeff Zucker, helpfully noting that Zucker has said  he lives and breathes Israel. They re the ones who have been attacking Trump,  Duke continued,  And most recently Fox News, the shabbat goy shiksa Megyn Kelly, because they love to have some gentile   they don t always want all the Jews out front. She recently criticized Trump, the fact that he said this judge isn t fair. This Mexican judge. This Mexican-descended judge. Source: Raw StoryDuke was especially peeved at the Trump University scandal, in which Trump is accused of bilking thousands of people out of upwards of $35,000. Trump is the one who is alleged to have committed fraud, yet, the Jews (and the  Mexican  who s not Mexican, judge):Media coverage of the case is  very illustrative of the Jewish tribal nature,  Duke said:  They re like a pack of wild dogs when they go after someone who they see as a threat to the Jewish agenda, as the neocons see Trump as a threat as a non-interventionist. The viciousness of these Jews is unbelievable,  he added.  I think this whole Trump University case really exploited, can really expose the entire Jewish manipulation of the American media, the American political process. Source: Jerusalem PostHere s the audio:Clearly, Duke is certifiable. He has long had it in for the  Jewish cabal  and a candidate like Trump seems tailor made for the white supremacist. While the  the Jews did it  defense might not resonate with most Trump voters (after all, they claim to love Israel), there will continue to be a lot of blaming of the media for the words that come out of Trump s mouth.Featured image via David Duke s Facebook page.", Insane David Duke Rant: Trump’s Not Really Racist – It’s Just Wolf Blitzer And The Rest Of The Jews (AUDIO)
"June 8, 2017","While team Trump is making light of the damage done by former FBI Director James Comey s highly anticipated testimony on Thursday, the public knows that the amateur president s decision to fire the very man leading an investigation into possible collusion and ties between his administration and Russian officials was only to protect himself. Comey isn t the first official the former reality show star has fired who was leading an investigation into his administration s growing scandal.In fact, a bigly amount of people aren t buying what Trump is selling. The firing of James Comey shocked the nation because of the timing of it all.According to a new poll, more than 60 percent of Americans think that Trump fired Comey in order to protect himself rather than to help the country.Time Magazine reports:Seven in 10 (72%) Americans don t trust Trump s word on Russia, but 55% also don t buy Comey s   likely a reflection of his own past controversies such as Hillary Clinton s email scandal and an overall distrust of the federal government, according to results from an ABC News and Washington Post survey.Only 27% felt that Trump dismissed Comey for the good of country. A majority of respondents (56%) believe the President is trying to interfere with the Russia probe Comey was supervising prior to his firing.It s not just Democrats, but conservatives, too, who doubt that Trump fired Comey for selfless reasons in order to Make America Great Again. Even conservatives know that it s about Russia. In fact, a whopping 60 percent had low trust in regards to what Trump claims about Russia   just 33 percent said that they had substantial trust. That means that Trump is losing his own base.The polls are certainly going to get worse for Trump after voters are polled following the testimony today in which Comey suggested that his termination from the FBI was for nefarious reasons. Comey has a go-in-alone strategy and he took notes of their meetings after feeling uncomfortable because of Trump s actions. Comey said he was not made to feel that way by former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. But he did feel that way with Trump.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images", A HUGE Percentage Of Americans Think Trump Fired James Comey Only To Protect Himself

Biden said Trump s taunting of the judge was a  direct threat  to  defy  the court if he were elected president, and a clear sign of a tyrannical mindset proving Trump  cannot be trusted to respect the independence of the Judiciary as a president.

It is the strongest condemnation to come from the executive branch on Trump s behavior.Biden also pointed out that despite Republicans condemning Trump, they are still holding up the nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court seat vacated after the death of Antonin Scalia. Biden specifically mentioned that even the Republicans who admitted Trump was being racist are still working on behalf of him being the one to choose the next justice.The remarks come on a day of major Democratic unity, as President Obama announced that he was endorsing Hillary Clinton and would begin campaigning with her. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she would endorse Clinton and Governor Martin O Malley also announced that he would back the former Secretary of State. While Sen. Bernie Sanders did not yet concede the nomination, he met with President Obama and said he had spoken with Secretary Clinton and would be working with her to stop Trump s quest to be elected president.Featured image via Twitter", ‘Racist’ And ‘Reprehensible’: How Joe Biden Just Took Trump Down (VIDEO)

It s driving him insane   so insane that he has deigned it appropriate to cave to pressure to testify. Under oath. Where lies become crimes. It s like f*cking Christmas.In the aftermath of Comey s testimony, The Donald attempted to demonize the former director, complaining that he is a  LEAKER  because he passed on his not the least bit classified thoughts on his meeting with Trump.Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication and WOW, Comey is a leaker!

I would be glad to tell him exactly what I told you,  the president said during a press conference in the White House Rose Garden. Yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction,  Trump said, ignoring that Comey said nothing to dispute collusion or obstruction. He refused to comment in an open setting.  But we were very, very happy and, frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said. And some of the things that he said just weren t true. Yes, according to The Donald, Comey   a liar    confirmed  many of the things he has said, even though he s a lying liar whose pants are on fire.Though he originally threatened to release tapes of his conversations with Comey, The Donald now says they may not exist, telling reporters that you will be very disappointed when you hear the answer.

"Mar 14, 2016","So is anyone else wondering why the cop-hating, racist, Bernie Sanders supporter Tommy DiMassimo wasn t arrested and charged with a felony? Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s campaign rallies have become a fixture in the 2016 election season as much for the candidate s rambling speeches as for the frequent interruptions of said speeches.Demonstrators have filed in to Trump rallies across the country, shouting their anti-Trump messages and promptly being ridiculed by rally-goers and led out by law enforcement.On Saturday, Trump began to call for the arrest of protesters as he was repeatedly interrupted, raising questions about the legality of protest and whether Trump can press charges against demonstrators. So what are the answers?The short answer is, no.According to H.R. 347 (signed into law by Barack Hussein Obama in February, 2012) it is ILLEGAL under CURRENT FEDERAL to protest of any type, in an area under protection by the U.S. Secret Service.Because Donald Trump is under Secret Service Protection (as is Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders) and has been since November of 2015, it is a FEDERAL CRIME to protest at campaign rallies, and is in fact, punishable by imprisonment.Free Speech isn t covered at ANY Trump, Clinton, Sanders (or Cruz, Rubio, Kasich) rally because protests are considered to be  knowingly impeding or disrupting the orderly conduct of an official Federal function. Law enforcement has simply tossed out protesters at Trump rallies, but H.R. 347 states that they could be imprisoned for up to a year for trespassing.Demonstrators are technically relegated to free speech zones much like the ones seen on college campuses.Such zones are often used to keep dissenters away from media attention, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.At a recent Trump event at Valdosta State University, in Georgia, the two designated free speech zones were not in sight of the arena where the rally was held. One was a quarter mile away.Trump can call for the arrest of whomever he wants, but he can t do the arresting.He has said, however, that he is  going to start pressing charges  against protesters as a way to intimidate them into thinking twice about demonstrating at his rallies.Based on the change to H.R. 347 in 2012, he may have grounds to press for trespassing charges against any protester who walked into the rally knowing it was a restricted area, according to the ACLU.

"Mar 15, 2017","Just two years ago, the Obama White House welcomed Russia s top internal security official, Alexander Bortnikov, to Washington, as the head of a Kremlin delegation attending a highly publicized U.S. government summit on countering violent extremism.Obama was caught on an open mic telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev (on the left) who is pictured toasting with Vladimir Putin and Head of the Federal Security Service Alexander Bortnikov, that he would  have more flexibility  after his second term. Of course, the mainstream media all but ignored the disturbing conversation. They re all over the fake news story however about Trump and his alleged Russian ties, of which they have absolutely NO evidence. What U.S. officials did not then know is that officers of the agency that Bortnikov heads, the FSB or Federal Security Service, were at that moment directing an audacious state-sponsored cyberattack to penetrate Yahoo s email network, deploying criminal hackers to steal data on 500 million email users, according to criminal charges unveiled by the Justice Department on Wednesday. The indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in California charged two FSB officers and two civilians   one Russian and one from Kazakhstan, now living in Canada   with crimes including computer hacking and economic espionage.The FSB sponsored cyberattack, which lasted from 2014 to last September, was described by government officials today as one of the largest data breaches in history: It involved the theft of vast amounts of credit card data and other financial information, as well as personal details on individuals of high interest to the Russian government: journalists, U.S. officials and U.S. and foreign corporate executives and employees, including a senior officer of a major U.S. airline and even a Nevada gaming official.But what was especially galling to U.S. officials is that the two FSB officers at the center of the plot, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, were assigned to the agency s Center for Information Security, or Center 18   a cybercrime unit that was the FBI s point of contact for investigating criminal hacking operations. What this shows is that we ve been had,  said Steve Hall, a former CIA station chief in Moscow who later directed agency operations in Russia.  Center 18 was the part of the FSB that was supposed to be working with us. But instead of working with the FBI and CIA to catch hackers, the FSB officers were actually working with hackers themselves, according to the Justice Department charges. In the Yahoo attack, two alleged cybercriminals were also charged as co-conspirators in the plot. One of them, Alexsey Belan, a notorious cyberthief who has been twice indicted in the United States and is on the FBI s  Cyber Most Wanted  list, received  sensitive  law enforcement and intelligence information from the FSB that helped him avoid detection by the FBI and facilitated his theft of proprietary Yahoo data   including stealing the company s Account Management Tool (AMT), a system that Yahoo used to make and log changes to user accounts. His purpose, a senior U.S. official said today, was to  line his own pockets with money.

"Mar 16, 2017","With a growing number of Muslim refugees and immigrants living in America who are strict adherents of Sharia Law, it should come as no surprise that female genital mutilation is not so uncommon anymore in many parts of the United States. It is a felony to perform a clitorectomy on a female in America, but getting caught is the hard part A petition from the womens  group Equality Now reveals that immigration has put the United States on a list that will be much more difficult for progressive immigration enthusiasts to cheer. A massive influx of immigrants from Muslim-populated countries in Africa and the Middle East has led the group to conclude that more than half a million girls in the U.S. are in danger of having their exposed sexual organs skinned from their bodies.The practice is known as female genital mutilation (FGM).The Atlantic describes how the procedure is carried out:It usually involves the complete removal of the clitoris, and often the removal of some of the inner and outer labia. In its most extreme form infibulation almost all the external genitalia are cut away, the remaining flesh from the outer labia is sewn together, or infibulated, and the girl s legs are bound from ankle to waist for several weeks while scar tissue closes up the vagina almost completely. A small hole, typically about the diameter of a pencil, is left for urination and menstruation. The cutting is usually done with a razor, a kitchen knife, or a pair of scissors. It is rare for any anesthesia to be used.As the United States continues to mail out immigrant visas to countries with hostile and violent attitudes towards women, it will increasingly challenge Americans  self-perception of what it means to live in a First World country.Haha Dukureh, an FGM-survivor and founder of the activist organization Safe Hands for Girls, warned that  every year thousands of girls here in the United States go through female genital mutilation.

An Ethiopian man convicted of aggravated battery and cruelty to children was removed from the United States on Monday.Khalid Adem, 41, was arrested for using scissors to mutilate the genitals of his 2-year-old daughter.He was deported on Monday after serving 10 years in prison.Adem was an Ethiopian citizen and native when he was living in Gwinnett County, Georgia in 2006. (He was convicted in 2006, but his wife who turned him in believes the crime was committed in 2001). His case was drew national attention for being the first criminal conviction in the United States for female genital mutilation (FGM).He became the catalyst for the specific criminalization of FGM under Georgia state law.Female genital mutilation is a federal crime, and any involvement in committing this crime is a human rights violation that results in imprisonment and potential deportation.

"Mar 18, 2016","Shades of Baltimore? How can citizens or visitors in Chicago ever feel safe knowing the Chief Of Police would tell his officers to  stand down  when they are faced with a potential powder keg of violence and chaos? How can his officers feel safe knowing they were putting them in harms way? One can t help but wonder how much involvement our very own corrupt Chicago Community Organizer In Chief had to do with the decision to give the paid protesters free reign to terrorize Trump supporters? A union that represents 54 officers from the University of Illinois at Chicago Police Department is speaking out arguing the chaotic Donald Trump rally on campus last week did not have to escalate to an extreme level of disorder and could have continued as planned.The Metropolitan Association of Police Board Director, Ray Violetto, tells Fox News that UIC Police Chief, Kevin Booker, issued unusual stand-down orders including instructions that officers not bring pepper spray or wear dark gloves to the Trump rally items the union officers say are basic and necessary equipment in any type of crowd control.Violetto tells Fox News the UIC police were the agency in charge considering the Trump rally was on the school s campus and that the officers were in charge of policing the inside of the arena. I think the inside is what started that and I think it carried outside,  Violetto told Fox News.  If you watch the inside of the rally there was a pretty large group there that was getting out of control along with the individual that was at the podium. Violetto said officers were also told not to touch anyone or make arrests. The UIC officers say they have been extensively trained in handling crowds and riots and could have adequately controlled the situation that night.Watch how quickly these pockets of paid protesters turned violent and shockingly, how many police officers were put in harms way:The MAP police say not only were they put in physical danger but they also were potentially left open to lawsuits because the three people who officers say they rightfully and legally arrested were let go without explanation as a result of the Chief s no-arrest order.UIC spokesperson Sherri McGinnis Gonzalez denies the officers  claims and says riot gear was available  if needed. In an email, Gonzalez wrote that pepper spray is typically not used inside the campus arena, officers were not given orders not to place their hands on people, and that officers were told not to wear  dark  gloves, which look  aggressive. Violetto argues there are  no white gloves that are out there. Gonzalez also wrote that most of the UIC officers were in full uniform with personal protective gear, with the exception of plain-clothes detectives who provided surveillance and valuable intelligence.These police officers don t look like they re wearing riot gear, or are very well prepared for the violence at all in these very telling videos taken by Chuck Pullen, who happened to be at the scene : CLICK HEREThe University says Booker was on site and in charge of managing all UIC police activity and coordinated with multiple law enforcement agencies during the event.

The Association of Public Television Stations has hired lobbyists to fight the cuts. Hundreds of taxpayer-supported TV, radio and Web outlets have partnered with an advocacy campaign to facilitate emails and phone calls to Capitol Hill for the purpose of telling members of Congress,  Public broadcasting funding is too important to eliminate! PBS President Paula Kerger even recorded a personal television appeal that told viewers exactly how to contact members of Congress in order to  let your representative know how you feel about the elimination of funding for public broadcasting.  But if PBS can pay Ms. Kerger $632,233 in annual compensation as reported on the 990 tax forms all nonprofits are required to file surely it can operate without tax dollars Meanwhile, highly successful, brand-name public programs like Sesame Street make millions on their own.

"Mar 21, 2016","It s hard to imagine a President who could be more anti-American and more pro-terror than Barack Hussein Obama. And then my mind drifts to Hillary and Benghazi The Obama administration is emptying the military s Guantanamo Bay detention facility of avowed terrorists captured fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but several American service members languish in another military prison for actions on those same battlefields that their supporters say merit clemency, if not gratitude.Among the prison population at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas, are remaining members of the so-called  Leavenworth 10,  convicted service members doing terms ranging from 10 to 40 years for heat-of-the-battle decisions their supporters say saved American lives.[quote_box_center] The very people who protect our freedoms and liberties are having their own freedoms and liberties taken away,  said retired U.S. Army Col. Allen West, a former congressman and political commentator.  I think it s appalling and no one is talking about this issue. [/quote_box_center]The  Leavenworth 10  is the name given to a fluctuating number of men housed at Leavenworth for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that their supporters say were justified. Over the years, a handful have been paroled, and more have been incarcerated.Among the more well-known cases is that of Army First Lt. Clint Lorance, who is serving a 20-year sentence for ordering his men to shoot two suspected Taliban scouts in July 2012 in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. Lorance had just taken command of the platoon after the prior leader and several others were killed days before. The Taliban suspects were on motorcycles and matched descriptions given by a pilot who flew over the area earlier and spotted them as scouts.A Facebook page devoted to Lorance s case has drawn more than 12,000 likes, and supporters have launched a website, FreeClintLorance.com, dedicated to winning his release. A WhiteHouse.gov petition calling for Lorance to be pardoned garnered nearly 125,000 signatures, but the White House has not taken action.Critics say Lorance was given a military trial, and his conviction was based in large part on the testimony of men serving under him.It was September of 2010 when Sgt. Derrick Miller of Maryland, on a combat mission in a Taliban-held area of Afghanistan, was warned the unit s base had been penetrated. An Afghan suspected of being an enemy combatant was brought to Miller for interrogation and wound up dead. Miller claimed the suspect tried to grab his gun and that he shot him in self-defense. But he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.U.S. Army Master Sgt. John Hatley   a highly decorated, 20-year vet who served in Operation Desert Storm and did another three tours during the Iraq War   also is serving a life sentence at Leavenworth. His conviction stems from an April, 2007, incident in Iraq in which he and his unit captured enemies following a firefight. He radioed a U.S. detention facility to notify officials he was bringing in four prisoners, but was ordered to let them go, according to his legal team.Two years later, a sergeant who had served with Hatley, Jesse Cunningham, was facing charges for assaulting another officer and falling asleep at his post. As leverage for a plea deal, he told investigators that Hatley and two other officers had taken the insurgents to a remote location, blindfolded them and shot each in the back of the head. He claimed their bodies were dumped in a canal, though none was ever found.Hatley, now 47, insists he and his men let the insurgents go, but believes he was punished in the interest of the government s relations with Baghdad. When concerns over appeasing a foreign country are allowed to interfere with justice for the purpose of the U.S. government or the military demonstrating that we, the military or the U.S. government will hold our soldiers accountable using a fatally flawed military judicial system, it doesn t matter what the truth is; it matters only that there is only the appearance of the truth,  he wrote in a message to supporters posted on freeJohnHatley.com.Law experts say military service members face a daunting task once accused of committing crimes in the heat of war. Killing on the battlefield is not the same as [a police officer] killing someone on the streets,  Dan Conway, an attorney who specializes in military law, told FoxNews.com.  When a cop uses force, there s a line of duty investigation. When a soldier uses force, it is investigated as criminal, and non-infantry investigators handle the case, many who have no combat experience. If you had experts handling the investigation, you d have much more balance,  he added.While the military rightly holds its soldiers to a high standard of justice, detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay have been freed even with no mitigating circumstances or reasonable belief of rehabilitation. The release of Gitmo detainees began during the presidency of George W. Bush in 2005 when nearly 200 detainees were released before any tribunals were held.According to a March 2015 memo released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, of the 647 detainees transferred or released, 17.9 percent were confirmed of re-engaging in extremist activity with another 10.7 percent suspected of doing the same.

Furthermore, this reckless policy of placing same sex kids in bathrooms and locker rooms puts children in danger of being in private spaces with sexual predators and or sexual offenders Make sure to add your comments to the MI Board of Educations HEREMichigan s State Board of Education has drafted a guidance that would push the state s schools to allow all students, regardless of parental or doctoral input, to choose their gender, name, pronouns, and bathrooms.Spearheaded by board president John C. Austin and signed by state superintendent Brian Whiston, the guidance informs Michigan public schools that only the students themselves i.e. not their parents or doctors can determine what their individual gender identities are. The responsibility for determining a student s gender identity rests with the student. Outside confirmation from medical or mental health professionals, or documentation of legal changes, is not needed,  the guidance states.Gender identity is defined in the guidance as  a person s deeply held internal sense or psychological knowledge of their own gender, regardless of the biological sex they were assigned at birth. Notably, the guidance makes no mention of a student s age affecting whether or not they can pick a gender without their parent or doctor.In fact, the guidance seems to intentionally cut parents out of the process.The guidance states:  School staff should address students by their chosen name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, regardless of whether there has been a legal name change. Students can even ask to have their chosen name and gender  included in the district s information management systems, in addition to the student s legal name. But what about when school staff members are speaking with parents about their son or daughter?The guidance states that  Transgender and GNC [gender nonconforming] students have the right to decide when, with whom, and to what extent to share private information. Accordingly, the board makes clear,  When contacting the parent/guardian of a transgender or GNC student, school staff should use the student s legal name and the pronoun corresponding to the student s assigned sex at birth, unless the student or parent/guardian has specified otherwise. In other words, a boy named  Jake  could become a girl named  Jane  at school, seemingly without his parents ever knowing.Names, pronouns, and genders aren t the only things the board wants students to choose.The guidance informs schools that  Students should be allowed to use the restroom in accordance with their gender identity. And the board makes clear that single-stall bathrooms are not inclusive enough:  Alternative and non-stigmatizing options, such as an all-gender or singleuser restroom (e.g., staff bathroom or nurse s office), should be made available to students who request them, but not presented as the only option. Locker rooms also should become inclusive of students  many gender identities.  A student should not be required to use a locker room that is incongruent with their gender identity,  the guidance states.  Locker room usage should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the guiding principles of safety and honoring the student s gender identity and expression. Students who are bothered by having members of the opposite sex in their locker rooms can request  an adjusted changing schedule  or  use of a private area in the facility. The board quietly issued the statement and guidance on February 23rd, without a press release. The public has only until April 11th to comment on the proposed guidance, according to the Department of Education website. The board will finalize the guidance at a meeting on May 10th.

Meanwhile a few streets away human rights protesters were busy burning American flags and demanding Obama leave the country. The protesters accuse America of backing dictatorial regimes during the Cold War in South America, including in Argentina, and hold the U.S. responsible for the thousands who died or were disappeared under their rule.Today marks the 40th anniversary of the military coup in Argentina that ushered in one of the most oppressive dictatorships in Latin American history, which demonstrators argue makes Obama s visit particularly offensive.Earlier in the day, Obama sought to deflect criticism of his foreign travel in the wake of Belgium s terror attacks, saying the U.S. must show ISIS that it does not have power over its citizens.  We are strong, our values are right. You offer nothing, except death,  Obama said of ISIS.Gesturing in the direction of Argentinian President Mauricio Macri, who was standing to his left at a joint news conference this afternoon in Buenos Aires, Obama said,  It is important for the United States president and the United States government to be able to work with people who are building and who are creating things.

"Mar 26, 2016","Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton came out in agreement with Donald Trump last week on our role in NATO. They disagree on a solution but it s a great idea and about time they bring this to the forefront. SENATOR TOM COTTON ON AMERICA S ROLE IN NATO:Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton on Friday discussed his participation in a meeting with Donald Trump earlier this week, remarking that he and the Republican presidential frontrunner have similar concerns when it comes to the United States  role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  You know, he had spoken earlier that day to The Washington Post editorial board and raised some serious questions about NATO. I share some of those questions,  Cotton said in an interview with MSNBC s  Morning Joe.   We used to split our costs 50/50 between the U.S. and Europe. Today, it s 70-30 between the U.S. and Europe.  Read more: PoliticoIn an interview with The Washington Post editorial board, Donald Trump made an accurate statement about the U.S. subsidization of fellow NATO members:TRUMP: Look, I see NATO as a good thing to have   I look at the Ukraine situation and I say, so Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we are doing all of the lifting, they re not doing anything. And I say, why is it that Germany is not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of the Ukraine not dealing with   why are we always the one that s leading, potentially the third world war, okay, with Russia? Why are we always the ones that are doing it? And I think the concept of NATO is good, but I do think the United States has to have some help. We are not helped. I ll give you a better example than that. I mean, we pay billions   hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries that are in theory wealthier than we are.DIEHL: Hundreds of billions?TRUMP: Billions.Trump s GOP opponents jumped on his comments and accused him of suggesting that the U.S. should leave NATO, or at least cut back its support of the alliance.In fact, Trump was correct that the U.S. is paying  hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries  via NATO each year, never mind additional military subsidies to non-NATO allies.In 2014, the collective GDP of all NATO members was US$37.5 trillion. During the same year, the alliance spent a total of US$924 billion on military expenditures, of which the U.S. spent the majority ($610 billion), according to the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database.Consequently, the alliance collectively spent 2.47% of GDP on defense. The U.S. was the only member above this value, coming in at 3.5% of GDP. In other words, the U.S. subsidizes each and every other member of NATO.This leads us to the following chart, showing the individual defense spending deficits toward the common defense in 2014 for each NATO member   note that the U.S. has a  surplus  of US$180 billion that equals the sum of all other member deficits.Unsurprisingly, Germany (US$47 billion per year) and Canada (US$26 billion per year) are the biggest NATO laggards, followed closely by Spain and Italy at $US21 billion per year each. These four countries constitute almost two thirds of the total NATO deficit that has to be covered by the United States.Trump had good instincts on this.Read more: American Thinker",DONALD TRUMP WAS RIGHT AGAIN: U.S. Funds NATO In The Hundreds Of Billions

CEO Mark Fields responded to Trump s criticism in a recent interview with CNN s Poppy Harlow. He said Ford is committed to adding jobs in the U.S.Last July, Trump blasted Ford for having manufacturing operations in Mexico.  What does that do? We don t get anything. Does Mexico come here and build factories here? We lose a fortune with every deal  that adds jobs overseas, Trump claimed.Fields defended Ford s track record on supporting American jobs.  We ve created 25,000 jobs [in the U.S.] since 2011, and going forward over the next four years we ve agreed to either retain or add another 8,500 jobs,  Fields said.  The amount of money that we invest in [research and development] here is more than companies like Apple. Ford invested nearly $7 billion in R&D in the U.S. in 2014 alone, Field said.The Republican presidential frontrunner s criticism of Ford largely centered around Ford s plans to invest $2.5 billion in its Mexican operations.Then in October, Trump took credit for Ford supposedly canceling those plans and opening a new factory in Ohio instead.In fact, Ford said it planned to go forward with its $2.5 billion expansion in Mexico.

"Mar 29, 2016","Americans had to know it would come to this. The anarchists, the whiny, petulant college students with nothing better to do and the angry BLM protesters are about to meet up with a group who doesn t care much about their feelings or about political correctness. A large percentage of bikers who belong to groups are veterans who have fought for our nation and are not about to step aside and allow a billionaire communist who supports a woman under investigation by the FBI and left four of their brothers to die in Benghazi, to take away the right of Americans to attend a political rally for a candidate they support.It s a military tradition of sorts, running back more than six decades.In the wake of World War II, as a generation of troops returned home from combat, veterans across the country found a certain pleasure and purpose through a newly evolved piece of gear they d become friendly with downrange: the motorcycle.New  motorcycle clubs  sprang up everywhere, filling the void of camaraderie and brotherhood   not to mention adrenaline and adventure   that many found themselves craving with the end of their military service.They called themselves  outlaws    not because they were criminals but because they refused to be boxed in by the rules and regulations of the fledgling American Motorcycle Association. Combat is where motorcycle outlaws come from,  says Don Charles Davis, who writes the Aging Rebel biker news blog from Los Angeles.  Clubs like the Boozefighters and the Outlaws were either invented or transformed by veterans on cheap Army surplus bikes. One club in particular drew its inspiration from the 3rd Pursuit Squadron of the Flying Tigers, the American volunteers who flew combat missions against the Japanese over China. The squadron was better known among the fliers as  Hells Angels. It was just the first of three waves of motorcycle club membership, Davis says. The second surge, of which the former II Corps artilleryman was a part, arose in the wake of Vietnam. Like many war fighters returning home to a largely hostile nation, he found his own family among bikers.That s when clubs such as the Mongols, the Devils Disciples   named after a George Bernard Shaw play about Revolutionary War patriot Ethan Allen, Davis says   and the Bandidos got their start, again largely fueled by returning veterans.And now a new generation of currently serving troops and veterans are pouring into the old clubs, and starting their own groups as well.

It s really overwhelming. I was not anticipating this kind of response,  Mittness said.While Mittness is working to have a peaceful protest that doesn t interfere with the Trump event, Janesville police are preparing for any possibility.Janesville Police Chief Dave Moore said Friday he didn t yet know how many officers would be assisgned, but his department reached out to police agencies in Rock County, including the sheriff s office, as well as the State Patrol, DNR and Dane County Sheriff s Office.The joint Beloit-Janesville-Rock County sheriff s  mobile field force,  which specializes in crowd control, will be there, Moore said.Moore noted the Janesville Conference Center holds 1,000 and said he expects  a substantial number of people  outside.

Further, they demonstrate how exercising this important authority can remedy imbalances and rectify errors in sentencing. In a letter to one of the pardoned criminals   Terry Barnes of Mississippi   Obama explained that he was granting him a commutation to allow him to turn his life around. It embodies the basic belief in our democracy that people deserve a second chance after having made a mistake in their lives that led to a conviction under our laws,  he wrote, acknowledging that some were skeptical about his ability to change.

"Mar 4, 2016","Because people who scale border walls and break the law to get into our country deserve the same taxpayer funded benefits as legal citizens right?Caving into the demands of the open borders movement and pro-immigrant Spanish media, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will refrain from enforcing immigration laws in areas of Flint, Michigan affected by a water crisis. The water amnesty is the latest of many reprieves issued by the Obama administration to help illegal immigrants nationwide. Judicial Watch has reported on many of them, including recent hurricane, earthquake, Ebola and  severe weather  amnesties.This one involves the widely reported water situation in Flint, which is located about 66 miles northwest of Detroit. Last year researchers discovered that the city s drinking water was contaminated with lead from decaying old pipes. The problem arose after a switch in 2014 in the city s water source to save money. Soon complaints mounted that the water smelled and looked strange and academic researchers discovered that it was toxic. This all occurred after a 7-1 vote by the Flint City Council to stop buying Detroit water and join a new pipeline project, according to a local news report.Now there s a state of emergency and the feds have stepped in, supplying the area with free bottled water and special filters to install at home until the local water supply is clean. For weeks immigrant rights groups complained that residents had to show identification to receive their free goods from the government and illegal aliens were being left out. National Spanish-language media outlets blasted the Obama administration for discriminating against illegal aliens. One reported that undocumented immigrants weren t getting help for fear of being deported, instead opting to drink contaminated water or pay out of pocket to buy some. Another major Spanish-language newspaper wrote that illegal immigrants and their children suffered lead poisoning and couldn t get clean emergency water because they didn t have identification cards.  When the National Guard went door to door distributing potable water, many were scared to open because they feared the uniformed persons were immigration agents who would deport them,  the paper wrote.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which claims to combat bigotry and protect civil rights for all, joined the cause expressing  horror  and  indignation  that the government denied undocumented immigrants free water and filters because they couldn t provide a photo ID or Social Security number. In a Spanish-language statement the group s Michigan chapter referred to news reports that Flint-area fire department stations distributing water were requiring identification. But even in places that aren t requiring ID, illegal immigrants are scared to come out and get their potable water out of fear that they will be deported, the ADL stresses in its announcement.  We are calling on the National Guard to order all fire departments and other centers distributing supplies that no one be rejected. Like a good lapdog the Obama administration obliged. This week DHS issued a statement in English and Spanish guaranteeing that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would not conduct enforcement operations at or near locations distributing clean water in Flint or surrounding areas.  Moreover, DHS officials do not and will not pose as individuals providing water-related information or distributing clean water as part of any enforcement activities,  the statement assures. The agency s priority is to support state and local government efforts to distribute clean water, the statement says, adding that DHS stands  ready to assist those in need.

Hillary Clinton has turned the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, into a central issue for her campaign and will look to capitalize on that focus when she faces Bernie Sanders at Saturday s Democratic debate in the troubled city, but in the 1992 Democratic primary, it was Bill Clinton who was on defense for standing by as Arkansas  water was polluted.Former senator Tom Harkin (D., Iowa) went after Clinton during a candidate forum that year for putting himself forward as an environmentalist even though Arkansas was an environmental disaster during his tenure as governor. Mr. Clinton, that was a very nice, flowery little speech, but we have to start reading the records and not the lips,  said Harkin, who went on to point out that Arkansas was rated last in environmental policy during his governorship.Here s video of the interaction:Harkin also said that Clinton s Environmental Protection Agency was  a joke  and that it was  loaded with representatives of the biggest polluter in Arkansas. That polluter was Tyson Foods, a powerful political backer of Clinton that contaminated the drinking water supply of more than 300,000 people with roughly 500,000 tons of chicken waste that was dumped into streams. The presence of  fecal bacteria  in the water caused entire towns near Tyson plants to be plagued by chronic dysentery and salmonella.In one case, it took Clinton 17 months after being notified by health inspectors that a Tyson plant was leaking 1 million gallons of sewage into a town s water supply to take any action.This turned into a major issue in the 1992 campaign, and not just for Clinton s opponents.After Clinton won his party s nomination, CNN sent a reporter to Arkansas to examine just how bad the environmental situation was.Here s video of the lengthy report:The report found that state agencies were aware that 3,700 miles of Arkansas waterways were at risk of being destroyed by  agricultural source pollution  and that it took Clinton until 1990 to create a task force to address the problem.One scientist who focused on the quality of Arkansas water expressed his belief to CNN that the only reason Clinton formed the task force was because of his presidential aspirations. I think there is a direct connection between the current emphasis on animal waste and runoff and his bid for the presidency,  said hydrologist Skip Halterman.Clinton is also criticized by CNN for giving a third of the seats on the task force to members of the poultry industry that was a major source of political contributions for Clinton.

"Mar 7, 2017","House Republicans leaders on Monday embraced a legislative plan to replace the Affordable Care Act for the first time in the nearly seven years since Democrats enacted the transformative health-insurance law.Now, they have to sell it.That challenge ran into an immediate threat from key conservatives who criticized the new proposal for failing to fulfill the party s iron-clad promise to rip out the signature policy of former President Barack Obama.  It s Obamacare in a different format,  Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, said in a phone interview. Jordan cited three provisions that conservatives have complained about for weeks leading up to the formal release of the House GOP plan on Monday evening: its extension of Obamacare Medicaid expansion for another four years; its failure to immediately repeal all of the law s tax increases; and its call to provide refundable tax credits to help people buy insurance, which Jordan labeled  a new entitlement. Earlier on Monday, another member of the Freedom Caucus, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, condemned the leadership bill in a two-word tweet:  Obamacare 2.0.  The full Freedom Caucus comprises about three dozen members of the 237 in the House Republican majority. If they voted as a bloc, they could sink the bill on their own. A spokeswoman for its chairman, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, said members were still reviewing the legislation on Monday evening, and Jordan said the group planned to meet on Tuesday to discuss it.The reaction from conservative advocacy groups was no more favorable to the Republican leadership. FreedomWorks labeled the plan s requirement that people pay a 30 percent premium to insurers if they stop their coverage for more than two months  the Republican individual mandate. And on Tuesday morning, two more staunchly conservative activist organizations, Heritage Action and the Club for Growth, came out against the proposal.  Many Americans seeking health insurance on the individual market will notice no significant difference between the Affordable Care Act (i.e., Obamacare) and the American Health Care Act,  the group s president, Michael Needham said.  That is bad politics and, more importantly, bad policy. Rather than accept the flawed premises of Obamacare, congressional Republicans should fully repeal the failed law and begin a genuine effort to deliver on longstanding campaign promises that create a free market health-care system that empowers patients and doctors.  The Club for Growth pejoratively dubbed the new bill  RyanCare  and added a new threat, vowing to downgrade any Republican who votes for the bill in the group s closely-watched annual congressional scorecard.- The AtlanticThe introduction of the GOP s new healthcare bill has raised some definite ire among Republicans and Libertarians alike. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is one such politician who has now seen the bill and expressed his extreme dislike of it, calling the GOP plan  Obamacare Lite. According to The Hill, Paul is not letting Obamacare Lite happen without a fight, and he has allies. The libertarian leaning senator is teaming up with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to release their own bill to repeal Obamacare on Wednesday, and it s highly similar to the one that Republicans voted for unanimously in 2015. We voted on this last year, and every Republican voted for it,  Paul said at a press conference alongside his House conservative colleagues.  That s what we should do again. You have to get rid of ObamaCare completely,  Jordan added. Paul stated in an interview earlier today that this GOP bill  will not pass,  and that  conservatives aren t gonna to take it.  However Paul and Jordan face an uphill struggle as GOP leadership, including that of President Donald Trump, seem to believe the bill to be a solid plan. We re going to do something that s great. And I am proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives,  Trump said of the bill.  It follows the guidelines I laid out in my congressional address. This will be a plan where you can choose your doctor and this will be a plan where you can choose your plan. And you know what the plan is. This is the plan.

"Mar 8, 2016","There are no surprises with the results on the Republican side tonight. Michigan and Mississippi went for Trump.BUT the Democrat results coming in tonight are surprising for many reasons. The most shocking is that Bernie Sanders is leading Hillary Clinton in Michigan by a little over 3%:Clinton has maintained a double-digit lead in nearly all polls of Michigan, the party s second-biggest state in terms of delegates to vote so far. But Sanders has visited the state repeatedly in recent weeks, believing its economically hard-hit areas should be receptive to his message of combating economic inequality. If he can pull out a surprise victory, his campaign team believes, it will quiet the naysayers questioning his viability after Clinton s sweeping wins in last week s Super Tuesday contests. It would also allow him to argue that he s a truly national candidate, while most of Clinton s big victory s have been in the south.Another shocking item is that exit polls in Michigan said 60% of Democrats believe Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy Wow! That s a crazy exit poll!Michigan Presidential Primaries ResultsOverall Michigan Presidential Primaries Results Democratic 36.7% Reporting B. Sanders 51.7% 217,424 H.

Interesting because Hillary is losing to Bernie right now. Could those crossover votes been the demise of Hillary in Michigan?DETROIT   Hillary Clinton swept to a widely-expected early victory in Mississippi on Tuesday, but all eyes were on Michigan as polls started to close there at 8 p.m. and Bernie Sanders jumped to a small early lead.The Vermont senator   whose campaign has long seen Michigan as a strategically important state   held a tight margin over the former secretary of state, but very few results were in from Wayne County, the home of Detroit, where Clinton is likely to perform well. Clinton s victory in Mississippi, a heavily African-American southern state, was called as soon as polls closed, following the pattern set by her easy wins across the south starting with South Carolina in February. Bernie Sanders barely competed in Mississippi, choosing to focus on the other state voting on Tuesday.Neither Clinton nor Sanders were in Michigan Tuesday night, but their absence doesn t imply indifference. Both candidates have campaigned hard in the state   Sanders for the chance to gain ground on the former secretary of state, and Clinton to close the door on his candidacy with a win in a competitive, delegate-rich state.Initial exit polling in Michigan showed just over three-fifths of Democratic voters believed both candidates  policies are about right on the ideological scale, according to ABC News. About 60 percent of voters said Clinton was honest and trustworthy, versus about 80 percent who said the same of Sanders. And around 60 percent said honesty or empathy was the most important attribute for a candidate   slightly more than the four-in-10 who said electability or experience was most important.Read more: Politico",SHOCKING POLL RESULTS In Primary Victories Tonight

Sadly, there are a large number of students who have bought into the whole  Peter Pan and the  I m never growing up  thing Remember these clowns who wore signs around their necks bemoaning the amount of money they WILLINGLY borrowed to pay for their education as a reason Americans should vote for Bernie? Per a survey of 500 college co-eds, LendEDU found that 31% of students, or roughly 2.4 million kids, admitted to using student loan money to fund their binge drinking trips to Cancun and Daytona Beach for spring break.According to the LendEDU poll, 30.60% of college students with student debt claim that they are using money they received from student loans to help pay for their spring break trip this year. For reference, you can use student loan funding for living expenses.The National Center for Education Statistics calculated that 20.5 million students will be attending college this year in the United States. Orbitz reported that 55% of students will be going on spring break. Using this data, we can roughly calculate that 11,275,000 students will be going on spring break this year.Factoring in our data, and assuming the claims made in our survey are accurate, this means that 2.38 million students are using money received from student loans to pay for their spring break excursion this year.Adding insult to injury, 24% of students admitted to using their student loan money for alcohol and 7% use those federally-subsidized checks for drugs.Nearly a quarter (23.80%) of respondents stated that they have used money received from student loans to pay for drinking some type of alcohol. This answer also included spending money at bars.A third (33.40%) of students answered that they have used money received from student loans to pay for clothing and other accessories.Similarly, the same amount (33.40%) of students said that they have used money received from student loans to pay for restaurants and take-out.6.60% of respondents responded saying that they have used money received from student loans to pay for drugs.Finally, 5.60% of students that participated in our survey stated that they used money received from student loans on gambling or sports betting.

"March 1, 2016","The hosts of a racist, white nationalist radio show say that they were given official press credentials by Donald Trump s presidential campaign. Even worse, the show says that they were given access to Donald Trump, Jr. and recorded a 20 minute interview with him.The program is called  The Political Cesspool,  and has a considerable history and record of promoting white supremacist ideas and concepts.Political Cesspool radio host James Edwards wrote on his blog that he attended a Donald Trump rally in Memphis on Saturday night as a fully credentialed member of the media and enjoyed the unique experience of being able to air a live broadcast of The Political Cesspool Radio Program from inside the press pen while the event was in full swing. The host said that the interview with the younger Trump will be posted on their website on Saturday.He also bragged that Trump is the first Republican nominee he plans to vote for. After getting an official press pass, the white nationalists were given access to the press area of Trump s campaign rally. Edwards wrote,  After getting my start in politics with Pat Buchanan in 2000, Donald Trump will be the first Republican nominee that I have ever voted for. Buchanan was a man ahead of the times and Trump is his vindicator. Pat Buchanan is of course the former Nixon operative and NBC contributor who has written books excusing the Holocaust and praising Hitler.The Political Cesspool radio show has in the past argued that  interracial sex is white genocide  and  slavery is the greatest thing that ever happened to  black people.Trump recently triggered a national outcry by refusing to disavow or deny an endorsement from white nationalist and former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke in an interview with CNN host Jake Tapper. After being slammed for the failure to distance himself from a notorious racist, Trump concocted the claim that he was having problems with his earpiece and didn t hear the question.He made no such indication during the interview, and in fact repeated the terms  David Duke  and  white supremacist.

"March 1, 2017","When people go to the voting booth, they expect certain values to be represented when they pull the lever for someone with a (D) next to his or her name. If a candidate for office says (s)he is a Democrat, we expect that person to be pro-choice and in favor of equal rights for women, pro-LGBTQ rights, pro-criminal justice reform, in favor of raising taxes on the rich, in favor of unions and workers  rights, and in favor of comprehensive immigration reform, among other things. However, this is not always how things shake out. Case in point  West Virginia  Democrat  Joe Manchin.Manchin voted in favor of racist Jeff Sessions for Attorney General, bucking Democratic values of the defense of equal rights for all. He has also been staunchly against equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. That is just for starters, too. Manchin has consistently voted with Republicans in the Senate more than he has voted with those of his own party, and at Donald Trump s first address to a joint session of Congress, he could be seen cozying up to the bigoted president, and hopping to his feet with a standing ovation during the speech at every chance. At the end of it, he eagerly went to shake hands and kiss Trump s ass, rather than standing in solidarity with #RESISTANCE   minded Democrats.Liberal pundits and bloggers are not the only ones noticing Joe Manchin s bizarre, Republican-like behavior, either. Right-wingers believe he is just doing this stuff in order to make sure that his deep-red state re-elects him in 2018. West Virginia GOP Chair Conrad Lucas says of what Manchin is doing: It is obvious that West Virginia was the most pro-Trump state and Joe Manchin was a steadfast supporter of Hillary Clinton since Day One of the 2016 campaign and he is up for re-election in 2016, so he is going to do everything he can to mask his past. But I think voters in West Virginia are much smarter than falling for Joe Manchin. However, liberals have a different   and likely more accurate   theory of Manchin s true leanings. Progressive Change Campaign Co-Chair Adam Green Committee says: Senate Democrats running for re-election in red states will lose their general elections if they don t inspire independent voters and the Democratic base. To win in 2018, he needs to be more in touch with the times and stand up more strongly to Trump and his team of billionaires and bankers. Adam Green is correct. Someone needs to primary Manchin and defeat him. He is doing the bidding of Republicans and Donald Trump in the Senate under the guise of being a Democrat. He isn t   he s just a DINO, a wolf in sheep s clothing. I wouldn t be surprised if it turned out he voted for Trump once he was in the privacy of the voting booth.Look at candidates, not just party, folks.

Now, the company has once again angered the public  but for a much more noble cause.This time, McDonald s is taking hits from anti-gay religious groups that are absolutely fuming after McDonald s Taiwan posted an LGBT-friendly advertisement for McCafe onto its Facebook page.The ad, which features a young man coming out to his father, is 90 seconds of pure emotion, capturing a moment that is extremely scary and heart-wrenching for many LGBT youth and adults. In the ad, the young man passes a coffee cup to his father that says,  I like boys.  The father gets upset and jumps up from the table, leaving his son alone and fighting back tears. A few seconds later the father returns, picks up the same cup of coffee and writes on it  I accept that you like boys, as translated by the Shanghaiist.Watch the subtitled ad called  Acceptance  below:The ad touched the hearts of many and went viral, with over 3.6 million views, more than 92,000 likes and thousands of shares. Unfortunately, not everyone enjoyed or appreciated the ad s accepting and equality-driven message. Chang Shou-yi, the secretary general of the Alliance of Taiwan Religious Groups for the Protection of Family, is actually calling for a boycott on the restaurant after seeing the ad. Shou-yi said: Because McDonald s is frequented by many children, it is especially important to oppose the promotion of same-sex behavior. The secretary general added that the religious group  rebukes and boycotts all enterprises that are polluting the next generation. Now, even if you want to just take a leak at a McDonald s bathroom, you can t help but feel polluted.

But the hypocrisy doesn t end there, apparently. Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, issued his own statement on the jobs report, and in doing so, he brought Republican hypocrisy to a whole new level.The February 2016 jobs report, which, of course, came out under Obama, showed 242,000 new jobs. Brady said: While it s good news that more Americans have joined the labor force, it s disappointing to see so little growth in full time work and wages. One year later, we have a jobs report that says 238,000 new jobs were created in February. Brady said: This is a great report. The fact that hundreds of thousands more people found new jobs last month is a good sign that our economy is moving in the right direction. Isn t 238,000 less than 242,000? Or is there some kind of new math of which we aren t yet aware? Really, partisan games and fuzzy math are the only explanation for Brady s saying he s very pleased about last month s jobs report   it s obviously because there s a Republican in the White House and Brady wants to kiss his ass.It also showcases Republicans  insistence on opposing everything that Obama ever did.Brady should have thought this out a little better.

Both CEO Steven Nardizzi, and COO, Al Giordano were terminated by the board of directors, following an internal audit.The organization has been the subject of rumors and accusations for a number of years, many of which were focused on the higher-than-average salaries paid to Wounded Warrior Project executives, along with questions about the amount of money the charity spends on fundraising.While other veterans charities spend as much as 98 percent of money raised on veterans, the Wounded Warrior Project only spends about 60 percent. According to the CBS report, anywhere from 40 to 50 percent of money raised by the Wounded Warrior Project goes to staff and fundraising, instead of veterans.If that s bad enough, the charity may not use the small percentage of funds it does spend on veterans in the way you might think.The Wounded Warrior Project claims some 56,000 veterans as  alumni,  veterans who have registered with the organization.But according to The Daily Beast, many of the veterans counted as  alumni  in 2014 had no contact with the organization during that year. Just 62 percent of so-called  alumni  of the Wounded Warrior Project had participated in even one activity in 2014.As The Daily Beast reports here, Ken Davis, a veteran who served in Iraq before being injured, is considered among the  alumni  of the Wounded Warrior Project even though he said he no longer wants to be associated with it. Davis told The Daily Beast, I receive more marketing stuff from them, [and see more of that] than the money they ve put into the community here in Arizona. It s just about numbers and money to them. Never once did I get the feeling that it s about veterans. He is not the only veteran to report this experience. As Addicting Info reported here, Courtney Leigh Schumacher reached out to the Wounded Warrior Project when her husband lost both his legs in the line of duty.Rather than answer her requests for help with the things her family needed, the Wounded Warrior Project sent her a lot of useless stuff, including  hats, stickers, magnets, clothing and backpacks,  all displaying the organization s logo.There s no doubt that firing Nardizzi and Giordano is a step in the right direction.Yet that step alone may not be enough to fix the charity s negative image, or restore the trust of veterans and the public.Here s more on this story via CBS News:Image credit: video screen capture via CBS News"," Rocked By Scandal, Wounded Warrior Project Fires Top Execs (VIDEO)"

It really doesn t get much larger than Republicans telling people that they can t discuss a 100% legal and constitutional medical procedure because it offends their religious sensibilities.The best part about this is that these clinics are not regulated so they can say any damn thing they want (expect anything about abortion, apparently). They can lie about abortions causing cancer. They can lie and show a picture of a baby in its third trimester and say that s what it looks like after 6 weeks. Raw Story also mentions that they lie about the effectiveness of condoms and claim birth control causes. Why? Because they don t give a damn about the woman, they only care about getting her pregnant and keeping that way.This dangerous ploy has not gone unnoticed: We re going to give $2m out to organizations not even licensed by the State of Georgia to provide medical care in any way?  said Staci Fox, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast.  If this is really about providing access to women, shouldn t we be concerned about who it is that is giving that access?

Virginia Supreme Court decision in 1967 effectively made interracial marriage legal, and forbade discrimination on the grounds of disagreement and bigotry against such marriages. This is the year 2016, so you d think this would be an issue that is in the dustbins of history at this point, right? Wrong. Kentucky is taking us all back to the dark days of legalized segregation and racial discrimination, as their state legislature is currently advancing a bill that would legalize discrimination against interracial couples. The bill, called SB 180, says in part: Protected activities  means actions by people commissioned, employed, hired, retained, or otherwise used by the public or the government to provide customized, artistic, expressive, creative, ministerial, or spiritual goods or services, or judgments, attestations, or other commissions that involve protected rights;  Protected activity provider  means a person who provides protected activities; and  Protected rights  means the rights of persons to be free from governmental actions that impair, impede, infringe upon, or otherwise restrict the exercise of any right guaranteed by the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Kentucky, including but not limited to a person s right of conscience, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and right to peaceable assembly.So in other words, if your boss is a racist and finds out your spouse is of a different race from you, he can fire you. The bill is obviously aimed LGBT people, but it is so broadly worded that at this point, it could mean literally anything   including and especially related to interracial dating and marriage. The worst part of it all is that these people can hide behind  religious beliefs  to discriminate, and there is no provision in the bill for legal recourse on the part of the victims of this discrimination.And if you think this won t happen, think again. There are still PLENTY of people who oppose  race mixing  and anything they perceive to be against the bible in that arena. This will truly turn back the clock on civil rights like we ve never seen before if this horrendous bill becomes law.Featured image via Wikipedia"," KY Goes Back To The ’50s, Advances Bill To Discriminate Against Interracial Couples"
"March 13, 2017","Republicans seem to be steadfast in their quest to destroy the Affordable Care Act despite all the facts showing that doing so will be devastating not only to the millions of Americans who rely on the law to have access to affordable coverage but also to the economy.The Congressional Budget Office has just come out and said that not only would 14 million lose coverage by next year under Trumpcare, but by 2021, 21 million will lose insurance, and then by 2026, 24 million.And yet, there are still Republicans and those who support them who insist on repealing Obamacare and replacing it with the subpar version known as Trumpcare. So, for the visual learners out there who can t quite seem to grasp how horrific this all is, the Wall Street Journal made a graph to show how drastic this loss of coverage will be.Here s the image:The projected percentage of uninsured Americans under the House GOP plan vs. Obamacare: https://t.co/zOSvG99BmU pic.twitter.com/cbv37xVQs4  Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) March 13, 2017While the new bill would seemingly reduce the deficit over time, it leaves behind tens of millions of Americans who will no longer have access to care. And when people can t afford care, they go to the emergency room, and when they can t pay their bills, taxpayers end up picking up the tab. The spending will always be there. It s just whether or not you want to spend money for people to stay healthy or wait until they are in such dire straits that they need emergency care and are willing to go bankrupt because of it.All in all   it s heartless.

"March 14, 2016","Once again, the police demonstrate just how absolutely justified people of color are in not trusting them. After the violence and chaos that erupted and eventually resulted in the cancellation of a Donald Trump rally in Chicago, Illinois on Friday night, some extremely vulgar and racist language was used between police officers just hours later over their dispatch radios. Very clearly, on the tape that has been circulating on social media, the phrases Typical f ing n s  and Black lives matter, my a  are spat maliciously by two of Chicago s finest. The disturbing words were uttered over the feeds from the Far South Side and Morgan Park areas   both of which are populated mostly by African Americans.Here is a description of the vile exchange, via New York Daily News:The roughly 8:30 a.m. exchange started with a dispatcher joking with a police officer that it was  too early to be bothering you.  They said a friendly good morning to each other.Another cop asked,  How many boyfriends do you have? The dispatcher replied with a joke.  Why you all in my Kool-Aid? Why you over here? Another voice said,  You can answer that again,  and a muffled voice said something that sounded like,  You got busted over the air again. Two seconds later, a man s voice said,  Typical f ing n s. A police officer asked the dispatcher to  find out what radio that comment came from  and she said she couldn t track its location but had alerted her boss.A few indecipherable noises followed before another voice said the ethnic slur again. Black lives matter, my a . F ing n s,  the voice said. The minute-long recording then ended.You can listen here:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/251822805  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Now, of course, the Chicago Police Department is in full on damage control mode. They have reduced this extreme racism to inappropriate transmission on a police frequency  and released the following statement: The statements made are absolutely unacceptable and Superintendent [John] Escalante has ordered an immediate internal affairs investigation into this incident,  CPD officials said.  Should the investigation reveal that a member of the police department made the statements, he will be immediately suspended and disciplinary proceedings will be launched. Considering that it was over police dispatch, it is highly unlikely that anyone BUT a Chicago police officer or someone else who has access to that feed in such a position said it. Further, forget suspended   fire these people once they are identified. They obviously cannot police neighborhoods for people of color in a fair and unbiased way. Don t we have enough issues with police racism? Don t we have enough racist cops using their position to literally murder people of color? Shame on you, Chicago PD, if you allow these racists to keep their jobs. Then again, with the way things usually go in these cases, I won t be surprised if nobody is disciplined at all, let alone fired as they should be.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons ", Chicago Cops Busted Yelling ‘F**king N***gers’ On Hot Dispatch Mic (AUDIO)
"March 14, 2017","The former mayor of Fairfax City in Virginia is facing up to 40 years in prison after he pled guilty to trading crystal meth for sex. Richard  Scott  Silverthorne entered a guilty plea to one charge of distributing methamphetamine on Monday.This shocking story began in August of 2016 when Silverthorne was arrested. Police say they got a tip that he was using a website to set up casual sexual encounters and distribute meth. An undercover officer set up a fake profile on the site and Silverthorne took the bait. In just days he had responded to the undercover officer and arranged to meet him at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in McLean, Virginia. The police set up a sting operation and busted him when he gave the undercover cop two grams of meth. During the raid, police arrested Silverthorne and two other men.Silverthorne was released on his own recognizance last August and had remained free since then. It was expected that he would be released today to await his sentencing hearing, but instead, he was sent to jail. Reports say that there were  audible gasps  in the courtroom when the judge made the announcement.His sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 9. He could receive a maximum of 40 years behind bars and a hefty $500,000 fine. However, his attorney, Brian Drummond, says he is hopeful that Silverthorne will get time served and be placed on probation because of the decades he has spent as a public servant with no criminal record.Before he was caught trading drugs for sex, Silverthorne had been re-elected as Fairfax City Mayor. He was also a substitute teacher who worked in the Fairfax County Public Schools. After he was arrested, a special election was held in February of 2017 to replace him.You can watch more on this story here, via ABC7: Featured image via video screen capture", Former Virginia Mayor Could Get 40 Years After Pleading Guilty To Trading Meth For Sex (VIDEO)
"March 15, 2016","Republican front-runner Donald Trump has caused a lot of outrage since stepping into the race for the White House, and with good reason. The billionaire is the worst person to run for the highest office since white supremacist George Wallace in 1968. But for all the anger he has caused, he s also given comedians a whole lot of material. The latest comedian to capitalize on the Trump train wreck is Russell Brand and it is hilarious.Brand has long been a champion of economic and social justice in both the United States and the U.K. The comedian often speaks out about politics and once said: I have never voted. Like most people I am utterly disenchanted by politics. Like most people I regard politicians as frauds and liars and the current political system as nothing more than a bureaucratic means for furthering the augmentation and advantages of economic elites. Although, I don t agree with him not taking advantage of his right to vote in the U.K., I do agree that lots of people have become disenchanted with politics. Actually, part of the reason Donald Trump has risen to the top of the GOP race is because he isn t part of the  establishment  and his imbecilic fan club believes he is honest   but, I digress.Brand has a successful v-blog called The Trew News which has unfortunately been on hiatus for the last six months. However, on Tuesday, the comedian surprised us all by posting a short new video online where he absolutely pummels Trump. In the video titled  Trump   Pixar-Hitler or aged-baby?  Brand says: I like him cause he s like a big rich baby. I just want to breastfeed him. Come here you silly c*nt, have a bit of t*t-milk. He is like a giant, rich baby and he proves it every time he lashes out at people who do not give him what he wants. He d be a disaster for this country and everyone knows it, even comedians from other countries. We are a laughingstock all over the world thanks to him and all the dumbasses who support him.Watch the rest of Brand s remarks in his video: Featured image via Instagram", Comedian Russell Brand DESTROYS Trump In Hilarious Stand-Up Routine (VIDEO)
"March 15, 2017","Rand Paul is a self-described libertarian, but his idea for how to fix our healthcare system sounds awfully socialist. On the right, Paul has been one of the biggest critics of Trumpcare, calling it  Obamacare lite. What we think is being hidden from conservatives is there s a lot of  Obamacare Lite  in their bill,  the Kentucky Republican said on CNN s  New Day  Friday.  There s a new entitlement program.   There is also a Cadillac tax or something similar to the Cadillac tax that was in Obamacare. And there s also an individual mandate, believe it or not. Instead of paying the mandate to the government, they re going to tell you you have to pay the mandate, by law, to an insurance company. Paul, speaking at a Freedom Works rally, had his own proposal, which might as well have been an advertisement for the National Rifle Association. His suggestion is that people should be able to buy health insurance through the NRA.Here s the video: You see what he did there?The truth is, this isn t the worst idea in the world. The NRA is a sizable membership organization, but it s far from the biggest. The fact is, large groups people have a lot more clout than individuals. AAA has 40 million members, as compared to the NRA s 4.5. The AARP would probably be happy to negotiate with insurance companies and sell policies to their members.Inadvertently, though, the rabidly anti-union (but pro-gun) Republican, made the case for unions. Individuals don t have much if any negotiating power with insurance companies, or really, anyone. Still, Republicans want to leave individuals on their own, with the imagined idea that somehow, shopping is equivalent to negotiating. It s not. If you have the option to buy from six overpriced plans, you re still paying too much, but hey, you got a choice.The third largest membership organization in the world is a union. Unfortunately, you have to work for them to get the benefits of their negotiations, but if more people had access to unions, prices would drop across the board.But, there is one major problem with Paul s idea. Most employers, including most union employers, pick up at least part of the monthly tab. That s where the government subsidies that Republicans hate would come in. If an organization like AAA or even the NRA were to offer health insurance, it would still cost a lot more money than a decent employer plan, at least without some government help.Sorry, Republicans, but unions aren t synonymous with corruption anymore than the corporations that supply the paychecks, but they do give workers a voice, and in the case of goods and services, they give workers negotiating power. All free market Republicans should be behind more negotiating power, but the truth is, Republicans only want the market to be free for large corporations. All the rest of us should be at their mercy.Still, even at half bad, it s better than Trumpcare.Featured image via video screen capture", Rand Paul’s Solution For Healthcare Is Only Half Horrible (VIDEO)
"March 16, 2016","We definitely live in a rape culture, and one of the most infuriating parts of that is the huge backlog of untested rape kits around the country. For instance, after Detroit finally was taken to task regarding rape kits that sat for years in an old warehouse, more than 100 serial rapists were identified.Now, the state of Idaho is advancing a bill that is designed to force crime labs and law enforcement to clear the backlog and stop shifting rape kits to the back burner. However, there is one sheriff in that state who is not at all happy about that. In fact, Bingham County Sheriff Craig Rowland s comments on the matter are downright infuriating. He said: I really believe the Legislature needs to take a strong look at allowing law enforcement to do their job and not try to dictate what we need to do. I think they re trying to help, I really do. They need to let us decide if we re going to send the kit and when we send the kits in. Because the majority of our rapes, not to say that we don t have rapes, we do, but the majority of our rapes that are called in, are actually consensual sex. This is reminiscent of old Todd Akin s  legitimate rape  comments. What these idiots need to realize is that if ANYTHING sexual transpires that a partner wasn t okay with, and (s)he said to stop, THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF RAPE.Luckily, pressure was put on Rowland for his comments, and he at least attempted to apologize. However, the apology is now deleted from his Facebook page, so he likely didn t mean it anyway. It can be read at Jezebel.Rep. Melissa Wintrow took Rowland to task for his reckless remarks, saying: Many times people are focused on a woman s behavior, and the victim s response. when we should be thinking about what are we teaching men in this society. What are we teaching young boys and men about how we should not initiate or cross any physical boundary without consent. That s right. Stop blaming and not believing the victim.

"March 16, 2017","One of the arguments against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is that people are losing options as insurance companies are pulling out. That s true. Insurance companies are pulling out, but Republicans tell us it s because the law isn t viable and that insurance companies are leaving because they aren t making money. Well, a ruling from a federal judge just blew the lid off of that theory.The ruling, from Judge John D. Bates, a George W. Bush appointee, was in a case involving Aetna, who has pulled out of all but four of the states where they were part of the exchange. The claim was that they were losing money on the deal. Judge Bates found that that was a lie.Now a federal judge has ruled that that was a rank falsehood. In fact, says Judge John D. Bates, Aetna made its decision at least partially in response to a federal antitrust lawsuit blocking its proposed $34-billion merger with Humana. Aetna threatened federal officials with the pullout before the lawsuit was filed, and followed through on its threat once it was filed. Bates made the observations in the course of a ruling he issued Monday blocking the merger.Source: LA TimesThat pretty much eliminates one major talking point in the debate surrounding health insurance.The judge s conclusions about Aetna s real reasons for pulling out of Obamacare   as opposed to the rationalization the company made in public   are crucial for the debate over the fate of the Affordable Care Act. That s because the company s withdrawal has been exploited by Republicans to justify repealing the act. Just last week, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) cited Aetna s action on the  Charlie Rose  show, saying that it proved how shaky the exchanges were.In fact, the judge ruled, Aetna was profitable in some of the states but pulled out nonetheless just to make a point   a point that risked the lives or at least the health coverage of upwards of 20 million people. Bates believes that Aetna will start selling insurance in at least some of these markets again, so there goes the whole  Obamacare is imploding  idea.Clearly, not all insurers are lying to Americans. Kaiser Permanente loves the law. They ve even profited from it. The fact is that if they can do it, there s no reason other companies can t. All they have to do is cut back on the greed.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images", Federal Judge Blows Lid Off Trump’s Biggest Complaints About Obamacare
"March 17, 2016","During a United Nations Summit in New York City today focusing on women, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau explained why he is going to keep saying he is a feminist. I m going to keep saying loudly and clearly that I am a feminist, until it is met with a shrug,  said Trudeau.  Why does every time I say I m a feminist, the twitterverse explodes and news medias pick it up. It shouldn t be something that creates a reaction. It simply is saying, I believe in the equality of men and women and I believe that we still have an awful lot of work to do to get there.  Trudeau added,  It s just really, really obvious that we should be standing up for women s rights and trying to create more equal societies. Like, duh. Trudeau won election in October 2015 after a stunning comeback from third in the polls. He famously appointed an equal number of men and women in his cabinet, and cited his reasoning for doing so,  because it s 2015.  During the summit, he called on World leaders to follow Canada s lead when appointing their own cabinets. Any world leaders who tell me  I d love to, I just can t do that with the current configuration of our parliament or of my party , I say:  Well, what are you doing to change that configuration and draw out those extraordinary women who can be leaders that we need? ,  he told the crowd.His party, the Liberal Party, also recouped a majority in the Canadian Parliament. His election also inspired an increase of voter turnout by 7.4 percent to 68.5 percent. Trudeau won election on a campaign platform of progressive reforms, such as increasing taxes on the wealthy and dramatically improving infrastructure. Trudeau has also given warm welcomes to Syrian refugees arriving in Canada to seek asylum.Just last week, Trudeau met with President Barack Obama to promote ties between Canada and the United States, and to announce joint efforts to combat climate change.

"March 17, 2017","Fox News found themselves in a really uncomfortable position on Friday because of Donald Trump s gullibility.During a Fox News broadcast on Tuesday, Andrew Napolitano attempted to defend Trump s continuing insistence that President Obama wiretapped him by accusing the British intelligence agency GCHQ of wiretapping Trump after being ordered to do so by Obama.Just like Trump s original accusation, Napolitano s accusation was just as wild and baseless. Yet, White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer repeated it as gospel without providing any evidence to back up the claim.In a rare statement issued by the GCHQ, the agency angrily refuted the accusation. Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct  wiretapping  against the then president-elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored. The international incident reportedly forced Spicer and National Security Adviser McMaster to issue a formal apology to the United Kingdom, even though Spicer and Trump have not publicly backed away from the accusation in the United States.The embarrassing incident was rightfully brought up by reporters during a joint press conference on Friday attended by Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.When asked if the White House made a mistake blaming the British, Trump literally blamed his favorite propaganda network for the an accusation his team repeated, thus throwing them under the bus. Trump also had the audacity to claim his team made no such allegation even though his team openly repeated it as if it somehow proved Trump s original accusation. We said nothing,  Trump said.  All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox. So you shouldn t be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. Here s the video via Twitter.Wow. Trump to Merkel about alleged wiretapping by Obama:  At least we have something in common, perhaps.  She appears to be very confused. pic.twitter.com/la4p9ZJGvo  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017Almost immediately, Fox News rushed to reverse the damage as anchor Shep Smith told the world that Napolitano was full of shit. Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano s commentary,  Smith said.  Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now-President of the United States was surveilled at any time in any way. Full stop. And then Fox anchor Bret Baier chimed in later in the day by repeating that Napolitano s claim cannot be confirmed. We love the judge, we love him here at Fox, but the Fox News division was never able to back up those claims and was never reported on this show,  Baier reported.While Napolitano was irresponsible for pitching such an accusation, Donald Trump was even more irresponsible by letting Spicer repeat it without any verification of the accuracy of the claim. All Trump had to do is direct his team to make contact with British intelligence and ask if the claim is true or not. But Trump failed to do so because he is flailing for anything that could even suggest in the slightest that his accusation against President Obama is true. But the accusation is clearly false because if Trump really had any proof he would have released it by now. Even Republican leaders in Congress have confirmed that Trump s claim is a lie.So it looks like the honeymoon may be over between Trump and Fox News. It s probably safe to say that Fox News will put a leash on what their commentators say about Trump s wiretapping fiasco.

"March 18, 2016","New Hampshire republican Kyle Tasker resigned from the state House of Representatives after he was arrested on three felony drug charges, along with charges of soliciting a minor for sex.According to NECN, Tasker sent pornographic videos and messages to an undercover officer, who was posing as a 14-year-old girl online.Over the course of a six-week long investigation, police say the New Hampshire lawmaker offered the undercover cop drugs and asked for sexual favors.Some of Tasker s texts were written during committee meetings and sent from the state house.During an interview with NECN, Nottingham Police Chief Gunnar Foss said the investigation began after police became aware that Tasker had attempted to contact a minor online. We had information that he was attempting to contact a 14-year-old girl online, and that kicked in the Internet Crimes Against Children team. They were monitoring a lot of his stuff, and found out through his communications that there was a significant amount of drugs at his home. Tasker was arrested on March 1, and faces felony charges for the attempted solicitation of a minor.He is also facing three felony-level drug charges, after a search of his home turned up marijuana, hallucinogenic mushrooms and the prescription drug Suboxone. Police say the drugs were packaged for sale.Before his arrest, Tasker was a member of the state legislature s Committee on Children and Family Law, described as a body of lawmakers  which deals with all matters relating to children and youth, their rights, obligations, and protection and the application of criminal laws and sentencing for children. Tasker is the same New Hampshire lawmaker who got national attention in 2012, after he dropped a loaded gun during a meeting of the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee.In 2014, he made a series of offensive Facebook posts, which also drew national criticism.In one post Tasker suggested that he should be allowed to join the Black Caucus because he likes rap music.He also said he wished he could join a  white caucus of state legislators. In another post he made light of domestic violence, by joking about eating  battered women. When asked about Tasker s arrest, some New Hampshire lawmakers said they were not at all surprised by the drug charges, claiming that he often came to meetings smelling of pot and alcohol.When asked if Tasker s behavior was a poor reflection on state lawmakers, however, representatives placed the burden on the voters who elected him three times.

"March 19, 2016","Beginning in 2011, Republican-controlled states began setting up what they claim is a system to identify voters who have voted in more than one place.As reported on Democracy Now, at least 27 states began using an interstate  cross-checking system,  which identifies voters whose names appear on the voter rolls in more than one state.Investigative reporter Greg Palast was able to access the list of flagged voters, which has now grown to include more than seven million names.As Palast explains during a recent episode of Redacted Tonight, not a single person whose name appears on the list of flagged voters has been prosecuted for voter fraud.In fact, none of the people whose names have been removed from the voting rolls for  suspected voter fraud  has even been reported for further investigation.That s because Republicans know that this system does not identify people who are voting multiple times, as they claim it does.After reviewing the list firsthand, Palast discovered that it is made up of voters who have very common names; for example, Joe Smith.While it would be surprising if a name like Joe Smith didn t appear multiple times on several state voter rolls, the system flags any voter who  appears to be registered twice.  Worse, it even flags voters who may have the same first and last name as another person, but an entirely different middle name.Not surprisingly, the interstate cross-check system overwhelmingly impacts minority and Democratic voters.During a March 10, 2016 interview with Lee Camp, Palast described the likely impact of the interstate  crosscheck  system on the 2016 election.Watch the interview below:Palast first began sounding the alarm over inaccuracies in the interstate  crosscheck  system in 2014.A thirty-minute special report titled  Jim Crow Returns: Interstate  Crosscheck  Program threatens Millions of Voters,  provides a closer look at the list of voters who have been impacted by the bogus system.Watch the full report below, via Greg Palast on YouTube:Millions of voters are likely to be kicked from the voter rolls between now and November, if they haven t been already.One of the most important things voters can do to protect their voting rights is regularly check their status as a registered voter.As we get closer to the general election, republicans will step up their efforts to disenfranchise as many democratic voters as possible.Lee Camp s third video in the series Seven Ways To Beat The Ballot Bandits drives the point home:Go here to find out what else you can do to preserve and protect your vote.Image credit: video screen capture via Greg Palast on youtube", How Republicans Plan To Steal The 2016 Election (VIDEO)

The alleged president s  swamp  now has a Russian accent, with some in his administration revealed to have ties to the hostile foreign government. And that  some  may include Trump himself. On top of that, Trump has been pushing for a travel ban, while initially seeking to stop travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. That executive order was so chaotic that travelers were still in mid-flight when he signed it, then detained at airports. His second attempt to ban Muslims failed in court after he watered it down to forbidding travelers from six countries from entering the U.S. And now Trump is pushing through a health care plan which gifts the rich with tax breaks and hits the elderly hard with pricier coverage. Trump s first meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel was so awkward that it was obvious he cannot sit in a room with actual world leaders without embarrassing the rest of us.Meanwhile, Trump is on another vacay at his Mar-a-Lago resort while trying to take away healthcare from 24 million Americans.Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images", Trump’s Approval Rating TANKS To The Lowest Level Of Any President’s First 60 Days
"March 2, 2016","They whined and fear mongered, but in the end, Republicans had to sit and watch as Oregon took action to help struggling workers make a fair living.On Wednesday, Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed a bill into law raising the state minimum wage to the highest in the country, but in a unique way that takes into consideration the differences between urban and rural business growth.According to The Oregonian:The bill gives Oregon the highest statewide minimum wage rates in the nation, to $14.75 inside Portland s urban growth boundary, $13.50 in midsize counties and $12.50 in rural areas by 2022.The law was agreed upon by labor unions and businesses in a compromise that should stand as proof that both sides can work together for the common good of the hardworking people who are trying to feed and cloth their families.Governor Brown expressed pride at what Oregon Democrats have achieved for families across the state with the help of unions and businesses. I am extremely proud of the collaborative spirit of the stakeholder groups that worked to develop this legislation. Oregon has not only avoided a number of potentially problematic ballot measures, we have taken a very smart approach in a way that makes sense for workers and for businesses no matter where in Oregon they are. On Facebook, Brown wrote that the new law will  ensure hard-working Oregonians get a much-needed raise in order to keep up with rising costs of rent, food, and other necessities. Even President Obama praised the new wage hike in a statement via the White House, and called upon Congress to do the same for the rest of the nation.I commend the Oregon Legislature and Governor Kate Brown for taking action to raise their state s minimum wage. Since I first called on Congress to increase the federal minimum wage in 2013, 18 states and the District of Columbia have acted on their own. These efforts will boost the paychecks of hardworking Americans and help support millions of workers trying to make ends meet. Today, more than half of our states guarantee their workers a wage higher than the federal minimum. That s progress. But Congress needs to keep up with the rest of the country. They need to act, and finally give America a raise. And until they do, I ll continue to encourage states, cities, counties and companies to act on their own to support hardworking families.This is a great day for Oregon workers, who must be a little more excited than usual to go to work now that they know they ll be taking home much more needed income to provide for themselves and their families.The same cannot be said for most of Republican-controlled Alabama and other red states. Republicans there recently passed a law banning counties and cities from increasing the minimum wage within their own boundaries, making clear that they have no intention of raising the minimum wage in that state for the foreseeable future.So while people in Oregon can have hope that the future will be financially brighter, people in Alabama are struck and that s why it doesn t make sense for people to vote for Republicans.

"March 2, 2017","Madeleine Albright, who served as Secretary of State under Bill Clinton, has something to say about Trump and his immigration and foreign policy positions. Trump, as we all know, is in love with the idea that only he and his policies can protect us from ISIS. However, real international diplomats know that s not true, and Albright said so on a podcast with former Obama strategist David Axelrod.Albright just came right out and said it: If this   anti-immigrant rhetoric and the executive order that came out was supposed to protect us, it has done the opposite. Frankly, it s a great recruiting tool for ISIS. We already know that ISIS has used Trump in recruiting videos, but what Albright says is that Trump is destroying any incentive that Iraqis and other Middle Easterners might have to help us, as opposed to helping ISIS or doing nothing at all. Trump s Muslim ban doesn t just alienate them, it also makes it a lot more difficult to gather intelligence from the region. We need cooperation for intelligence-gathering, but why should they help us when we re openly calling them the enemy via our immigration policies?Albright also said that she believes Trump and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, are actually hostile to Europe while being overly friendly to Russia. That, too, can serve as recruitment for ISIS and other terrorist groups, if for no other reason than it demonstrates how fickle we are, and how unlikely to keep our promises and back up our allies we are.Trump claimed he could beat ISIS inside of 30 days (although he didn t say which 30-day period he was talking about). If nothing else, he s said that we have to beef up our military strength, and implied that we need to ally with whoever we can (even former enemies) in order to beat them.Albright is right, and Trump is putting us in danger. All his anti-immigrant, nationalist rhetoric does is galvanize everyone who already felt alienated by our foreign policy. That includes Muslims, particularly those living here in the U.S. We are not safer under Trump, and ISIS knows that.Featured image by Aude Guerrucci via Getty Images"," Former Secretary Of State Drops MASSIVE Shocker On Trump’s Foreign Policy, And He’ll DESPISE It"
"March 20, 2016","Trump s spokeswoman Katrina Pierson isn t known for being the brightest crayon in the box. She once went on air wearing a necklace made of bullets to show how committed the Trump campaign is to upholding the second amendment at all costs, for instance. Well, she s back now, and this time she is defending her crazy boss and his even crazier supporters and their violent tendencies.Chances are, these days, if there s a Donald Trump rally, there is violence. So, of course, when being interviewed, Pierson and other workers on the Trump campaign are asked to denounce this behavior. Of course, they never do, though. On Sunday, Pierson appeared on Fox and was asked about the escalating violence at Trump rallies. Host Jeannine Pirro wondered aloud if the entire Trump show   the violence the protests, all of it   were anarchy, or perhaps some kind of game to get a specific candidate nominated. Pierson s response was predictably stupid: I think a lot of it is anarchy, but I think more importantly this is organized chaos. They are trying to create a public perception of violence to scare people [away from] supporting Mr. Trump. She then went on to make the ridiculous assertion that conservative values have been absent in the community  since the days of GOP favorite Ronald Reagan, and ever since it has been a free for all for the militant left in this political [sic] correct society where it s okay for them to use violence as an intimidation tactic or just yell  racist  or  Hitler  to smear someone s character. Pirro then hit Pierson with something she can t stand: facts (shocking, coming from a Fox host, I know). She reminded the spokeswoman that there were no protests and no violence at the rallies and speeches of the other GOP presidential hopefuls. Pierson chose to ignore this and say: You have people like MoveOn.org and Black Lives Matter and some of these anarchy groups, that s all they do is look for fights. They ve been provoking people all over the country long before Mr. Trump entered this race. Pierson went on to give the ominous warning that Trump s supporters would only be emboldened by those who try to plot to stop him from getting the GOP 2016 nomination, saying: This is the American people having a head-on collision with the truth, which is that the Democratic side is not on the side of the people, and the militant left is their army. And what we re seeing now is that people supporting Mr. Trump, they re not afraid. They re going to go out there and they re going to fight for American values and American families because that s who needs to come first. This woman is just another example of how ridiculous   but also dangerous   Trump, his supporters, and his campaign are.

"March 21, 2016","President Barack Obama singlehandedly caused a collective right-wing freak out on Monday when he took a picture in front of a Cuban ministry building that just happened to have a Che Guevara mural.Obama has been in Cuba since Sunday, making the trip a truly historic three day visit because a sitting U.S. president hasn t visited the country in 88 years. During the trip, Obama is accompanied by his family and dozens of American politicians and business leaders who are aiding the President in a crucial initiative to build a bridge between the U.S. and Cuba   two countries that have had political differences for decades. This photograph (along with many others) was taken as Obama was taking part in a wreath laying ceremony with several other officials in Havana s Revolution Plaza.Obamas s cause was noble, but as soon as word got out about the photograph, conservative websites didn t hesitate to start bashing the President for posing in front of the image of the Cuban Marxist revolutionary leader. The Drudge Report was one of the first, throwing up the photo on their site and captioning it with  Mission Accomplished. Drudge ReportTownhall.com called the photo a  gem of a picture,  and The Washington Examiner said the image had created a  fresh wave of fury.  The outrage continued on social media, as conservatives on Twitter unleashed an avalanche of accusations and insults. One user called Obama  a disgrace  while another criticized the President for posing with Che Guevara s image but not going to Navy SEAL Chris Kyle s memorial service in 2013.TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterConservatives have been slamming Obama ever since he stepped foot in Cuba yesterday, obviously because they are more in favor of hostile, divisive relations than the mutual understanding and respect that the President is trying to create.

"March 21, 2017","Republican members of Congress, who love claiming that they re the only party that stands for real Americans, are now terrified of their own constituents. This is happening for one simple reason   they never expected their own constituents to be angry with what they re doing on Capitol Hill. So instead of facing the music and admitting that the entire GOP platform is something Americans don t want, they re running scared.Such is the case with Idaho representative Raul Labrador. His office had the audacity to file a complaint against a group of people made up primarily of senior citizens because they were showing up at his office in Lewiston on a weekly basis to voice their displeasure with him and the GOP. Labrador obviously considers this a threat, and perhaps, if they d threatened violence it would be.But that s not what s happening. Chris Ankeny, the chief of police in Lewiston, the Idaho town where this is taking place, says these people were protesting in front of Labrador s offices and that no crimes had been committed. Employees are uncomfortable with them because of the national attention this group had garnered, not because of credible (or even in-credible) threats.Labrador s office contacted the D.C. Capitol Police over this because that force has jurisdiction over U.S. Congresspeople s offices in addition to Capitol Hill. They did so because they felt the Lewiston department wasn t doing anything. The thing is, a good police department won t do anything when they confirm that there s no crime happening (including threats). So what this is is an office full of people who can t handle dissent.The worst part is that this group has so many seniors, and Labrador won t hear them. These are people who may be worried about cuts to programs they depend on, including Medicare and Meals on Wheels. Others living in and around Lewiston are worried about climate change and clean energy. They say Labrador s absence from his offices is a sign of cowardice, and they re not wrong. He is a coward.Many Republicans have run away and hidden from their constituents lately because they can t tolerate the fact that their constituents  concerns run counter to the GOP s platform. They re too used to putting party above country. Maybe this is uncharted territory for them, but shouldn t these guys, who work for the very people they re pissing off, actually stop to listen?Or are they not what they ve been trying to sell to us?It s really disgusting that Labrador s office feels so threatened by non-violent, non-threatening protests from senior citizens that they ve had to file a complaint.Featured image by Gage Skidmore.

"March 22, 2016","It s long been said that the  War on Drugs  is a fiction created by certain interests in society, in order to attack particular segments of the American population. There s been plausible deniability for a while, but now the truth is revealed by someone who was there when it was engineered.Harper s ran a piece written by Dan Baum, who was writing in support of drug legalization, in which a very honest and completely damning quote was given by former Nixon policy advisor John Ehrlichman. The quote will give even the most ardent anti-drug naysayers pause when they realize that the whole  war on drugs  that they ve completely bought into is a total lie.The quote is below:At the time, I was writing a book about the politics of drug prohibition. I started to ask Ehrlichman a series of earnest, wonky questions that he impatiently waved away.  You want to know what this was really all about?  he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect.  The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I m saying? We knew we couldn t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did. I must have looked shocked. Ehrlichman just shrugged. Then he looked at his watch, handed me a signed copy of his steamy spy novel, The Company, and led me to the door.Source: JezebelThis false war has been carried on for decades by subsequent presidents, as a useful tool to continue suppressing anti-establishment segments of society. Just look at Ronald Reagan s crack  epidemic.  Former CIA officials have come forth to admit the drug was funneled into black neighborhoods as a form of social sabotage. It also provided an excuse for brutal over policing and mass incarceration of a majority of their young people for a growing profitable prison industrial complex.Baum also goes on to explain a huge reason why Republicans are so strongly against the legalization of marijuana, despite its obvious success:The citizens of the U.S. jurisdictions that legalized marijuana may have set in motion more machinery than most of them had imagined.  Without marijuana prohibition, the government can t sustain the drug war,  Ira Glasser, who ran the American Civil Liberties Union from 1978 to 2001, told me.  Without marijuana, the use of drugs is negligible, and you can t justify the law-enforcement and prison spending on the other drugs. Their use is vanishingly small. I always thought that if you could cut the marijuana head off the beast, the drug war couldn t be sustained. Source: JezebelWith the legalization of marijuana, a process has been started in America that would bring an end to a long-used secret Nixonian tool that was used for decades to attack liberal progressive and minority communities. This is exactly why Republicans are so strongly against it. It s time for this secret war on America by the right-wing to come to a permanent end.Featured image via Flickr", Former Nixon Aid Reveals Why The ‘War On Drugs’ Was Created — The Reason Will Make You Sick
"March 22, 2017","Women should get as far away from Oklahoma as soon as possible because Christian Sharia law is about to make their lives a living hell.If Oklahoma state GOP Rep. George Faught has his way, rape will be on the path to being legal in the state. At least that s what rapists are hoping for after Faught made a frightening statement on the subject during a debate on House Bill 1549, which restricts abortion.Democratic Rep. Cory Williams masterfully cornered Faught during the hearing by asking him if he believes rape and incest are the  will of God  since the legislation has no exceptions for either, meaning women would be forced to give birth to their rapist s baby.Faught s reply is absolutely appalling and demonstrates once again why women should never vote for Republicans, especially Republicans who want to base our laws on the Bible. Well, you know, if you read the Bible, there s actually a couple circumstances where that happened,  Faught said.  The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but it s a reality unfortunately. Faught literally just used the Bible to justify rape. And then he used it to justify incest. Same answer,  Faught replied. Then he argued that Williams  questions have nothing to do with the bill. Williams vehemently disagreed and explained why. You are proffering a divine intervention as the reason why you won t do that and so I think it is very important,  Williams said before demanding Faught repeat his answer again.  This body wants to know   and myself personally   whether you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God. Faught obliged and stated that rape and incest are God s will because God is sovereign over all activities that happen. It s a great question to ask. And, obviously if it happens in someone s life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, but   so you re saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someone s life and can t use anything and everything in someone s life and I disagree with that. Seriously.Here s the video via YouTube.This is exactly the same kind of statement that Republicans like Rick Santorum and Richard Mourdock made during the 2012 Election. I believe and I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created   in the sense of rape   but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you,  Santorum said during his run for the presidency.  As you know, we have to, in lots of different aspects of our life. We have horrible things happen. I can t think of anything more horrible. But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation. I ve struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize that life is that gift from God,  Mourdock said during his Senate run in Indiana. And even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen. Both of these assholes think that rape is sanctioned by God and that women should appreciate the  gift  God is giving them by force. It s disgusting and is the reason why both men lost their races.And now Faught should be ousted from office as well.Featured Image: Wikimedia", WATCH: Oklahoma Republican Declares That Rape Is The ‘Will Of God’

Loughner s bullets killed six people and injured thirteen, including Giffords. The shooter was detained by people at the event and later pleaded guilty to 19 charges related to the shooting   he is currently serving seven consecutive life sentences in prison.However, although he admitted to his crimes and was sentenced accordingly, a lawsuit has allegedly been filed by Loughner against the former congresswoman for $25 million for psychological and emotional distress. It claims claims that he is innocent and was hand-picked  to be an assassin. My incarceration is illegal. I am actually innocent. I was Framed. I am a victim of project mk-ultra the govt. put a chip in my head to control my mind .Gabby Giffords is in the Illuminati and I have evidence of this I was handpicked illegally to be a sleeper assassin. MY HEAD is full of chips and this evil empire govt is controlling me within. The lawsuit claims all sorts of other insane things, as well. It says that he has been waterboarded repeatedly during his incarceration by the ATF, NSA and CIA. The suit also alleges that his attorney is a  global spy  who forced him to plead guilty and that authorities are making him sick from  microwave testing  and  chemtrails.  It even accuses Giffords of funding the San Bernardino shooters.The timing of this lawsuit has made some people think that it is a hoax.

"March 23, 2017","House Republicans had seven years to come up with a plan superior to the Affordable Care Act and their plan is so bad that not even the GOP majority could pass it.After uselessly voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act over sixty times during those years in order to please their conservative base, Republicans appear to be chickening out from actually doing it.Because once the dubiously named American Healthcare Act passes, it would strip health care from over 20 million Americans, many of whom are Republican voters for some reason.The bill would also cause the price of healthcare to skyrocket, especially for senior citizens who would have to pay ten times as much as they do right now under the Affordable Care Act.Anyway, the vote on the Republican bill was scheduled for Thursday, but once Republican leadership realized that they could muster enough members of their own party to get the necessary number of votes, they canceled the vote.Seriously. Republicans control the House and they couldn t even bring up their own bill for an up or down vote. Simply put, it was a humiliating failure of epic proportions.Once Donald Trump found the egg on his face, he immediately demanded that House Republicans vote on Friday. And so we now wait for the moment when Trump suffers a major policy defeat because Republicans discovered that repealing the Affordable Care Act isn t such a great idea after all.Adding to the humiliation on Thursday was CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who pointed out how long Republicans have been having their collective wet-dream about repealing the signature achievement of America s first black president, and then mocked them for failing to do so. It turns out it s a lot easier for Republican leaders to say  repeal and replace  than to do it,  Tapper said. Seven years ago today, the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare was signed into law by President Obama and since that time Republicans have been planning, hoping, dreaming for this day, the moment where they could finally repeal Obamacare and replace it with their own solution to the nation s health care mess. They have had seven years to prepare for this day.Now weeks after optimistic talk from House leaders, declarations from White House secretary Sean Spicer that  the bill will pass the House tonight and there is no Plan B,  well, the bill was in such peril Republican leaders pulled it and postponed the vote. And what critics are calling an  embarrassing and ignominious move,  so humiliating, it signifies the only thing worse would have been to actually bring it to a vote where Republican leaders were apparently confident it would die. Here s the video via YouTube:If this bill fails to pass it will be a humiliating defeat for Trump and Republicans, but it will be a glorious victory for the American people and the millions who rely on the Affordable Care Act to help get and keep accessible and affordable health insurance.So as Friday approaches, Americans need to urge their Republican representatives to vote against the bill. Because if Trump is able to bully the holdouts into voting for it, he can bully them into voting for anything and then America is truly screwed.Featured image via Cagle", WATCH: Jake Tapper Mocks Republicans HARD On CNN For Humiliating Failure To Pass Trumpcare
"March 24, 2016","Poor, poor Ted Cruz. He just can t catch a break.Having endured repeated attacks on his wife by Republican front-runner Donald Trump, Cruz practiced his best  tough guy  face in the mirror, found the nearest camera and told Trump:  Donald, you re a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone.  And it almost would have worked if it weren t for a meddling NBC reporter who pointed out the massive elephant in the room.Without missing a beat, NBC s Hallie Jackson stepped up to ask the one question Cruz didn t want to hear: Are you more loyal to the Republican Party  or your wife? His flailing response speaks volumes.A clearly unimpressed Jackson asks Cruz to explicitly say whether or not he would support Donald Trump as president if he got the nomination. Cruz was left temporarily speechless, before weakly saying the question was irrelevant because Trump was going to lose. Jackson didn t let up:Jackson: That s not answering the question, Senator.Cruz: I am answering the question. Donald Trump will not be the nominee.Jackson: He s leading right now and you just looked into that camera and said he was a coward. Will you support him as the nominee?Cruz: Donald Trump will not be the nomineeWhat makes Jackson s questions so brutal is that for Cruz, he s always struggled to distance himself from Trump while at the same time copying many of his ideas. And like many Republicans, Cruz has repeatedly said he would support the eventual nominee whoever it was, even as he publicly attacked Trump. Just earlier this month, Cruz was still adamant that party loyalty meant everything. My answer is the same. I committed at the outset. I will support the Republican nominee, whoever it is,  Cruz said.Making things even more awkward, Cruz and Trump spent the early part of the election praising each other. Cruz would live to regret tweets like this one.In the end, with Trump s sizable lead in the primaries, Cruz will need to decide what he will do if Trump wins. As he calls Trump a  sniveling coward  on camera, he may soon be faced with having to grovel at Trump s feet (just as his former fellow candidates Chris Christie and Ben Carson have already done). No doubt when that happens, Cruz is going to wish he never met Hallie Jackson.Featured image via Twitter", Cruz’s Attempt To Act Tough Hilariously Backfires When Reporter Asks Him Brutal Follow-Up (VIDEO)
"March 24, 2017","President Obama has finally been vindicated after seven years of Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act resulted in humiliating failure on Friday.Once again, Republicans were forced to cancel a floor vote for their Trumpcare bill the day after previously pulling it because many Republicans couldn t bring themselves to vote for such a terrible piece of legislation.The bill would have repealed the Affordable Care Act, stripping healthcare from over 20 million Americans and causing healthcare premiums to skyrocket.Donald Trump, of course, immediately blamed Democrats for the defeat even though Republicans control the House, Senate, and the White House.In short, Republicans only have themselves to blame because they are the ones who tried to replace the Affordable Care Act with a plan that was just awful and universally opposed across the country.Adding insult to injury, Fox News anchor Bret Baier forcefully pointed out that while Republicans went down in flames, President Obama won the day. Let me just say one thing, the biggest winner today: President Barack Obama, who came out this week and defended his legacy healthcare law,  Baier began.  It is now clear that Republicans cannot do, at least yet, what they planned on doing in the campaign, after campaign from 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016,  repeal and replace  was the mantra. Indeed, Republicans rehearsed their repeal of the Affordable Care Act incessantly, holding over 60 useless symbolic votes over the years. But when push came to shove, Republicans demonstrated that they are incapable of governing even when they control every branch of government. Barack Obama has the win right now, and it has changed the entire way that we look at healthcare,  Baier continued.  It is now the Democrats  version, the ideology, that government does have a role in providing healthcare in some way shape or form. Thousands of Americans across the country showed up at town halls to confront Republicans in defense of the Affordable Care Act and only 17 percent of Americans approved of their bill.And in the end, not enough Republicans were willing to commit political suicide by supporting the bill and decided to stand against it instead.In conclusion, Baier echoed Fox Business host Stuart Varney by noting that Republicans control Congress and the White House but still could not get anything done. The repeal, drag it up by the root has not worked,  Baier said.  They can t get it through a Republican House, a Republican Senate and a Republican president. Today is a win for President Barack Obama. Here s the video via YouTube.Americans should remain vigilant, however, and continue to watch Republicans closely to make sure they don t try to sneak the bill through. Just like the Affordable Care Act failed a few times before it passed, the GOP could always bring up their terrible bill again for another vote.

"March 25, 2016","The Republican Party is panicking over Donald Trump s presidential campaign in a way most Americans have never seen, and certainly haven t seen in over fifty years. Political party conventions have evolved until recently into carefully stage-managed infomercials for the parties and their ideals, but now there is a very real shadow operation under way between Trump and the other campaigns to control the outcome of the actual delegate votes, in order to force or avoid a contested convention.In case you might, as many liberals have, assume that a lot of this is theater being put together by the party   it isn t. The data Republican Party leaders are looking at has them reaching for their heartburn medication, because it forecasts an epic wipeout for the party of Lincoln.Statistical guru Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight put together what a presidential electoral map between frontrunners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton would look like   and the GOP loses even worse than they did in the 2012 and 2008 elections. In the electoral college it would be 374 Democrats, 164 Republicans:Here's what the map might look like in an election held today. Trump's Rust Belt strength would help him keep MO, IN pic.twitter.com/OYueYvWFpG  Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) March 24, 2016Silver bases his data on recent polling of a head to head matchup between Trump and Clinton. Those numbers are also the thing of Republican nightmares.The two most recent nationwide electoral polls (Fox News, Bloomberg) show Clinton winning the race by 11% and 18%. The most recent poll before that, Quinnipiac, has her margin of victory at a still respectable 6%.If the margin of victory is between 10-11%, Silver s model shows states like Georgia and North Carolina flipping to Democrats and eating into the Republican hold on the South. It also shows Democrats winning Arizona (current polling there shows Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick tied with Sen. John McCain). It confines Republicans to the plains and most, but not all, of the Bible Belt states.Derailing Trump s nomination won t be easy to do, but for the GOP party establishment its preferable than what the numbers are currently forecasting: total disaster.Featured image via Flickr", This Map Explains GOP Panic: Dems Headed For EPIC Landslide Win (TWEET)
"March 25, 2017","When Republicans celebrated Donald Trump s undeserved election victory, they probably never imagined he d damage the party as badly as he already has in just nine weeks.This week, Trump once again embarrassed the GOP by messing up their first attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare. Not only did Trump fail to sell the disastrous American Health Care Act, but he pulled the bill on Friday. Understandably, Republicans are pissed that Trump conducted things this way, and are distancing themselves from him more than ever. In fact, they re blaming him and saying that he and the White House had been an obstacle from the start, setting them up for failure. One House Republican (who wanted to remain anonymous) said: Their heart was not in the healthcare battle. Think about the level of intensity on the executive orders for the travel ban, or on the wiretapping claims. He certainly checked the boxes on healthcare, to his credit. But it s self-evident there was not a certain level of intensity devoted to this. Trump and his minions have countered this claim, with Press Secretary Sean Spicer issuing a statement on Saturday: The president and vice president left everything on the field  They were making calls and having members to the White House all week. In total, we spoke or met with over 120 members of Congress. And yet, this doesn t seem to add up, considering that Trump s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were nowhere to be found as sh*t was hitting the fan on Friday. Kushner, who is one of Trump s key advisors, was actually skiing with Ivanka in Aspen as House Republicans tried to pass their horrible health care bill and failed. And it s not just Kushner they re pissed at   it s Trump himself.According to House staffers and other GOPers, Trump didn t seem focused when in meetings concerning the Obamacare repeal. Another unnamed Republican said: Halfway through that meeting, he stopped to talk about Gorsuch. His mind was bouncing around. I never felt they were dialed into this. Maybe next time the GOP will think twice about letting a five-year-old become their party s nominee. What we re witnessing here is the breakdown of the Republican Party, and it s so humiliating that we almost feel bad for them.

"March 26, 2016","Republicans are repulsive people. This is a known fact. But the latest attempt in Indiana to legislate how we mourn takes it to a whole new level:The law says that  a miscarried or aborted fetus must be interred or cremated by a facility having possession of the remains,  and requires  a person or facility having possession of a miscarried or aborted fetus to ensure that the miscarried fetus or aborted fetus is preserved until final disposition occurs. It doesn t matter how far along the pregnancy is. Normally when a pregnancy ends earlier than 20 weeks, the  products of conception  (fetal tissue and the placenta) are treated like any other medical waste. After 20 weeks, the fetus is considered a  stillbirth  and the parents typically have the option to cremate or bury it if they choose.So even if a woman has a miscarriage at 8 weeks of pregnancy at home, under this law she could be required to keep the blood and tissue, take it to a hospital, and have it buried or cremated by a funeral home.Several other states have also passed similar laws (care to guess what color they are on the electoral map?).But why do this?For the last several years, I ve asked pro- life  proponents who insist that fertilized eggs and zygotes and fetuses are fully realized people a very basic question: If this is the case, why is it that no culture on the planet hold funerals for miscarriages or abortions?No one has been able to offer a coherent answer and for good reason: No one has a funeral for a miscarriage because miscarriages are not people.So Republicans are trying to redefine how we view miscarriages. They want us to consider them the moral and legal equivalent of the death of a child. Even if the  child  in this case is an 8-week-old microscopic collection of cells.Let that sink in for a moment: Republicans, the party of  small government,  are literally telling you how to grieve. I can t imagine a more intrusive abuse of government short of prima nocta.Sort of. 2006 was a rough year and my wife and I suffered two miscarriages. We buried the sonograms of two lost pregnancies, planted a tree and set up a plaque:You d think that I would be proof that miscarriages are people worthy of mourning. But you d be very wrong. We were not mourning a lost child, we were mourning the lost possibilities. I have three children now and I can tell you without reservation that I would rather face 1000 miscarriages than lose one of them. There simply is no comparison.Anyone that claims they would be just as hurt by the loss of a fetus as they would a child they held in their arms is, at best, a liar and at worst, a monster that thinks very little of their children.That Republicans would try to further traumatize women by legislating their grief is a reflection of how cruel and debased the party has become.Featured image via simplyoloni.com", Republicans Are Trying To Legislate How We Grieve
"March 26, 2017","Embattled House Intel Chairman, Devin Nunes (R-CA), has been reported to the FBI for corruption. The criminal complaint, filed by Scott Dworkin of the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, seems to include Nunes  failure to disclose the fact that he s got all his money sunk into a winery with heavy ties to Russia (which means he s got a conflict of interest). It may also includ his admission that he had an obligation to inform Trump that some of his transition team s communications got swept up in a foreign surveillance operation.Nunes is definitely compromised, which is worth investigating.Dworkin can t make the details of his complaint public, but he did say that Nunes is unethical and that he was working on just such a complaint earlier today:RT if u think Devin Nunes is unethicalI doI m finishing our House Ethics Complaint on him now#NunesMustResign #trumprussia #russiagate  Scott Dworkin (@funder) March 26, 2017Then he tweeted the news that his criminal complaint had officially been filed, along with the FBI s explanation of their public corruption program.

"March 27, 2016","Experts are saying that Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is being deceptive when he responded to allegations that he had extramarital affairs with five women, allegations originally published by the gossip magazine National Enquirer. One of the women apparently is Donald Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, and the other is Carly Fiorina deputy campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores. So Ted seems to have been quite busy, although the idea is quite gross to think about.Phil Houston developed a model to detect deception when he was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency. He has conducted thousands of interrogations for the CIA and other federal agencies. Houston said: Behaviorally, when the facts are the ally of an individual, he or she almost always tends to focus on the facts of the matter at hand. In this case, if the key fact was that he had not had these affairs, Cruz would almost certainly have been much more strongly focused on the denial. That is, he very likely would have made a point of explicitly stating something along the lines of,  I did not have these affairs.  Yet at no point in either statement did Cruz say that. He implied it by saying the allegations are false, and that they re lies, but behaviorally, such statements are not equivalent to saying he never had the affairs. Even if we were to overlook that fact and consider his statements to be a denial, there is an overwhelmingly higher proportion of attack behavior compared to the effort expended at denial. This type of lopsided attack-to-denial ratio is very consistent with what we have historically seen with deceptive people when allegations are levied against them. Houston was referencing Cruz s two statements denying the allegations, the first of which he posted on his Facebook page: I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won t go. These smears are completely false, they re offensive to Heidi and me, they re offensive to our daughters, and they re offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack. Donald Trump s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow. He subsequently spoke about the scandal (you can watch the video below). Cruz said: The National Enquirer published a story. It is a story that quoted one source on the record: Roger Stone, Donald Trump s chief political advisor. Let me be clear, this National Enquirer story is garbage. It is complete and utter lies. It is a tabloid smear, and it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen. It is attacking my family, and what is striking is Donald s henchman, Roger Stone, had for months been foreshadowing that this attack was coming. It s not surprising that Donald Trump s tweet occurs the day before the attack comes out. And I would note that Mr. Stone is a man who has 50 years of dirty tricks behind him. He s a man for whom a term was coined for copulating with a rodent. Well let me be clear: Donald Trump may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him. And this garbage does not belong in politics. The National Enquirer has endorsed Donald Trump, has said he must be President. And so Donald, when he s losing, when he s scared, when Republicans are uniting against him, decides to peddle sleaze and slime. You know, Donald is fond of giving people nicknames. With this pattern, he should not be surprised to see people calling him,  Sleazy Donald. Based on these two statements, Houston concluded:   Given the lack of additional information upon which to conduct a more comprehensive behavioral analysis, this is nothing more than our initial opinion and assessment, and we will continue to follow this matter very closely. At the same time, we cannot help but conclude at this point that it s not looking good for Sen. Cruz. There are other factors as well: Cruz is a known liar. In fact, he has lied repeatedly during his run for the Republican nomination and has a reputation as a liar throughout his political career. At one point, it was his campaign that sent out mailers that confused voters into believing they had committed some type of violation because they hadn t voted in the previous election in order to scare them into voting for him.  It was also his campaign that purposely duped voters into believing that Ben Carson had dropped out of the race during the Iowa caucuses in order to steal Carson s  votes.In his defense, it can be argued that it s hard to believe that five women, yes five not one, would want to sleep with the likes of Ted Cruz, whose policies are not only draconian, but who isn t exactly a looker either.However, If this expert is correct, then Cruz, who touts himself as a conservative family values man, will go down as one of the biggest GOP hypocrites in history and that s saying a lot because there have been quite a few GOP hypocrites.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YSCzik5uPM]Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr"," Ted Cruz Says He’s Innocent of Sex Scandal, Lie Detecting Experts Say He’s Lying (VIDEO)"
"March 27, 2017","When Donald Trump fails, his team sure doesn t help make it any better.On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer decided to pour salt in the gaping wound that was left when Trump and the GOP suffered a massive failure in gaining approval for their disastrous plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. The American Health Care Act, also known as Trumpcare, not only failed to get enough votes, but Trump pulled it from the House floor because it was such an obvious, humiliating defeat.In speaking to reporters during his daily briefing, Spicer likened Trumpcare to a  bad deal    which was a pretty odd thing to say, considering how much Trump has bragged about what a good negotiator and dealmaker he is. To diss something that Trump supported full-heartedly is definitely not going to make Trump happy. Spicer said: The president also recognizes that when there s not a deal to be made, when to walk away. It s not just about making deals. It s knowing when to walk away from deals and knowing [that] when there s a bad deal, that s the only solution. I think the president understood that where we were, that while you can get a deal at the time, that sometimes a bad deal is worse than getting a deal. And I think he smartly recognized that what was on the table was not going to be keeping with the vision that he had, and so he decided that this was not the time and that a deal was not at hand. Really, who needs critics when you have Spicer? It should also be noted that even after the bill failed, Trump was still praising the GOP s awful plan, stating that it just needed some improvement. Yet Spicer pretty much trashed Trumpcare, and said that the GOP s plan to do away with Obamacare (which they ve been bragging about for the last seven years) was a devastating fail. Looks like Trump really doesn t have a talent for making deals after all.Featured image via Ninian Reid / Flickr", Sean Spicer Just Said Something About Trumpcare That Will Make Trump PISSED (DETAILS)
"March 28, 2016","On Monday, Sarah Silverman released a hilarious video that encourages non-voters to get off the couch and participate in this election no matter which candidate they re voting for   but especially if they re supporting Bernie Sanders.The video has gone viral, shared tens of thousands of times over a few hours. For five hilarious minutes, Silverman cracks jokes in her signature style while making a truly convincing case for the Vermont senator. The comedian and actress stressed how much every vote in this particular election counted when she joked: If you vote or not, that s not my business, I m not your mommy. Though like your mommy, I have a completely full bush It s important that you treat your vote as something valuable, because it is. It s so valuable. Candidates literally spend billions of dollars trying to get your vote. Confessing that she was a fan of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton before Sanders began his presidential campaign, Silverman said: I m a feminist. Democratic woman president? Yes please! Silverman gives an amazing explanation of how nearly every politician s campaign works when she talks about the contributions from corporations and banks that Clinton has been known for. Silverman said that although she was aware that Clinton was taking those contribution, she thought it was just what candidates must do to win in the era of Citizens United. Every politician takes money from big money, ever since it was made legal through Citizens United. It s legalized corruption. If all the other ball players are taking steroids, you have to take steroids too to compete, right? Of course, this was all until Sanders, who Silverman describes as a  giant fuck you to the above-the-law billionaire class , came onto the scene. Once Bernie entered the race, Silverman said that she became a diehard supporter because he was the only candidate to refuse big money and run a different campaign. Silverman clarified, I m not against Hillary. I ve just met someone I have more in common with. Instead, Sanders ran a truly unconventional campaign that was built on the donations of millions of everyday Americans. Silverman explained: This man is running for president on a platform that is just a giant fuck-you to the above-the-law billionaire class who have been controlling government policy with their money, and not paying a nickel in taxes through government loopholes they secure with said money. Without taking a penny from Super PACs, corporations, or self-interest groups, Bernie Sanders raised over $100 million from over 5 million individual donations, donations from human people, averaging $27 each. He proved that what is right can also be possible. Silverman said that Sanders  refusal to follow suit and take big money donations like every other candidate has proven that Citizens United is not a necessary evil. It s just evil.  Also tackling the  socialist  title that has plagued Sanders  campaign, Silverman said: He s a Democrat. He just believes that people who don t have the same advantages as you and me should be given the same advantages as you and me. Silverman assured Americans that they can still fulfill their dreams of becoming rich assholes, it s just that your fellow hard-working citizens don t have to feed their children cat food in order for you to do it. In closing, Silverman begged non-voters to contribute to the election and go against the status quo by casting their vote. She said: Don t be sucked into a rigged American Dream ponzi scheme that was never intended to include you. Vote.

"March 28, 2017","Two anti-abortion activists are facing 15 felony charges after they secretly filmed themselves trying to buy aborted fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood. (In case you missed it, these attempts were unsuccessful because, duh. But that didn t stop them from editing this video footage and then using it to claim that the women s health provider was selling baby parts. They weren t.)State Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced the charges against David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt on Tuesday. The Associated Press reports:The allegations say the pair filmed 14 people without permission between October 2013 and July 2015 in Los Angeles, San Francisco and El Dorado counties. One felony count was filed for each person. The 15th was for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.According to Becerra, Daleiden and Merritt created a fictitious biomedical research company, which they then lied about in order to convince representatives of Planned Parenthood to meet with them   and then they secretly recorded them without their knowledge.Daleiden claims these charges are  bogus  and are only being brought against him because of Planned Parenthood s political cronies.  Naturally. The public knows the real criminals are Planned Parenthood and their business partners,  Daleiden said. (For the record, the women s health care provider has committed zero crimes.)Last April, Daleiden claimed on social media that his home had been raided by agents from the California Department of Justice who confiscated all his video footage, among other things. There had been no word on the investigation since then until the charges were filed with the San Francisco Superior Court on Tuesday.In January of 2016, Daleiden and Merritt were both indicted on similar charges by a grand jury in Texas. That grand jury had originally been convened to investigate Planned Parenthood, but not only did they find no wrongdoing on the part of the women s health care provider, they also ended up indicting the filmmakers for their bogus video. Unfortunately, these charges were dropped because the prosecutor said the jury had overstepped since this was not why they were convened.Featured image via Eric Kayne/Getty Images", Makers Of Fake Planned Parenthood Baby Parts Video Slapped With 15 Felony Charges

Kyle Cardenas of Gilbert, Arizona is a veteran with PTSD who went through two harrowing tours of duty in Iraq. His family says that they contacted the VA Crisis Hotline due to Kyle s having a mental health emergency related to his PTSD. That s when things went wrong.The Gilbert cops showed up, and there was a scuffle. The thing that is really awful here is that the family insisted that they wanted a crisis team   and they also said hammered the point home that they wanted no cops. However, cops   violent cops   are just what they got. They have filed an official complaint, which says, in part: The police charged into this bedroom   and attempted to restrain Kyle again. During the melee, the officers Tased Kyle at least seven times, sprayed OC spray directly into Kyle s face, struck Kyle multiple times with their batons, punched Kyle in the face with closed fists, kicked and kneed Kyle in the thighs and legs, and ordered one of the K-9 unit dogs to attack and bite Kyle. That is beyond despicable, but wait   there s more. When Kyle was immobilized on a hospital gurney, the trigger happy cops used a Taser on him again, this time until his heart stopped beating and medical professionals had to restart it.Of course, despite all of this, the cops are playing the victims here, and they say that they attempted to bring Kyle in without incident, but that he was violent. Well, no sh*t. You were scaring a man who was already suffering from a mental breakdown. This is why police are the last people who should be sent to deal with mental health crises.Thanks to the reckless, violent cops, Kyle Cardenas is now permanently disabled.

"March 29, 2017","The Congressional Black Caucus just broke it down for House Speaker Paul Ryan, explaining to him in no uncertain terms that Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) obviously can t be trusted and needs to be removed as chairman of the Intelligence Committee. This action is necessary in order to meet the public s expectation that Congress conducts an impartial investigation into a matter that threatens the core of our democracy,  the CBC wrote in a statement issued Wednesday. Congressman Nunes  recent actions have caused him to lose the confidence of members of his committee, and, more importantly, the American people, and he can no longer be trusted with the information that the committee receives. Some lawmakers are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Others, like the CBC, are calling on Ryan to remove him as intel chair altogether. The caucus is also demanding that a special  bipartisan commission  be formed to handle the probe into Russia s election meddling and Trump s possible collusion. Congress must create an independent, bipartisan commission to expose the full truth about any and all Trump-Russia connections and collusion,  the statement reads.  The American people want and deserve to know if their government has been compromised by the Kremlin. The Black Caucus is not alone. Democrats have been calling on Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation into Russia s interference in the presidential election. He landed himself in hot water last week when he decided it would be a great idea to announce that intelligence on Donald Trump had been gathered accidentally while monitoring other people of interest, such as the Russian ambassador, without bothering to mention it to the committee first.All hell broke loose when Nunes then decided he should brief Trump on the matter. To make matters worse, it later came out that he secretly visited the White House the night before the announcement was made, leading some to question where his information came from in the first place.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images", Black Caucus Just Broke It Down For Paul Ryan: Time To Get Rid Of Nunes As Intel Committee Chair

The feisty host of CNN s The Lead infamously took Trump s top liar spin doctor, White House Counsel Kellyanne Conway, through a wood chipper for lying to him on air, and even banned her from his show briefly. He also rails Trump daily. Friday s subject? How much Trump is costing taxpayers with his weekly trips to his swanky Florida resort, Mar-A-Lago.Tapper first played the line in one of Trump s speech where he insisted that he and his staff would  do a lot more with less  for the American people. Tapper says after the clip: Do a lot more with less. Presidents are certainly entitled to take a day off, but any deficit hawk would ask: is a weekly visit to Palm Beach doing a lot more with less? It takes Marine One, Air Force One, and motorcades to get the president to his posh oceanside estate, along with intense Secret Service protection. There happens to be another presidential retreat, much closer and cheaper   that of course would be Camp David. It s already set up to be a working White House, and has security protocols in place. Some presidents used the Maryland site more than others, but Camp David is costing taxpayers millions to maintain, while it sits dormant. Then, Tapper hands it over to another CNN reporter, and informs us that Trump s weekly trips have already cost us more than $10 million in just the five weeks he s been in office.This is outrageous. Isn t there a way the Secret Service or someone can inform Trump that this isn t his money, or his private plane, that others are paying for this   most of them being people who absolutely despise him?

"March 30, 2016","The explosion of a nuclear missile in the heart of heavily populated Europe would be an unprecedented act that would kill hundreds of thousands   perhaps millions   of people. Donald Trump told MSNBC s Chris Matthews that he would refuse the suggestion that he take such a horrible idea off the table.The exchange occurred during a televised  town hall  interview between the current Republican frontrunner and the MSNBC host.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCj0B7HhEFsWhen host Chris Matthews asked if the real estate mogul could definitively say he wouldn t use nuclear weapons, he responded:  I would never say that. I would never take any of my cards off the table. Matthews pressed him, asking if he would consider using nuclear weapons in Europe. No, I don t think so,  Trump said, but he again said he wouldn t definitively write off the option.In a New York Times interview published over the weekend, Trump stressed the importance of unpredictability in his foreign policy. He told Matthews Wednesday that  you d be a bad negotiator  for taking any strategy off the table.Trump s comments ironically echo the sentiments of 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, who is considered the first person in the mold of a modern conservative to be a major party nominee in America.In an interview, Goldwater said he would consider the use of low-yield atomic bombs in North Vietnam, in order to defoliate forests, and to destroy bridges and railroad lines leading to China. The policy was so extreme and out there, that it became the basis of what is one of the most famous political ads ever,  Daisy,  released by Lyndon Johnson s campaign. The ad contrasted Goldwater s casual support of atomic war versus the policies of the Johnson administration.The ad only aired once. Johnson went on to one of the largest electoral victories in U.S. history. He won 61% of the popular vote and 486 electoral votes to Johnson s 52 (his home state of Arizona and the 5 states in the pro-segregation south).Featured image via Wikimedia Commons/Flickr", This Would Cause The Death Of Millions But Trump Says He Might Do It As President (VIDEO)
"March 30, 2017","Michael Flynn drove another nail into the coffin of Donald Trump s presidency on Thursday when he agreed to testify about Russia in exchange for immunity. This prompted one member of the House Intelligence Committee to state the obvious:  Innocent people don t ask for immunity. Speaking to MSNBC s Chris Hayes, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said what we have all been thinking since the announcement was made that Flynn was willing to testify in exchange for immunity. If you didn t do anything wrong, then you don t need immunity. The only reason to seek immunity is to protect yourself from prosecution from the illegal crap you ve done. Innocent people don t ask for immunity, but that s not something that I m familiar with in our investigation. If he has something to say and he s not worried about what he did, he should just come forward and testify in a public setting,  Swalwell added.Hayes argued that there might be some scenarios where an innocent person would ask for immunity. The MSNBC host said that asking for immunity doesn t automatically mean you are guilty of something. What if they are worried about perjury? Or concerned that maybe their words could somehow be used against them in some other way? Hey, it s possible, right?Swalwell wasn t having it. He said that prosecutors don t run around seeking perjury charges because somebody had a lapse of memory. But this isn t the case when it comes to Flynn, he explained.

"March 31, 2016","When Republican Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed HB 1337 into law last week, he wasn t expecting women to personally keep him informed about their bodily functions. But that is exactly what is happening since Pence and Republicans made a new law banning abortion based on race or gender, requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals, and forces doctors  to provide information about perinatal hospice care to a pregnant woman who is considering an abortion because the unborn child has been diagnosed with a lethal fetal anomaly. In other words, women considering an abortion will be lectured by their doctor after being informed about any lethal fetal anomaly. Once a woman is informed of such an anomaly, she will no longer be able to get an abortion because the new law prohibits abortions in such cases. That means women are going to be forced to carry fetuses with anomalies to term, regardless of viability, which means women could end up giving birth to babies that will suffer and die soon after being born.In response to this latest attack on a woman s right to choose, women are actually calling in to inform Governor Pence of their reproductive cycle status and the phone conversations are comedy gold. I need to get a message to the Governor that I am on day three of my period. My flow seems abnormally heavy, but my cramps are much better to  she tells the person who answered before being interrupted. Ma am, what is it that I can help you with?  the person asks. Oh, I don t need your help, I just wanted to keep Governor Pence informed of my reproductive cycle, since he seems so concerned,  the woman replied.The phone calls are the result of a call-to-action campaign led by a group known as  Periods for Pence,  which seeks to give women a voice in the state since Pence and Republicans didn t really consider what women think before imposing their anti-abortion agenda on all women in Indiana. The more I read this bill, the more vague language I found and the more loopholes, and it just seemed incredibly intrusive,  the creator of the campaign told WRTV.  So I wanted to give a voice for women who really didn t feel like they were given any kind of input into a bill that would affect our life so much. The campaign s Facebook page even generously provided the number to reach the Governor s Office, which is 317-232-4567, for those of you who want to know, and women started calling the number to keep Pence updated on what s going on with their uterus since Pence and the GOP want to know so desperately. And it led to the call above and this one: Good Morning,  a woman said upon reaching the Governor s office.  I just wanted to inform the Governor that things seem to be drying up today. No babies seem to be up in there. Okay? Upon being asked her name, the woman replied that her name is Sue Magina.  That s M-A-G-I-N-A. It rhymes with  she said before being cut off.Here s the video:Yeah, this campaign is perfect and I m sure Governor Pence is super-stoked about receiving constant updates on what s going on with women s reproductive cycles. So women should definitely call him and make sure to provide as many details as possible. After all, he clearly wants to know since he can t stop invading women s privacy to regulate their reproductive health decisions.

"March 31, 2017","Donald Trump is unwell.The beleaguered president seemed vaguely irritated and distracted in what was meant to be a routine executive order signing. After remarks by Mike Pence, Trump said just a few words before hastily leaving the room. The one thing he forgot to do was the whole reason he was there in the first place: sign the executive order.Realizing Trump s mistake, Pence scrambles to stop Trump and get him to sign the document. Instead, Trump orders him to get the folder from his desk and bring it to him to sign outside of the room. Pence, realizing he s about to go viral as a bit player in Trump s latest on-camera screw up, awkwardly saunters over to the desk, grabs the folder and rushes out of the room.Trump walked out of an executive order signing ceremony without having signed the executive orders pic.twitter.com/v0SjanotTe  POLITICO (@politico) March 31, 2017Trump appeared reluctant to come back into the room and it s pretty obvious why. As he mistakenly left, a reporter began asking him questions about his baffling remarks about Michael Flynn on Twitter this morning.Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017It s understandable that he didn t want to explain the tweet, it could lead to Trump s eventual downfall. As the New York Times points out, should the DOJ give Michael Flynn immunity, it would mean they likely have bigger fish to fry.Immunity should be granted as soon as Congress and prosecutors are persuaded that Mr. Flynn has information that will lead to a criminal case against one or more people at least as important to the alleged wrongdoing as Mr. Flynn may be. The overriding objective must be learning who if anyone in the United States collaborated with the Russians as well as who knew about it, what they knew and when they knew it.Who might that big fish be? Well there was only one person working directly above Michael Flynn: Donald Trump.Featured image via Twitter", Trump Has Brain Fart In Middle Of Executive Order Signing Leaving Pence To Frantically Cover (VIDEO)
"March 4, 2016","A few days after the Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado Springs that left three dead and twelve injured, the National Rifle Association (NRA) released the dumbest pro-gun commercial likely ever seen. In the months since the commercial was released and in the aftermath of more mass shootings, it has popped up on my television screen multiple times. Every single time I see it my brain melts a little at the sheer absurdity of it.It is titled, Demons At Our Door,  (ooohhh scary) and begins with a close-up of a somber NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre. He starts out saying, You and I didn t choose to be targets in the age of terror  As he is speaking ominous music is playing in the background with black and white photos of ordinary American scenes flash across the screen. He continues: But innocents like us will continue to be slaughtered no amount of bloodshed will every satisfy the demons among us They will come to where we worship, where we educate and where we live. He s so right! They have!Dylann Roof walked into a church and murdered nine people with a firearm while they prayed. Adam Lanza marched into Sandy Hook Elementary School and gunned down twenty first-graders and six educators. Shawn Fuller filled his three- and four-year-old sons bodies with bullets in North Carolina last summer.Gun crazy ammosexuals are murdering our children, mothers, fathers, friends, etc. constantly and  no amount of bloodshed  has satisfied these people. Never fear, though, Wayne has a solution for us: But when evil knocks on our doors, Americans have a power that no other people on the planet share Tell me more, Savior LaPierre! The full-throated right to defend our families and ourselves with our Second Amendment. Wait WTF?  MOAR GUNZ!  Really? How is that going to solve the problem?Obviously, I realize that he is fearmongering about scary Mooslims murdering innocent Americans, but it sure didn t sound like it. He perfectly described the right-wing gun lunatics who have waged a campaign of terror on us for decades. Nobody is safe from LaPierre s brethren and no place has been sacred to them.The people we need to fear in this country are not Muslims, they are the people he is actively encouraging to arm themselves. He and his organization are the reason so many of us are dying. His hypocrisy is mind-blowing.Watch it below:Featured image via video screenshot", This NRA Commercial Is So Stupid It Will Melt Your Brain (VIDEO)

We can no longer afford to ignore a very important fact: The man currently occupying the Oval Office is dangerously unhinged. His behavior becomes more outrageous and erratic every day. He lies pathologically, peddles conspiracy theories, threatens the free press, decries any story he doesn t like as  fake news,  and holds his officials hostage and forces them to lie repeatedly to the American public as well.There have been some brave souls in Congress who have openly questioned the president s mental stability   most notably Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA). However, the Democrats are not in control, so they can do nothing to put safeguards in place to keep Trump s instability from endangering the nation even more than he has already. So, it s time for the GOP to step up and put country before party, and admit that they know that Donald Trump is stark raving mad and has no business being president.Until then, thank you journalists at papers like the New York Daily News for speaking truth to power.

At the same time, the party was severely critical of existing political leaders in Germany for not addressing the needs and will of the people. They promised widespread economic prosperity, a regained national strength via the military, and to make Germany great again. Does this sound familiar?Republicans have spent the better part of eight years now calling President Obama   one of the greatest leaders of the modern era   a fascist, Nazi, communist, dictator and whatever else they can come up with that has a negative governmental connotation.

The amateur president went on a tweetstorm yesterday, likely to deflect from his own scandals, to accuse Barack Obama of having his phones tapped during the campaign. Trump s newest conspiracy theory isn t going down well. Even Director James Comey asked the Justice Department to publicly reject Trump s claims. That Comey. The one who interfered with the election process by sending a letter to Congress suggesting that there was something the FBI had on Hillary Clinton. As it happens, it was all a ruse to help defeat Trump s Democratic opponent. We re sure Comey is rethinking his actions now.Still yet, Trump is doubling down on his fact-free conspiracy theory.The Hill reports:The CEO of Newsmax Media, known for having a relationship with President Trump, wrote on Sunday that Trump insists he will be proven right regarding his allegation of wiretaps at Trump Tower. I spoke with the President twice yesterday about the wiretap story. I haven t seen him this pissed off in a long time,  Christopher Ruddy wrote in an article for Newmax. When I mentioned Obama  denials  about the wiretaps, he shot back:  This will be investigated, it will all come out. I will be proven right,  he said.Again, there is zero proof of Trump s claims and a President cannot authorize a wiretap in this manner. Trump supporters, even CEOs, believe whatever the alleged president says. We re still waiting for Trump s team of investigators to get back from Hawaii to prove that Obama, America s first black president, did not legitimately hold the highest seat in the land. Trump dogged former president Barack Obama for years. He then went on to accuse Hillary Clinton of corruption.

The new plan will keep two important provisions of Obamacare. Protections for pre-existing conditions will remain in place and parents will continue to be able to keep their children on their policies until age 26.Now, the bad.

"March 7, 2016","In big news coming out of the Supreme Court, it was the opinion of the Court that a decision made by an Alabama court refusing to recognize a same-sex adoption will be overturned.When one half of an Alabama couple sought to have the adoption of her children be recognized in her state of Alabama, she was denied, even though the couple together had previously been granted approval by the state of Georgia. The couple has since split up, but both individuals are still parents to their children, as it would be with any heterosexual couple. However, the entire thing does start to get very confusing.Here s the run down via NPR: The two women in the case were together for 16 years, and they had three children conceived by assisted reproductive technology   an older daughter, now 13, and boy and girl twins, now 11. The actual names of the parents have not been revealed. They are identified in court documents by the initials V.L. and E.L.E.L. was the biological mother and V.L. subsequently adopted the children with her partner s explicit consent. The adoption was in Georgia, where both women appeared at a court hearing, and the final adoption decree recognized both as the children s legal parents.When the parents, now living in Alabama, split five years ago, however, the biological mother denied her former partner access to the children. The Alabama courts initially ordered a decree of shared custody, based on the Georgia adoption, but the Alabama Supreme Court overturned the lower court orders. The state Supreme Court said the Georgia courts had wrongly agreed to the adoption.The adoptive mother appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and on Monday the justices unanimously overruled the Alabama Supreme Court in a short, unsigned opinion. Now, all of that aside, let s just get it out there that this was a frickin terrible thing to do, and as a lesbian myself, to see a woman use anti-gay laws against her former partner as a means to try to keep her away from her own children is pretty much the lowest of the low. But I digress Thankfully, the Court sided with the mother who had adoptive rights in Georgia with the argument was brought up where according to the Constitution in Article IV, Section 1, where the Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.  Basically, what s good for the goose, better damn well be good for the gander, and all states need to respect legal acts and proceedings from other states.  According to Cathy Sakimura of the National Center for Lesbian Rights: The Supreme Court s reversal of Alabama s unprecedented decision to void an adoption from another state is a victory not only for our client but for thousands of adopted families. No adoptive parent or child should have to face the uncertainty and loss of being separated years after their adoption just because another state s court disagrees with the law that was applied in their adoption. This decision could affect up to 30 different states, according to a brief that was  submitted by adoption and child welfare agencies. If we re going to have marriage equality, then that equality needs to reach across all levels of the law. This should include, but not be limited to, adoption, and worker s rights as well. No one should be fired for being gay, which currently is still allowed in 28 states. It s 2016, people, gay rights are human rights. There should be no difference whatsoever.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons", Supreme Court Just Delivered HUGE Win For Same-Sex Adoption (VIDEO)

This is especially true of Trump s latest lie, which is the insane accusations he made on Saturday morning about President Obama wiretapping Trump Tower during the 2016 election. Of course, this is the most outrageous statement ever made by a sitting president, but it s Donald Trump, so of course he did it. Well, there are hearings coming up regarding ties between the Trump campaign and Russian hacking, so Rep. Schiff is looking forward to getting to the bottom of all of this.Appearing on Tuesday night s edition of The Rachel Maddow Show, the Ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said that he intends to ask FBI Director James Comey directly about Trump s wild Twitter accusations against the former President. Schiff said of the upcoming March 20 hearings: The president has asked our committee to investigate this and I would say, Mr. President, we accept. We will investigate this. We should be able to determine in fairly short order whether this allegation is true or false. Rep. Schiff went on to say that if (as we all know they will) the allegations turn out to be false, it s just as huge of a scandal, if not more so, as it would be if they were true, since it would be the scandal of a sitting U.S. president alleging that his predecessor engaged in the most unscrupulous and unlawful conduct. Adam Schiff is right. Further, if and when it comes out that Trump flat-out lied, that really should be an impeachable offense. And if that isn t enough, the House Intelligence Committee has an all-star line-up of people who will be testifying, including National Security Agency head Admiral Mike Rogers, former CIA director John Brennan, former National Intelligence Director James Clapper, and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, among others.Pop your popcorn, folks.

"March 8, 2017","Trump and his administration have been dogged by ongoing accusations and reports that they re in bed with Russia. But a huge part of the story got lost in the controversy over the presidential election, and it implicates the entire Republican Party. In addition to the DNC, Russia targeted the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and several Democratic House races with their cyberattack.The hackers are Guccifer 2.0, according to a December report in The New York Times, and they made public the names, cell phone numbers, email addresses and even personal addresses of the Democratic candidates they went after. But they didn t stop there   they also released batches upon batches of internal party documents, seemingly with the intent to influence the closest House races in the country.And how is Paul Ryan involved in any of this? The National Republican Campaign Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a superPAC that s tied to Ryan, both used stolen D.C.C.C. documents to mount an attack campaign against Joe Garcia, a Florida Democrat who lost a very competitive race with Carlos Curbelo who unseated Garcia in 2014.The illicit material was used in other states as well, including swing states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio and North Carolina; as well as in Illinois and New Mexico. Anywhere where Democratic candidates were in very tight races against their GOP opponents.Whether Paul Ryan knew about the CLF s use of material hacked by the Russians is anyone s guess. The point remains, though, that his own super-PAC used information that came courtesy of Russia, which means that Russia didn t just influence the presidential side of things   they influenced the Congressional side of things.And it s not like they had material that they genuinely thought was just flowing from some natural spigot. Several Republicans did refuse the chance to use the hacked documents in part because they knew it came  from a possible foreign source. The D.C.C.C. s chairman, Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, sent a letter to his counterpart at the N.R.C.C. when he first saw an ad that appeared to use the hacked documents: The N.R.C.C. s use of documents stolen by the Russians plays right into the hands of one of the United States  most dangerous adversaries. Put simply, if this action continues, the N.R.C.C. will be complicit in aiding the Russian government in its effort to influence American elections. And that s what s happened. Russia had its hands in far more than our presidential election and calls the results of every federal race in 2016 into serious question.

"March 9, 2016","When a bunch of kids were recently asked what they thought about Republican front-runner Donald Trump, they proved to America just how braindead Trump s conservative supporters were with their answers. Now, 8-year-old Jackson Wheeles from Jamestown, North Carolina is giving us another great example of the sort of intelligence we wish every voting American possessed.Jackson has not only been watching the 2016 presidential election with a close eye, but he has a message for the GOP s most popular candidate   and it s going to sting. Jackson was inspired to write his feelings in a letter addressed to Trump after his teacher at Millis Road Elementary showed her class the news. Jackson s message to the business mogul is a stark reminder that even those who are too young to vote in this election are watching   and judging. Jackson wrote: I have read several articles about you and have seen you on the television. I think you have been very rude to many people. I know that you are talking to adults when you give your speeches, because they are the ones that can vote. It is important for you to remember that children are watching and hearing you, too. Someday, we will also be able to vote. Photo Credit: Kelley WheelessJackson also gave Trump a priceless lesson on manners and the  Golden Rule    do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Honestly, this is a lesson in human decency that someone as old as Trump should have learned by now. I learned about The Golden Rule when I was VERY young. How would you feel if people said some of these terrible things about you that I have heard you say about them? Do you ever feel sorry about the things that you say that are hurtful to others? I have never heard you apologize. Jackson demonstrated just how closely he s been watching Trump when he called out Trump for mocking a handicapped reporter in November. What would happen if young people decided that it was OK to make fun of handicapped people after watching you do that on national TV? Bullying is already a HUGE problem, and it is NOT OK! I feel like you could make that problem much worse. Trump also got slammed by the third grader for stating that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City and still rise in the polls. Jackson spoke for both children and (level-headed) adults when he told Trump that he flat-out terrifies people. You make kids afraid when they hear that someone who could be our next President would even think of doing something like that! Jackson left Trump with this epic piece of wisdom: start thinking of America s youth and how his words and behavior will impact them. We may not be able to vote yet, but we are the future. I think it is important for us to have a kind, honest, caring person as our leader that we can look up to and respect. I am in the student government this year at my school. I try to be a student that everyone can look up to. I will grow up to be a husband, a father, hopefully a police officer, and a good friend. I will choose to be a better person than what you have been teaching me to be.

"March 9, 2017","Republicans nationwide seem to want to get rid of regulations on just about everything   guns, corporations, environmental protections, etc., but when it comes to women, they can t regulate fast enough.There is currently a state bill in Texas that just passed through the Senate committee on State Affairs unanimously (8-0) that will allow doctors to lie to women about anything wrong with their baby. Not only that, it prevents parents from being allowed to sue.According to the Dallas Voice: SB25   which would allow doctors to withhold information from pregnant women about the status of their fetus and then, if the child were born with a deformity or disability, prevent the parents from suing the doctor for withholding the information   has passed out of the Senate Committee on State Affairs on an 8-0 vote and is headed to the full Senate. The man behind SB 25? State Sen. Brandon Creighton (R- Conroe).senate.texas.govCreighton is described  as a genuine defender of conservative values. He has relentlessly hammered excessive taxation, pursued  loser pays  tort reform, passed drug testing for unemployment benefits, stood up for Texas  10th Amendment rights and effectively blocked Obamacare s Medicaid expansion.  So, really, he s an a**hole on pretty much every level. He hates the poor, hates women, and hates people being able to sue companies when something happens to them because of a product or service.When it comes to SB 25, he says: Senate Bill 25 will send a message that Texas does not believe that a life, in and of itself, is an injury in which parents need a damage payment. He thinks doctors should be able to keep pertinent information about a baby in the womb from the parents and that doctor should be protected for doing so. That s messed up on so many levels. It isn t pro-life, it s pro-birth and anti-freedom, and seems pretty damn immoral. It s a bill to prevent abortion by holding back information. The fact that it s already passed the Senate Committee 8-0 is even more mortifying.According to the Dallas Voice: Blake Rocap, legislative director for NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, said,  We shouldn t have to stand up and say that it shouldn t be policy for the state of Texas to excuse doctors from lying to their patients, and that is what this bill does. One would think that should be obvious, but Republicans are getting more outrageous and bold in their hatred of women by the day.

Our gun obsessed nation has gotten to the point where deadly weapons in the hands of children too young for kindergarten actually has a body count.Last year, a Washington Post analysis found that toddlers were finding guns and shooting people at a rate of about one a week. This year, that pace has accelerated. There have been at least 23 toddler-involved shootings since Jan. 1, compared with 18 over the same period last year.In the vast majority of cases, the children accidentally shoot themselves. That s happened 18 times this year, and in nine of those cases the children died of their wounds.Toddlers have shot other people five times this year.The most recent instance of this problem grabbing national headlines was when a two-year-old Milwaukee child got ahold of a gun carelessly placed on the backseat of a car and shot his mother, 26-year-old Patrice Price, killing her.Despite these horrific incidents, unacceptable in so much of the advanced, modern world but treated in America as if there s nothing to be done, the will to do anything about guns at the federal level is almost nonexistent.Intimidated by the NRA flexing its muscles to oppose pro-gun safety political candidates, Republicans and a few Democrats in Congress have refused to bring up legislation about guns. If any action has occurred, it has been in the states, and largely in states with a large Democratic majority in the northeast   which leaves citizens in the rest of the country unprotected thanks to some strategically placed campaign contributions.Recently the NRA s media arm, NRA News, went after Hillary Clinton because she has argued in favor of legislation that the gun lobby opposes. More of that sort of behavior is to be expected in the general election, but they did the same against President Obama in 2008 and 2012, obviously unsuccessfully. Despite their bravado and paid political attackers, their bark at the polls is far louder than their bite. If politicians ignored the noise, gun legislation could actually pass despite the NRA s insistence.Featured image via YouTube", The Amount Of People Shot This Year So Far By TODDLERS Will Make Your Stomach Turn
"May 1, 2017","White House press secretary Sean Spicer literally denied the meaning of alleged president Donald Trump s words during a briefing on Monday. The former reality show star gave a bizarre interview earlier on Monday on CBS  Face the Nation from the Oval Office in which Trump once again, said that former president Barack Obama illegally tapped his phone lines.  I don t stand by anything,  Trump told John Dickerson.  I just, you can take it the way you want. I think our side s been proven very strongly. And everybody s talking about it. The interview ended abruptly with Trump walking away after being pressed by the reporter to back up his claim. So, Spicer was asked about that crazy-time interview then twisted himself into a pretzel in an attempt to defend his boss. The president said,  I don t stand by anything.  How is the American public supposed to digest that, supposed to trust what the president says when he himself says, of his own comments, I don t by anything,  a pool reporter asked Spicer. I think the point is, he clearly stands by that,  Spicer said.  That s something that s made very clear if you look at the entire back and forth exchange. Even though the exchange is documented on video after being televised, Spicer insisted that what we heard is not what we all heard. It was about wiretapping,  the reporter pressed on when asked to be specific. Spicer said it  was a long back and forth  and added that he  clearly stands by that. So, Trump stands by his  I don t stand by anything  remark as well as his conspiracy-theory based wiretap claim. Watch: You don t have to ask me,  Trump responded to one of Dickerson s attempts to clarify his baseless claim.  Because I have my own opinions. You can have your own opinions. The House and Senate Intelligence committees previously announced that there is no evidence to back up Trump s claim. As for Spicer repeatedly asking for clarification, let s help him out. Trump made baseless and unprecedented attacks on his predecessor and his White House press secretary is defending him. Also, according to Trump and his White House press secretary, the alleged president doesn t  stand by anything.  Still yet, Spicer feigned to know nothing about the interview, repeatedly asking for clarification.Why is it when Trump says something, we need it to be translated? Then Spicer muddles it even more.

At the University of California San Diego, however, the naked final exam is a requirement for a class in the visual arts department.Students are required to perform  a gesture that traces, outlines or speaks about your  erotic self(s),  according to the course syllabus. In the performance, all of the students are naked, along with the professor, Ricardo Dominguez, who has taught the class for 11 years. It s the standard canvas for performance art and body art,  Dominguez told local ABC News affiliate KGTV.  It is all very controlled If they are uncomfortable with this gesture, they should not take the class.  He was defending the class after one mother spoke out, claiming the requirement was not clear and was a  perversion. According to the UCSD Visual Arts department website, the course is a prerequisite for a verbal performance art class. Fully 95% of students in the class receive a grade of  A,  according to the college course ratings website koofers.com.Domniguez s biography on the department website lists a series of political efforts, including a government-funded project called the  Transborder Immigrant Tool,  in which he handed out cell phones to prospective illegal immigrants with instructions about how to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.The goal of the project, which was funded by U.S. government grants and UCSD, and which was subsequently investigated by Congress, was to use poetry to  dissolve  the border.Via: Breitbart News",MOTHER OUTRAGED OVER DAUGHTER BEING ASKED TO ARRIVE NUDE TO EXAM BY RADICAL COLLEGE PROF Whose Past Includes Aiding Illegals To Cross Border Into US
"May 10, 2016","Stand your ground laws are reasons for legalized murder, literally, and here South Carolina has given you proof. This is no murky case a la Michael Brown or Trayvon Martin (though, to sane people, those weren t murky, either). But no   one 39-year-old James Edward Loftis of Goose Creek, South Carolina, is using the state s  Stand Your Ground  law to literally get away with cold blooded, pre-meditated murder. It looks like it could work, too.Reports say that Loftis had called a cab to take him home from a strip club, but failed to pay the fare. That s when all hell broke loose. The cab driver, 46-year-old Guma Oz Dubar, along with his friend who was present at the time, 32-year-old Cody Newland, insisted that Loftis make good on the money they owed him for the cab ride. Loftis has provided many different details regarding what transpired next, but his story is the only ones the police have, as Newland and Dubar are dead, by Loftis  hand. The only thing the defendant will confess to is shooting both victims before burning their bodies in graves he dug in his own yard to hide his crimes.Deputy Solicitor Bryan Alfaro said of Loftis s actions: They were essentially just slow-cooked inside the grave site. After that, Loftis s attorney decided to use the state s so-called  stand your ground  law to try to get the defendant off. The law says you can kill people invading your property. However, these people were not invading. They had picked this dude s drunk ass up from a strip club, and he didn t want to pay for the ride home. Doesn t sound like much of an  invasion  to me. This defense, however, got the judge to decide that Loftis is not a flight risk, and, despite his cold-blooded commission of a double murder, Loftis is now out on $250,ooo bail.Loftis s lawyer, Stephen Harris, continues his ludicrous defense, saying: He s a human being. He freaked out and thought he was going to prison, so he tried to hide the bodies. Nobody knows how you re going to react when you kill two people.Well, Mr. Harris, most folks would just pay the cab fare and go in, instead of stiffing the driver and then killing him and his friend. But I suppose that is irrelevant to you and your client, right? Two innocent people are dead over this insanity, and you re going to use South Carolina s insane gun laws to get your client off when he should clearly rot in prison for the rest of his life.I wish there were a Hell so you and Mr. Loftis could burn there.

"May 10, 2017","Days after testifying in front of Congress and after requesting more resources for the Russian investigation, FBI Director James Comey was fired on Tuesday night, effective immediately.The Trump administration is blaming Comey s handling of the Hillary Clinton emails, which makes no sense whatsoever because Trump loved Comey s handling of the emails in October. Trump tried to make the case that he fired Comey for being mean to Hillary Clinton, but even the most rabid Trump supporters have to acknowledge that his  Lock Her Up,  slogan is completely incompatible with Trump s given rationale.It doesn t take a tin foil conspiracy theorist to imagine that the real reason for the Comey firing is that he was getting too close to the truth in investigating Trump s Russia connections. NPR imagines even more scenarios, like the fact that Comey was becoming too big and was stepping on poor little Donnie s ego. It s becoming more and more likely though, that there were just two reasons Comey was fired and both of them should scare the hell out of you.According to two sources that CNN is calling  close to Comey,  the two reasons Comey was fired were:#2 confirms everything we ve been assuming since the news broke Tuesday night. #1, though, while not at all surprising, is almost more frightening. Trump had to have approached Comey at some point, demanding his loyalty. That s third-rate Banana Republic dictator crap. It makes one wonder just how many people have had to make an oath of loyalty, not to the Constitution, but to Trump. Maybe it s just the people who might have damaging goods on the administration or maybe it s every single person in his administration, which could explain why hundreds of jobs still remain unfilled within the Executive Branch.Loyalty oaths or no loyalty oaths, the Trump administration s charade when it comes to the handling is quickly coming unraveled. It likely won t be long before Comey, and not just sources close to him, are speaking out   and perhaps speaking to Congress.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images", Comey Sources Are Speaking Out; He Was Fired For Two Reasons And They Are Both Frightening (VIDEO)

Its appearance before the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva is the second review of the U.S. rights record, following the first in 2010.A string of countries ranging from Malaysia to Mexico pressed the U.S. to redouble efforts to prevent police using excessive force against minorities. Welcome to Mexico. It to likely you ll find any human rights violations here. Oh and here s a prison in Malaysia. Nothing to see here The U.N.Human Rights Council has more pressing issues to deal with like hmmm .maybe their concerned about whether or not the terrorists we re keeping in our Guantanamo Bay Prison have soccer balls that are properly inflated We must rededicate ourselves to ensuring that our civil-rights laws live up to their promise,  Justice Department official James Cadogan told delegates, adding that that is particularly important in the area of police practices and pointing to recent high-profile cases of officers killing unarmed black residents. These events challenge us to do better and to work harder for progress through both dialogue and action,  he said at the session s opening. He added that the government has the authority to prosecute officials who  wilfully use excessive force,  and that criminal charges have been brought against more than 400 law-enforcement officials in the past six years.Several countries, including Brazil and Kenya, voiced concern over the extent of U.S. surveillance in the light of reports about the National Security Agency s activities.David Bitkower, a deputy assistant attorney general, responded that  U.S. intelligence collection programs and activities are subject to stringent and multilayered oversight mechanisms.  He added that the country doesn t collect intelligence to suppress dissent or to give U.S. businesses a competitive advantage, and that there is  extensive and effective oversight to prevent abuse. Faced with widespread calls for a moratorium on executions and a move to scrap the death penalty, Bitkower noted that it is an issue of  extensive debate and controversy  within the U.S. He pointed to  heightened procedural safeguards  for defendants prosecuted for capital offenses.Brig. Gen. Richard Gross, the legal counsel to the chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, told the council that President Barack Obama has said closing Guantanamo   in which he has been thwarted by Congress   is  a national imperative.

"May 11, 2016","Plant workers for some of the largest poultry producers in the United States are being forced to work in truly horrific conditions as their parent companies generate billions in profits. According to a new report from Oxfam America, some of these employees are being denied bathroom breaks and have resorted to wearing diapers while processing the food you eat.Three of the biggest companies are named in the report.The report cited unnamed workers from Tyson Foods Inc., Pilgrim s Pride Corp., Perdue Farms Inc. and Sanderson Farms Inc. who said that supervisors mock them, ignore requests and threaten punishment or firing. When they can go, they wait in long lines even though they are given limited time, sometimes 10 minutes, according to the report. Some workers have urinated or defecated themselves while working because they can t hold on any longer, the report said. Some workers  restrict intake of liquids and fluids to dangerous degrees,  Oxfam said.The poultry companies deny the allegations, but Oxfam says they have heard similar stories before from industry employees, and allege that supervisors ignore established company policy.Oxfam has put together an online campaign with the hashtag #GiveThemABreak to highlight these horrific business practices. They also point out the contradiction in how workers are being treated versus company profits. I was stunned when poultry workers in Arkansas told me that people regularly wear diapers to work in the plants,  says Minor Sinclair, Director of Oxfam America s US Program.  They feel they have to put up with this, to keep their jobs. The supervisors do whatever they can to keep the line running at breakneck speed, and the companies turn a blind eye, as they re racking up record profits. It feels like something out of  The Jungle,  from a hundred years ago, but it s happening right now. It just isn t right.

"May 11, 2017","Prior to the Nov. 8 election, the FBI was, more or less, Trumpland. They wanted Trump to win. They neither trusted nor approved of Hillary Clinton. And that anti-Hillary attitude led to a number of anti-Hillary leaks to the press from the agency. They were angry with James Comey s decision not to indict Hillary over her emails.Now, though, the FBI is wracked with shock, anger and grief over Comey s sudden firing. According to the Daily Beast, one agent said his abrupt dismissal was like a death in the family. Another said that they re basically  sitting shiva,  which is a Jewish ritual of mourning just after a funeral.And some of them are doing something very unusual for a situation like this: They re posting pictures of themselves with Comey on social media, and even changing their profile pics to those of Comey. That s a gesture generally reserved for someone who dies.Acting Director Andrew McCabe told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Comey was well-liked and had broad support throughout the bureau. In other words, when Trump said that Comey had lost the trust and respect of his rank and file, he was either not speaking for the majority of the rank and file, or he was flat-out lying.Rank-and-file agents were also very suspicious of the timing of Comey s firing, wondering whether it had anything to do with the Russia probes. Various officials  phones were ringing off the hook. FBI headquarters in D.C. was more or less locked down and not answering the flood of phone calls coming in.One agent told the Daily Beast that there s likely to be serious distrust of whoever Trump puts into Comey s place: No matter who gets the job, there will be a cloud of suspicion because the President is unpopular with much of the [U.S.]. That bad faith will make it harder to do my job. Trump undermined the public s trust in the FBI more than Comey ever could. The new director is going to face a tough confirmation, with much of the Senate viewing Trump with suspicion, too. That makes possible picks like Rudy Giuliani out of the question   he s going to have to tread very carefully with Comey s replacement. In the meantime, McCabe has assured the Senate that he ll let them know immediately if the White House tries to interfere with the Russia probes in any way at all.Featured image by Zach Gibson via Getty Images", FBI Agents Are Doing Something Unusual In The Wake Of Comey’s Firing

Jon Keyser was confronted by reporter Marshall Zelinger of Denver 7 at a fundraiser and asked questions about suspicious signatures on petitions Keyser had submitted in order to get on the ballot.After initially responding with talking points assuring that he would be on the ballot against Democratic Senator Michael Bennet, Keyser apparently recognized Zelinger for having recently knocked on his door in order to get a comment on the record from the candidate. That s when he relayed his threat.Keyser told Zelinger,  My dog is bigger than you are. He s huge. He s a big guy. Very protective.  Zelinger, obviously surprised by the statement, asked Keyser to clarify. In response, Keyser pointed out that his dog weighs 165 pounds.Watch the video of the tense and odd exchange here:https://www.facebook.com/MZ7NEWS/videos/1313426775337589/Keyser has been under fire because he initially failed to meet the standards for the 10,500 signatures needed to be listed on the ballot in Colorado   1,500 signatures in each of the state s 7 congressional districts. A news investigation also found that several of the signatures were apparently forged:Denver7 has talked to several people whose names appeared on petitions for Jon Keyser in the first congressional district who claim their signatures were forged.  Many of those signatures were collected by a woman named Maureen.A sympathetic judge overruled the Secretary of State s ruling keeping Keyser off the ballot, but now a progressive group in the state is petitioning for an investigation.ProgressNow Colorado sent a letter to Mitch Morrissey and Peter Weir, the District Attorneys in Denver and Jefferson County, respectively.

"May 12, 2017","Donald Trump may spend his time furiously tweeting that the Russia investigation   the one over which he fired FBI Director James Comey after he requested additional resources   is FAKE NEWS, while simultaneously complaining about leaks of classified information that is simultaneously FAKE NEWS and real information, but the rest of us see through his actions that not only is our alleged President hiding about a billion skeletons in his closet, but he has sold out our nation. This is, at this point, something that can be considered a truth   because even Fox News can t avoid commenting on The Donald and his administration s shady practices. When I heard that exchange today between Jeff Mason, White House reporter, and Sean Spicer speaking from the podium in the briefing room for the President of the United States, it took my breath away,  Wallace told fellow Fox host Shep Smith on Friday, adding:That was what in Watergate they called a non-denial denial. He was asked specifically, is there a recording device in the Oval Office of the President of the United States? He said,  I have nothing for you on that.  He could have said no. He could have said yes. He said I have nothing for you on that. That is a non-denial denial. Look, it may just be that the President is trolling the press corps and saying work yourself into a frenzy about this and turns out it nothing. But why would he do that? Why would he want to decrease the credibility which is already in question of this White House and comments that are made from that podium? It seems to me that you re playing a very dangerous game with the currency of the credibility of the President of the United States. Every step he s taken this week has cut into the credibility of this White House, the trust of the people inside the White House,  Wallace said,  and clearly I think the trust that the American people pay to this President and to his White House staff. I ve never seen anything like it and I find it very troubling and troubled. I just don t understand the game that they re playing,  he added.  Cause it isn t a game.

"May 13, 2016","While Donald Trump is considering Arizona s former Governor (and anti-immigrant) Jan Brewer as a prospective vice presidential nominee, the Clinton campaign is eyeing his now arch nemesis   Elizabeth Warren.Warren, who disappointed progressive outlets after refusing multiple times to run for president, has become a viable V.P. choice for both Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton in recent months as the primary battle heats up. In recent weeks, the mounting feud between Warren and Trump over Twitter has become an all out brawl, with the Senator from Massachusetts coming out on top every time.According to the Huffington Post, the Clinton campaign has noticed. Senior and close advisors within the frontrunner s campaign have gone on the record (albeit anonymously) saying  very influential people in the campaign pushing for her  and that her ability to  get under his [Trump s] skin  is thrilling. As one adviser told the Post: You want a running mate who can take the fight to the other side with relish. Geography does not matter, but attitude and talent and energy and bringing excitement to the campaign, Senator Warren does all that. Penny Lee, a former aide to Senator Harry Reid and now a Democratic consultant, summed up why having Warren on the ticket with Clinton would be so beneficial, and why senior advisors have been taking her seriously: She can help validate Clinton with progressives and remind them that despite their differences in the primary, the alternative of the Donald would be untenable. Outlets have speculated for months that Clinton s V.P. nominee would be Julian Castro, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or Sherrod Brown, Senator from Ohio. Castro, however, has ruled out being Clinton s V.P. While turning down the slot for second in command, Castro, who endorsed Clinton last year, has been an active surrogate for the campaign across the country.Going into a general election, Warren could prove an asset not just for the progressive vote, but for independents and moderate Republicans, who referred to Warren in a 2015 study group as  smart,   interesting,   sincere,   capable,   knowledgeable  and  sincere. Drafting Warren to a Vice Presidential spot may bode well in a presidential election, but it could hurt the Democrats  chances at keeping the senate.But with Trump as the GOP prospect, maybe a Clinton-Warren ticket could be the explosive candidacy Democrats need.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images", Hillary Clinton Is Apparently Eyeing Elizabeth Warren As A V.P.

A group of 15 heavily-armed masked gunmen kicked down the door of a Texas border home and opened fire without warning, in a home invasion that injured a 9-year-old boy and his 33-year-old mother.The assault took place in the morning hours, in a rural home near the border city of Harlingen. The gunmen kicked the door down and began shooting at random as soon as they arrived on the scene, Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio said in an interview with Breitbart Texas.The spray of bullets injured the woman and her child, but the woman s husband and other children were not harmed in the shooting, Lucio said. He classified the woman s injuries as minor, but the child remains at a local hospital, where he is listed in stable condition. During the robbery the gunmen yelled out  policia policia  which as we all know is the Spanish word for police,  Lucio said.Preliminary information suggests the robbers attacked the wrong house, as they did not take anything from the property. Sheriff s investigators are still working to identify the gunmen, who are believed to have arrived in at least three vehicles.According to Lucio, the family inside the home is not believed to have any relation to criminal activity, and were simply random victims.As previously reported by Breitbart Texas, home invasions along the Texas border are a different breed of crime, since they often involve gunmen with ties to Mexican drug cartels storming houses to steal drug loads, or abduct human trafficking victims from a rival crew.Via: Breitbart News",CONSEQUENCES OF OPEN BORDERS: 15 Heavily Armed Men Break Into Texas Border Home With 9 Yr Old Boy And Open Fire

Lotz said: In our nation, one of the things we pray for is that some of this craziness would settle down  [but] our nation seems to be shaking its fist in God s face, we re abandoning God as a nation.What happens then is God abandons us and backs away, he he takes his favour and blessing away from us.[If we repent] I think he would begin to reveal the plots of terrorists before they are carried out, even the weather patterns he can control and protect us from violent storms.I think that s why God allows bad things to happen. I think that d why he would allow 9/11 to happen, or the dreadful attack in San Bernardino. To show us we need him.

This rhetoric is beyond dangerous, especially considering how misunderstood transgender people are. This is straight up hate speech, and it should not be tolerated. It s people like this who are responsible for the huge uptick in violence against vulnerable groups of people.This woman does not deserve a platform for her hate.

"May 14, 2017","Donald Trump has been throwing around the false claim that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that there was  no evidence  of collusion between him and his campaign and Russia recently, but a CNN interview just destroyed any hope of Trump ever using that again.On Sunday, Clapper told Jake Tapper that Donald Trump and his Russian friends are attacking our democracy: I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally   and that s the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system   and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally. Asked if he meant Donald Trump, Clapper responded with one word:  Exactly. The founding fathers, in their genius, created a system of three co-equal branches of government and a built-in system of checks and balances,  Clapper said, adding,  I feel as though that is under assault and is eroding. I think each Senator or Congressman has got to, I hope, will think in terms of their own conscience,  Clapper told Tapper.  I hope they speak up. Clapper also said that Trump is wrong to use him to exonerate himself. The bottom line is I don t know if there was collusion, political collusion,  Clapper said.  I don t know of any evidence to it. So I can t refute it, and I can t confirm it. Watch the interview below:", James Clapper Just Publicly Said Trump Is Destroying Our Democracy (VIDEO)
"May 15, 2015"," We do this not because it s legally required, because it s not,  Patton said at a hearing on the agreement.  We do this because we believe it s the right thing to do, both for the victims and their families and for the city. This is historic,  said Mr. Coverson.  The only city in America that has given reparations and passed a reparations ordinance, and given an official apology for the violence that the police have done to citizens. The city of Chicago on Tuesday sought to put to rest one of its most persistent scandals, proposing a $5.5 million reparations fund for dozens of torture victims connected to former Chicago police Cmdr. Jon Burge and his so-called midnight crew of rogue detectives.The proposal, negotiated with a key plaintiff s attorney and supported by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, would offer free city college tuition for victims and their families, free counseling for psychological issues and substance abuse as well as other assistance to more than 50 potential victims. The city would also issue a formal apology, create a permanent memorial recognizing the victims and ensure that eighth- and 10th-grade students attending Chicago Public Schools would be taught about the Burge case and its brutal legacy, cementing the scandal s role in city history.But as much as the proposal seeks to end a painful, controversial era   Emanuel said it would  close this book, the Burge book on the city s history    it is unlikely to stanch the flow of torture claims from victims. A Loyola University Chicago law school dean appointed by a Cook County judge has identified some 20 additional cases in which inmates may have been Burge victims. Other inmates who have made torture claims continue to fight to overturn convictions and win their freedom. And one lawsuit over the torture is pending.Already, this stubborn scandal has cost taxpayers about $100 million in lawsuit settlements, judgments and other legal costs, according to lawyers. It brings it much closer to closure, especially from the city s point of view,  said Flint Taylor, an attorney who has been pursuing the torture issue for decades and was one of the lawyers who negotiated the reparations package.  But it s not done and over.

He still collects a police pension.Burge did not return calls Tuesday to his home in Florida.But John  Jack  Byrne, Burge s former right-hand man, on Tuesday called the reparations deal a  scam perpetuated on taxpayers.

"May 15, 2016","On Sunday, President Barack Obama gave an amazing speech at the Rutgers University graduation ceremony.Speaking to well over 50,000 people, Obama went on a subtle Trump-targeted rant to reject the presumptive Republican nominee s divisive, offensive rhetoric. Although Obama never said Trump s name, there was no mistaking who he was talking about as he spoke against  building a wall. Obama said as his audience applauded: The world is more interconnected than ever before. Building walls won t change that. Obama continued his anti-Trump attack, criticizing some of the GOP front runner s positions   such as Trump s infamous proposal to ban all Muslims from coming into the United States. He continued: Isolating or disparaging Muslims, suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country   that is not just a betrayal of our values   that s not just a betrayal of who we are, it would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in the fight against violent extremism.  Addressing the 12,000 graduates listening to his speech, Obama urged them to rise above the  strain of anti-intellectualism  that Trump has encouraged in his race for the White House. In the process, Obama couldn t help but laugh as he exposed Trump for the idiot that he is. So, class of 2016 let me be as clear as I can be: In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. It s not cool to not know what you re talking about. It s not  keeping it real  or  telling it like it is.  It s not challenging political correctness. That s just not knowing what you re talking about. You can watch Obama deliver this powerful message below:Obama urged graduates to remain dedicated to learning the truth and keeping an open mind, warning them that only exposing themselves to information that confirms their own beliefs could result in ignorance. Ironically the flood of information hasn t made us more discerning of the truth. It s just made us more confident of our ignorance. Taking the Republican party to task, Obama added that when politicians are  not held accountable for repeating falsehoods and just making stuff up, while actual experts are dismissed as elitists, then we ve got a problem. Soothing frustrations felt throughout the campaigns in this election, Obama reiterated his previous comments on income inequality that he d given during a commencement address at Howard University last week. Obama reminded the graduates how important it was to vote and be involved in the political process: The reason some of these things have not happened even though the majority of people have approved, it s really simple. It s because a huge chunk of Americans, especially young people do not vote. Apathy has consequences. You can watch Obama s full speech below   it serves as a reminder to America s youth that they are powerful, and that they should use that power to unify instead of divide our country.Featured image via Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / Getty Images", Obama Shreds Trump In Powerful Message To Graduates: ‘Ignorance Is Not A Virtue’ (VIDEO)
"May 15, 2017","Donald Trump is a small child in a 70-year-old man s body who somehow managed to get elected president of the United States. It seems that world leaders are aware of this, and therefore are now devising methods to deal with him as such. Case in point   Trump s very first summit with the other member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).NATO officials are well aware that Trump has the attention span of a toddler who needs a nap, so they are going to keep the topics simple and make sure that any remarks are limited to two to four minute bursts. In addition to the shortened speeches and elementary subject matter, the summit will have no formal statement after the meeting with the heads of state for the 28 countries in the NATO alliance. Officials in the know say that the people involved in setting all of this up to accommodate Trump s childlike ways are really scrambling, as the summit is set to commence on May 25. In short- they are going to Trump- proof the event. From Uproxx: It s kind of ridiculous how they are preparing to deal with Trump,  said one source briefed extensively on the meeting s preparations.  It s like they re preparing to deal with a child   someone with a short attention span and mood who has no knowledge of NATO, no interest in in-depth policy issues, nothing,  said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  They re freaking out. People are scared of his unpredictability, intimidated by how he might react knowing the president might speak his mind   or tweet his mind,  [a] former official said. Or, as another current senior NATO official put it before the meeting:  We re bracing for impact. As if this isn t bad enough, a big topic of this particular meeting of the NATO alliance will be how to share the costs and other burdens associated with NATO. Of course, we all remember how Trump actually gave German Chancellor Angela Merkel a bill for supposed monies she owes to NATO on her very first visit to our country. So, there s no telling what he ll say to other member nations on this topic at the summit. This worry has not escaped the international officials preparing for this event. Again, from Uproxx: His views of burden-sharing seem to be more ambitious than past presidents,  and that could become a source of tension at the big NATO confab, said Alexander Vershbow, former deputy secretary-general of NATO.  The burden-sharing conversation may not go entirely smoothly. This is beyond embarrassing. With each passing day, Trump s childish temperament, incompetence, and buffoonery lessens America s standing in the world. When will the Republicans in Congress wake up, admit they made a mistake by getting this man elected, and start preparing to oust him from office?Only time will tell.

I ve been watching politics since (Dwight) Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and Obama is my favorite, favorite president,  Taylor said in an interview Wednesday.  I am just thankful for every day that he s in office. I am so proud that he represents my country and I think he represents me   I think he represents the America that I know. Taylor, 67, is a recipient of the National Medal of Arts. The pop icon performed  America the Beautiful  at Obama s second inauguration in 2013. I had a really tough time during the Cheney-Bush years, I did, and I had a hard time accepting that that administration represented me because I don t think they did,  Taylor said.The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer also called Obama s family  precious  and said he appreciates the U.S. leader because he s  sane  and  balanced. He promised to give us a health care system, it s a work in progress, but he has put us on a road to that,  Taylor said.  I m so grateful for what he s done for gay rights and for the emancipation of gay people. Particularly from my point of view, I think that was so overdue and so important, and so important for America to be ahead of the curve on this. Taylor criticized Congress in Obama s defense. I ve never seen a Congress that has been so obstructive and so contrary and so committed to doing anything that will foul up this administration. I just think it s an absolute scandal that he has had so little cooperation,  he said.  So anyway, you hit a nerve and I ll go on forever. But I ll just say it a third time: Every day that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are in the White House is a day that I am thankful for. Obama isn t the only politician Taylor is supporting: The singer said he s on the Hillary Rodham Clinton train, too. And aside from the fact that she s a woman running, she s the right person.   The whole point   black or white, male or female, gay or straight, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, atheist   it doesn t matter what these other connections are,  he said.  Our country needs to come together and the question is,  Is this public servant someone who will bring us together?  And I think she is.

That s because Webb accidentally left a couple of porn sites open in his browser which can be seen in the image he shared.Here s the screenshot that Webb shared:Here s a closer look at the screenshot:The story gets even more hilarious, considering that Webb was already involved in another controversy. Webb had failed to file his FEC report on time, which he claims that he could not do because of a virus that had infected his computer.The post has been up for 11 hours at the time of this writing. Since Webb posted the screenshot, he has made two more posts to his Facebook page. In the first one, he writes a very long letter of condemnation towards those mocking him. He begins the post by writing,  SEE HOW DIRTY YOU ARE? In the post, Webb writes after that one is far more bizarre. He begins the post by saying  THANKS FOR THE TAB CHECK, RANGER BUDDIES!  This is followed by a Bible verse: For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.  Psalm 100:5The post is accompanied with a screenshot that shows his page s reach. That s because he is proud of the negative attention he has received. Webb goes on to write that the  the Lord  has lifted him up.

Rather than make nice, Kelly seized the opportunity to call out Trump to his face on some of the disgusting things he s said about women (including Kelly) over the years. His reaction was  unexpected.In the midst of Trump s lengthy interview with Kelly, he was asked about the way he disparagingly called women  bimbos.  For once, Trump, whose face went from orange to deep red, was tongue-tied, awkward and  low energy.  He was extremely off his game   and it was cringe worthy to watch.Kelly brought up Trump s Twitter activity, which often features the candidate for   and it s important to keep this in mind  President of the United States passing along messages from his fans that include sexist, racist, or violent remarks. Trump s defense was lame:  You would be surprised at the ones I don t retweet. Kelly persisted:  Bimbo? Uncharacteristically, Trump could only meekly sputter mindlessly. No come back.

It s about the messaging   to young girls and to other women. Trump had no response. His message to young girls and to other women is one backed by sexism and objectification.

"May 17, 2017","The Department of Justice announced on Wednesday that former FBI Director Robert Mueller has been named as special counsel for the investigation into Donald Trump s likely collusion with Russia. After a week that has rocked Washington to the core and left the White House in utter chaos, the statement released by Trump in response to the news that special counsel had been appointed shows just how bad things really are within the Oval Office.The statement consisted of a mere three sentences: As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know   there was no collusion between my campaign an any foreign entity. I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country. The first thing that stands out about this statement is that it is distinctly un-Trumplike. And this uncharacteristically coherent statement also shows the White House is understanding the gravity of the current situation. Despite the words themselves, these three short sentences show that Trump clearly knows he is in deep sh*t.After he fired FBI Director James Comey, news broke that Trump had tried to pressure him to drop the Russia investigation and Trump s Twitter feed went silent. Something very unusual for the tweeter-in-chief. Until he released this short statement, the only remarks he had made were at a commencement speech for the U.S. Coast Guard, where he whined that he had been treated more unfairly than any other president in history. (Insert eye roll here.)At this point, pundits are speculating that Trump may have hired an outside attorney who is telling him to shut the hell up. No one really knows whether he has sought counsel or not, although he clearly should if he hasn t because he s definitely going to need it. But his statement and his silence make one thing very clear, Trump knows he s in trouble. He may want it all to just go away, but the appointment of special counsel guarantees that this  matter  will NOT be  concluding quickly.

"May 18, 2016","Former Utah Senator Bob Bennett lay in a hospital bed fighting a losing battle against pancreatic cancer and the ravages of a stroke, but in his last days he wanted to atone for the damage Donald Trump has done to Muslims in America.Instead, with a slight slurring in his words, Bennett drew them close to express a dying wish:  Are there any Muslims in the hospital?  he asked. I d love to go up to every single one of them to thank them for being in this country, and apologize to them on behalf of the Republican Party for Donald Trump,  Bennett told his wife and son, both of whom relayed this story to The Daily Beast.Bennett served in the Senate for three terms, but his vote in favor of TARP left him vulnerable in the 2010 wave and he lost to Tea Party supporter Mike Lee.In his last days he also spoke to the Deseret News newspaper in Utah and told them,  There s a lot of Muslims here in this area. I m glad they re here. Over the course of his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Muslims. He spoke out in favor of a ban on Muslim travel to the United States, and argued for a system to track Muslim citizens. His Islamophobia brought the ire of newly elected London mayor Sadiq Khan, who is Muslim.Khan told Time magazine,  If Donald Trump becomes the President, I ll be stopped from going there by virtue of my faith, which means I can t engage with American mayors and swap ideas. Conservative tacticians thought those sorts of tactics would win London and they were wrong. I m confident that Donald Trump s approach to politics won t win in America.

"May 18, 2017","In a move that absolutely nobody could have seen coming, President Trump has lashed out about the newly-appointed special counsel tasked with looking into his campaign s dealings with Russian intelligence services. Trump told reporters on Thursday afternoon,  I believe it hurts our country terribly, because it shows we re a divided, mixed-up, not-unified country. And we have very important things to be doing right now, whether it s trade deals, whether it s military, whether it s stopping nuclear   all of the things that we discussed today. And I think this shows a very divided country. President Trump used his time with reporters to attack Democrats as well, blaming them for the multiple investigations into his ongoing backroom deals with Russia. He said,  It also happens to be a pure excuse for the Democrats having lost an election that they should have easily won because of the Electoral College being slanted so much in their way. That s all this is. President Trump s initial reaction to news that a special counsel has been appointed.That stands in sharp contrast to the statement that President Trump released yesterday, when he learned that a special counsel had been appointed. Trump also seemed to be concerned over how investigations into his presidency look to the rest of the world, saying  I think it shows division, and it shows that we re not together as a country. And I think it s a very, very negative thing. And hopefully, this can go quickly, because we have to show unity if we re going to do great things with respect to the rest of the world. Perhaps the biggest shock is that Trump reportedly still wants Michael Flynn to be a part of his administration. The President is convinced that Flynn will be found innocent, despite mounting evidence to the contrary.

However, every time Trump insults or embarrasses the New Jersey governor, Christie loses even more of the public s respect. This most recent incident further proves that not even Trump has an ounce of respect for Christie, and is really just using him as a prop to make his campaign events more entertaining for his audience.Previously, Trump has humiliated Christie by basically holding him hostage on stage after the NJ governor endorsed him, and dismissing him like an unwanted child during a Tennessee rally by telling him to  get on that plane and go home . This latest incident just adds even more insult to injury. At a campaign event specifically aimed to help Christie get out of his $200,000 debt from his failed campaign   which is embarrassing enough to admit   Trump decided to make matters worse by teasing Christie about something he s always been sensitive about   his weight.Trump had gone on a rant about Nabisco moving factories to Mexico, and mentioned that he was done eating Oreos. Desperately searching for a punchline, Trump looked at Christie, pointed his little index finger at him and said: Neither is Chris! You re not eating Oreos anymore! The crowd erupted into awkward laughter and Trump tried to  soften the blow  by repeating the joke and bringing himself into the equation. No more Oreos, for either of us, Chris! Don t feel bad!

"May 19, 2017","By now, we re all aware of how Donald Trump repeatedly humiliates the nation with his handshake games. He awkwardly tugs people in some kind of attempted power play, holds on to their hands for far too long, and, in the most inhospitable move of all, attempts to give them unwanted hugs.Well, during the 2016 presidential campaign, it appears that Hillary Clinton s team had observed this bizarre behavior, and made sure that when she met Trump for debates, Hillary was ready to avoid the gross awkwardness of an unwanted Trump hug in front of millions of debate viewers.On Friday, longtime Clinton aide Phillip Reines released a rare clip from debate prep, in which he played Donald Trump. In the clip, Reines as Trump attempts to hug Hillary, and she runs away from him.While funny, it really does show just how bizarre Trump s behavior is, and it speaks to a larger issue with his mental state. Anyone who acts like that with people they are opposing politically, or worse, meeting for the purpose of diplomacy, has serious issues.We re not the only ones who think so, either. Just Google the videos of Trump s Oval Office meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, or any other world leader Trump has behaved this way with. They all look either disgusted, alarmed, horrified, insulted, or some combination thereof.

Adding: He starts out his conversation with the same punch line he uses here in the very beginning of this video saying,  Hey there I don t mean to bother you but I just bought this maxi dress for my wife at Ross and I was kinda worried about the sheerness of it. Spivey explains what happened the first time she got approached by Polizzi: Whiles he s asking these questions he s filming you with his cell phone, and I knew he was by the way he was holding his phone. I had this feeling there was way more to what he was doing than just asking questions, it was very routine for him like he s been doing this for a long time. So I went immediately to the front and reported him, they called the cops and he was banned from that publix. It was NOT illegal what he was doing. When Spivey was approached by Polizzi again in Target, she sprung into action. She confronted him, and as she was chasing him, shouted for someone to call the police. Unfortunately, he s still out there, so Spivey asks that if you run into him to contact the Nassau County Sheriff s Office, who is currently looking for possible victims.According to The Daily Mail: Police confirmed Polizzi has previously been charged with video voyeurism and issued an appeal last week for any other potential victims to come forward.Since then, scores of women have complained that they were approached by the man in similar scenarios. The biggest thing Spivey wanted out of this video and confrontation was to make sure this slimeball s face gets out there to the public to warn them. It s unbelievable, yet believable, that a man like this is free to walk around and not be taken into custody with several victims claiming it was him.Let s hope he gets caught soon by more than just Spivey, but by the police.Watch the confrontation here:Featured image via video screen capture", WATCH: Karma Strikes Disgusting Voyeur At Target When Woman Confronts And Chases Him

Despite the fact that Trump is a one man What Not to Wear (ties too long, suits too big and that hair!), #45 is obsessed with what everyone around him wears. Kushner s monstrosity reportedly came courtesy of Trump s  stylist  which is located across the street from Trump s New York residence. It s not tough to imagine him telling Kushner to get  the Trump. On a subconscious level, though, this hair style speaks to more than just trying to suck up to the boss. It s about a full makeover, which with Kushner, includes his principles.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images", Something Weird Is Happening With Jared Kushner’s Hair

"May 20, 2016","Donald Trump gave a speech to the NRA, who then endorsed him for President. That seems a little odd, given Trump s past support for certain gun control measures that the NRA wouldn t touch with a 60 foot pole. It s especially telling that, as recently as 2012, Trump supported President Obama s attempts at reasonable gun legislation following Sandy Hook. Now, though? They seem to have forgotten.Back then, President Obama said: We can t tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change. We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex, and that is true. No single law no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world, or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society. But that can t be an excuse for inaction. Surely, we can do better than this. Trump s response to that?Back in 2000, he also wrote in his book, The America We Deserve: I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. Those are both things the NRA can t stand. Trump used to call out Republicans for  walking the NRA line,  and  refuse even limited restrictions  on firearms too, which is really all Democrats want. The NRA, however, would have us believe that Obama is coming for our guns any minute now, and, if not him, then the next Democratic president will. Somehow, some way, some Democratic president will take everyone s guns.We have to wonder when that s actually going to happen, since they keep saying it s just a matter of time.So Trump used to be pro-gun legislation, and now he s anti-gun legislation enough for an NRA endorsement. The NRA has a short memory, apparently. While people do evolve on their positions as they learn new facts, this is pandering, because the NRA willfully ignores the facts.Trump, however, must enjoy pandering, because he does an awful lot of it.He s also pandering to the extreme end of the pro-gun crowd, even proudly accepting an endorsement from a Sandy Hook truther back in January. In March, Pastor Carl Gallups gave a speech where he said that Trump was the  pragmatic choice  for Christians. However, Gallups  website calls the Sandy Hook massacre a gun-grab hoax, and allegedly has evidence proving that. He also said that there s no question that the victims  parents are all fakes.The fact that it doesn t occur to the guns-everywhere crowd that Trump s support for the NRA, the gun nuts, and everything they stand for, is an illusion in order to gain support he knows he needs boggles the mind. Of course, it s hard to catch the liar of liars in a lie, because he s got excuses for everything and he s good at making his lies sound perfectly reasonable. He s very likely snowed the NRA here.Featured image by Scott Olson/Getty Images"," The NRA Endorsed Trump, But They’d Have Ended Him In 2012 For His Comments Right After Sandy Hook"

Green told the audience he believes that Trump s actions amounted to an admission of obstruction of justice, and the tweet constituted intimidation. It is imperative, he said, that the House move to indict Trump; nothing less than the rule of law is at stake.Source: Mother JonesIn a town hall meeting on Saturday, Green played some of the threatening voicemails that have been left at his office by Trump supporters.

Unfortunately for them, however, more and more black people are turning on the Obamas and seeing them for what they really are.After seeing Michelle Obama s graduation speech at the predominantly black Tuskegee University, TV show host Alfonso Rachel knew that he could stay silent no longer.

"May 21, 2016","Ben Carson was (very) briefly the Republican frontrunner for President of the United States   and now he s getting demoted by Donald Trump s campaign for being too big a liability. The campaign which once tweeted a picture of Trump eating a taco bowl with the caption  I love Hispanics  thinks Carson makes them look bad.And sadly, they re probably right.Ben Carson has managed to step on every rake in the yard in his bumbling attempt to help Trump get elected president. He s confided to reporters (on the record) that Trump might make a terrible president, but at least  we re only looking at four years. How bad has Carson been for Trump? Dubbing him the  worst surrogate ever  CBS News  Emily Schultheis pegged Carson early on:A campaign surrogate s job is to travel across the country and go on TV, saying nice things about the candidate and helping boost his or her chances at the presidency.What a campaign surrogate is not, however, supposed to do, is suggest their candidate is a bad person, admit he has a Twitter problem and an issue with  humility,  defend that candidate by suggesting a TV anchor has been charged with a crime, and reassure skeptics that, even if your candidate is a terrible president, it s only for four years.So when Carson made headlines yet again for screwing up   this time naming a list of potential vice presidents Trump was considering including Alaskan campaign death knell Sarah Palin   Carson was removed from the vice presidential planning group. Or as Carson s spin team meekly put it, he asked to be removed because he had many more super important jobs to do.That lie was exposed in less than a week. The real story is that Trump kicked Carson to the curb because Carson had absolutely no idea what he was doing.Three sources close to the Trump campaign said Carson didn t leave on his own. He was pushed.According to sources close to Trump s campaign, Carson was demoted after Trump specifically wanted him to head up the VP selection team. He submitted names that he thought would be valuable picks and inevitably lost his top spot days later. Carson allegedly called Trump afterwards and was angry that the situation played out like this.At this point, it s hard not to feel bad for Carson. Having seen the highs of being a front-runner, Carson got smoked in Iowa thanks to a vicious lie spread by Ted Cruz. Later he would be pulled into a literal closet to hear Ted Cruz tell him  sorry not sorry.  Only to finally give up and throw his lot in with Trump   a man who once called him a pathological liar barely above a child molester. Now that same man is firing him and only because Carson s mouth almost never bothers communicating with his brain before saying things like  He has some major defects, there s no question about it, just like the rest of us. But before we let Carson s sadsack routine tug on our heartstrings, let s remember that this is a man who ran for president on the premise that the Egyptian pyramids were grain silos only to give up and throw his weight behind a man he seems to have nothing but contempt for just to cling a bit longer to the political spotlight. Carson s right about one thing, he does have major defects.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"," Ben Carson Gets Humiliating Trump Campaign Demotion – Claims He Requested it, Fools No One"
"May 21, 2017","After months of mocking Hillary Clinton s stamina because she dared catch pneumonia during the presidential campaign, Donald Trump is reportedly so  exhausted  just three days into his nine day overseas trip that he s screwing up speeches and having his daughter Ivanka fill in.During a speech to Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Trump referred to  Islamic extremism  instead of  Islamist extremism,  as had been written. While that may sound like a distinction without a difference, Reuters explains:The term  Islamist extremism  refers to Islamism as a political movement rather than Islam as a religion, a distinction that the Republican president had frequently criticized the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, for making.Trump often referred to  Islamic extremism  and criticized President Obama for using the term  Islamist extremism.  But, because he is playing nicey nicey with the Saudis, he tried to modulate his rhetoric, but he failed.

"May 22, 2015","The Friday document dump today included 300 of the thousands of yet to be released Clinton e-mails. How convenient to release these on a holiday weekend. We re all being scammed in all this because these are the e-mails hand picked by Hillaries minions. We won t get to the truth because it was destroyed. This entire thing is smelling to high heaven The State Department released its first round of emails from Hillary Clinton s time as Secretary of State on Friday, offering a new look at her handling of the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.The roughly 300 emails, about 850 pages, are part of the 30,000 that she turned over to State from her private email server, which she used almost exclusively to conduct both private and public business during her time at State. They reveal a range of correspondence from Clinton, everything from policy briefs to scheduling requests to friendly exchanges with staff.White House press secretary Josh Earnest says the new emails  do not change in any way anyone s understanding  of what happened in Benghazi, and the State Department reiterated the same in a tweet. The emails we release today do not change the essential facts or our understanding of the events before, during, or after the attacks,  the department tweeted.Clinton herself commented on the release at a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Friday, telling reporters she was happy they were out but was waiting for more. It s beginning. I just would like to see it expedited, so we could get more of them out more quickly,  she said.Below, a collection of some of the most newsworthy tidbits from the emails:A supportive boss In one email, sent four days before Christmas in 2012, Clinton sent a note to her entire State Department staff, acknowledging a  challenging week.  She had fainted about a week prior and suffered a concussion, which prevented her from testifying before House and Senate committees on the attacks. We need to learn from the tragedy in Benghazi and make every possible improvement   and we will,  she wrote in the five-paragraph note.One day earlier, Clinton wrote in an email to two top aides headed to the Hill on her behalf:  I ll be nursing my cracked head and cheering you on as you  remain calm and carry on!' One of those aides, Tom Nides, hints that he s not entirely excited about the grilling.Clinton replies:  Well, what doesn t kill you, makes you stronger (as I have rationalized for years), so just survive and you ll have triumphed! In most emails, she s referred to simply as  H. Stress over Benghazi scrutiny One email hints at the scrutiny the State Department was facing over Clinton s response to the Benghazi attacks. In their remarks the day after the attack, both Clinton and President Barack Obama made reference to an anti-Muslim video that some intelligence initially suggested prompted the attacks, a claim that was later found to be mistaken.On Sept. 24, 2012, Jake Sullivan, Clinton s deputy chief of staff at State, forwards her a 24-page document compiling all of the statements she had made after the attacks, and reassures her that she was careful in her wording. You never said spontaneous or characterized the motives. In fact you were careful in your first statement to say we were assessing motive and method,  he says.Sullivan also writes:  The way you treated the video in the Libya context was to say that some sought to *justify* the attack on that basis. Advice on foreign affairs Clinton received advice on foreign affairs from a range of former advisers from outside of the department, including Sidney Blumenthal, the former Clinton White House aide who s drawn scrutiny for issuing over two dozen memos to Clinton on Libya while also advising businesses looking to break into post-Gaddafi Libya.The emails reveal that Clinton often read, commented on and forwarded Blumenthal s memos   which laid out information obtained from his own sources on the situation in Libya   to Sullivan. Blumenthal will comply with a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee on Benghazi this week after his role in advising Clinton emerged.In a September 2012 email, Burns Strider, a senior adviser and director of Faith and Values Outreach on Clinton s 2008 campaign, forwards her a post from CNN s Belief blog by Stephen Prothero titled  My Take: A deadly link between Islamic and anti-Islamic terrorists.  She typically forwards these to State Department aides.Libya security concerns In the years leading up to the attack covered by the emails, there were a number of hints at the decaying security situation in Libya   key sticking point for Republican critics of Clinton s performance at State. Many believe she ignored warnings that the security there was declining and showed poor judgment in failing to beef up protection for U.S. officials there.In June of 2011, Sullivan emailed Hillary warning of a  credible threat against the hotel that our team is using,  and told her security officials would be moving personnel to other locations.She received an update in 2011 from Stevens on how fragile the security forces were in the country. The police chief is a university professor who took on these police duties after the revolution. According to the police chief, there are only 3,000 police in the Benghazi area, down from 6,000 prior to the revolution. Many police simply did not return to their jobs after the revolution, as they feared retaliation, Another email, sent in February of 2012 by then Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz, warned of  concern here that continuing rivalries among the militias remains dangerous from the perspective of the havoc they can wreak with their firepower and their continued control of select turf. Congratulations and condolences on Benghazi In the days following the attacks, Clinton received a stream of condolences and congratulations from diplomats, lawmakers and world leaders on her handling of the situation.On Sept. 13, Clinton is forwarded an email from U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro, who says that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called him to offer  profound condolences  about the Benghazi attack.  He said Israelis know too well how difficult these moments are, and he wanted us all to know that Israelis stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us at such a difficult time,  Shapiro writes.Christian Brose, Sen. John McCain s national security adviser, emailed Sullivan on Sept. 12, 2012, the day Clinton gave a speech honoring those who died in the attacks, sending his boss s compliments.  What a wonderful, strong and moving statement by your boss. Please tell her how much Sen. McCain appreciated it. Me too,  he wrote.Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates also sent his condolences.Intelligence holes? One October 2012 email underscores the limits of U.S. intelligence. Clinton emailed senior aide Cheryl Mills asking about an NPR report on the attacks. I just heard an NPR report about the CIA station chief in Tripoli sending a cable on 9/12 saying there was no demo etc.,  she wrote.  Do you know about this? Thoughts on the media A transcript of an interview with Wall Street Journal Reporter Monica Langley was circulated among a few top aides with commentary from Philippe Reines, a longtime spokesman for Clinton.He declared the October 10, 2012, conversation as an  awesome interview.  But he went on to say that Langley violated Clinton s personal space, by moving her chair knee-to-knee with the secretary, comparing it to  the dental hygienist rolling around the floor to get the best access to your mouth depending on which tooth she was trying to get access to. I ve never seen a westerner invade her space like that,  Reines wrote. But he went on to describe the interview as  wonderful. One of the best interviews I ve ever witnesses. Wish it were on live TV.

"May 22, 2016","Prosecutors allege that bone cement manufactured by Norian and its parent company, Synthes, was used to conduct  human experimentation,  resulting in a string of deaths over the past several years.As Fortune reports here, the deaths were the result of spinal injections of a product called Norian XR, described as  a cement that has the unique capacity to turn into bone when injected into the human skeleton. Norian XR was never approved by the FDA for use in the human spine. To the contrary, the FDA required the company to mark the product as  not approved  for such use.Experiments conducted at the University of Washington exposed the dangers of using the bone cement to treat human spine injuries as early as 2002. When tested on pigs, the Norian XR caused severe blood clotting, resulting in the deaths of the animals.Synthes had acquired the California-based Norian Corporation with the intention of altering Norian XR for use in spinal treatments. Nothing was going to stand in the way of company profits.Prosecutors say that the company launched a scheme specifically designed to get around FDA approval.As The Dallas Morning News reports here:CEO Hansjorg Wyss directed a few sites to perform 60 to 80 procedures in spinal surgeries using the Norian bone cement and to publish clinical results. He recruited surgeons to test-market the product on patients, court records show.The patients who were exposed to the experimental treatment were never told that the product was not approved by the FDA.By 2010, a string of deaths had been attributed to the company s human experimentation.Lois Eskind, age 70, was injected with Norian XR while a company salesperson watched. The Dallas Morning News reports,  The product leaked into Eskind s veins and led to the clotting that killed her. The company did not inform the FDA of Eskind s death. They continued to experiment on human beings without their knowledge or consent, causing the deaths of many other people, including Reba Golden and Joan Bryant.In 2010, Synthes and Norian, along with four top executives, were convicted of conducting unauthorized clinical trials on humans. Norian paid a $22.5 million penalty, while Synthes paid $669,800 fine. The executives went to prison.The families of Golden and Bryant recently filed a civil suit against Dr. Jens Chapman, Synthes, Norian, the University of Washington, Harborview Medical Center and Washington state. The first trial is set to begin in June.The crimes committed by these companies are a chilling example of the risks we take in allowing our healthcare system to be controlled by profit-motivated corporations like Synthes.Featured image via Pixabay Public Domain", String Of Deaths Linked To Human Experimentation By Bone Cement Company
"May 22, 2017","Last week, disgraced former Fox News chief, Roger Ailes, died. I know you re supposed to speak reverentially about the dead, but Ailes was toxic. He was a misogynist, a racist and he turned low information voters into a key demographic. Without Roger Ailes, we would likely not have had two illegal wars and we wouldn t have BLOTUS Trump.For some, though, their toxic relationship with Ailes was far more personal. One notable example of a life he ruined was Monica Lewinsky, who, to this day, is best known as the woman who gave Bill Clinton a blow job. Lewinsky penned her own obituary for Ailes, and there was no reverence. There was resentment and a whole lot of truth. This is not another obituary for Roger Ailes,  Lewinsky wrote,  who died last week 10 months after being ousted at Fox News. It is, I hope, instead an obituary for the culture he purveyed   a culture that affected me profoundly and personally. Hard to deny that. Thanks to Fox News, a consensual affair suddenly became the scandal of the decade   it was the story that was supposed to undo a presidency. Without Lewinsky, Fox News might not be Fox News today.Some experts have noted that viewers found Fox for the first time because of the crisis. John Moody, a Fox executive editor, reflected on that period:  The Lewinsky saga put us on the news map.  As he put it in another interview:  Monica was a news channel s dream come true. But amid that, Fox created the culture of mean. They somehow managed to portray Bill Clinton as a predator (ironic given the culture at Fox News) while portraying Lewinsky as unworthy of a powerful man s attentions.Their dream was my nightmare. My character, my looks and my life were picked apart mercilessly. Truth and fiction mixed at random in the service of higher ratings. My family and I huddled at home, worried about my going to jail   I was the original target of Ken Starr s investigation, threatened with 27 years for having been accused of signing a false affidavit, obstructing justice, suborning perjury and other crimes   or worse, me taking my own life. Meantime, Mr. Ailes huddled with his employees at Fox News, dictating a lineup of talking heads to best exploit this personal and national tragedy.Lewinsky lamented the fact that it wasn t only Fox, and that Fox changed the media landscape. Even MSNBC was committed to almost non-stop coverage of the scandal that shouldn t have been. The internet, though, made it much, much worse.Just as television news was devolving into a modern coliseum, the internet came along and compounded this culture of shame and vitriol. Remember: The story of my affair was not broken by The Washington Post, The New York Times or the networks, but online by the Drudge Report. The comments on television and online were excruciating. I ceased being a three-dimensional person. Instead I became a whore, a bimbo, a slut and worse. Just days after the story broke, Fox asked its viewers to vote on this pressing question: Is Monica Lewinsky an  average girl  or a  young tramp looking for thrills ?Lewinsky isn t cheering for Fox News to be cancelled. In fact, she praised them for firing Ailes and Bill O Reilly, both of whom were accused of being serial sexual harassers. She also said she believes that credible conservative voices should be heard, that it s an important part of a healthy democracy. However, Ailes helped create the current cruel and toxic political environment, and for that, he won t be missed.Featured image of Monica Lewinsky via Bryan Bedder/Getty Images | Featured image of Roger Ailes via Handout/Getty Images.", Monica Lewinsky Wrote An Obituary For Roger Ailes And It Was BRUTAL

"May 23, 2016","Alexander McCoy, a veteran of the U.S. Marines, helped led a protest outside Donald Trump s Trump Tower on Monday. The event was organized to shame Trump after recent reports revealed that he lied when he said he had raised $6 million to support veterans earlier in the year.In the video, McCoy explained that the episode shows that Trump  has not shown any honor in his actions or his policies.  He added,  he would make a reckless and dangerous commander-in-chief, and as Americans we would be fundamentally less safe with Donald Trump as president.  McCoy also referred to Trump as a  fraud. The veterans assembled outside the New York City landmark to raise awareness of what Trump has done.Former Marine Alexander McCoy and Army veteran Perry O Brien, who led the demonstration, have repeatedly said that Trump overstated the amount of money he raised at a Jan. 28 fundraiser for veterans causes to inflate his reputation among Republicans. (Of) the $6 million that Donald Trump supposedly raised for veterans charities, a significant portion of that money either never existed or it just vanished,  O Brien, 34, who served in Afghanistan for over three years, told the Daily News as his fellow veterans and their supporters touted signs reading  Vets Vs Hate. Trump put on the so-called fundraiser on the night he chose to skip out on the Republican primary debate because he was afraid of tough questioning from Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly. Trump initially claimed the event had raised $6 million, and spent the next few days praising himself for the accomplishment, as part of the publicity drive for his campaign during the primaries.Subsequent reports showed that the money raised was about half that amount, according to the Daily News. Some veterans groups told the paper that they haven t received any of the money Trump promised in his first, extravagant claims.Featured image via YouTube", WATCH: This US Marine Veteran Went To Trump Tower To Warn The World About The ‘Fraud’ Inside (VIDEO)

According to the comedian, Trump is a soulless  goon  and it makes him sick that he is representing the United States. (Boy can I relate to that feel.) I m disappointed that this man is representing me and my country. It makes me sick, Letterman told GQ.Letterman has known Trump for a long time and said that he doesn t regret having the former reality tv star on his show numerous times over the years. No, no reason to regret it . But we always looked forward to having him on. He was a great guest. He was just a big, wealthy dope who d come on and we would make fun of his hair. I would refer to him as a slumlord,  Letterman continued.However, Letterman said that since that time, Trump has managed to prove to the world that he is completely  without a soul. But now, this goon  I don t know. He s demonstrated himself to be a man without a core, a man without a soul. Is there a guy in there?  Letterman asked.This isn t the first time Letterman has stepped forward to denounce Trump. In March, the former host of The Late Show called out  Trumpy  for the steady stream of lies that he spews forth without even a hint of regret. How do you know if Donald Trump is lying? His lips are moving,  Letterman said.  If we get a president sometime soon who does not have a mental disorder, Twitter will be useful,  he added.Letterman told GQ that he would love to have the opportunity to sit down with Trump one on one in a tv studio so he could ask him this important question: All right, Don: What the fuck happened?

As it turns out, dictators don t generally respond well to satire and Oliver has found himself in a bit of a brush up with the Kremlin-backed ruler of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov   all over a lost cat.In a segment on HBO s Last Week Tonight, Oliver ridiculed the friend of Putin after Kadyrov took to Instagram to ask the world to help find his cat, which he called a  toyger,  which as you might guess, is a cat that has been bred to look like a tiger cub.         .          .      ,            .          -   .      ,    -   ,              ,        ,        .          .  ,      -       .        ,      .  ,              .            ,    -   .      ???????? #  #  #  #  # A photo posted by Ramzan Kadyrov (@kadyrov_95) on May 16, 2016 at 4:29am PDTUnfortunately, without the help of unreliable translation software, we don t know exactly what the post says, but he did ask for help and he did say that  we have begun to seriously worry,  asking people who have seen the cat to get in touch.Now, Kadyrov is not a nice person, despite his apparent love of cats, so Oliver couldn t leave it alone. Not only did he release the video, but Oliver trolled the leader on Twitter.Here s the video:And this: .@RKadyrov Is this your cat? pic.twitter.com/2UacV3km7J  John Oliver (@iamjohnoliver) May 23, 2016Featured image via Twitter. Kadyrov was not happy. Apparently, he follows American social media as carefully as the equally thin-skinned Donald Trump. He once again took to Instagram to mock Oliver, this time in English, although the text reads like he ran it through one of those terrible translation programs.Recently my  tiger cat  has left the house. It happens in spring from time to time. He also needs to meet with friends, mingle and share news. By cat rumors he has in our district a familiar she-cat with which he s going to start a family. I m sure that after spring affairs, the cat will return to native walls. Perhaps, he ll bring his sweet love with him. I got used to share with my friends in Instagram with all news, including cat issues. And this time I didn t want to leave as a secret the cat s adventures. I receive lots of photos. Some people say that they saw the cat in Vladivostok, Japan, Iceland, New Zealand, and even in the Oval Office of the White House! I am grateful to all, but this is NOT my cat. It became known that even the American TV channel  HBO  joined to search. The anchorman comedian   John Oliver asks millions of viewers to look for a cat. I knew long ago that in the USA unevenly breathe to my younger friends. One day horses aren t allowed to jump, the other   a cat is a real star of a show. Oliver laments a fact that we put on t-shirts with a photo of the President of Russia   Vladimir Putin. Yes, millions of people rejoice t-shirts with the image of the national leader. For this purpose, there is a good motivation. Vladimir Vladimirovich is a wise, courageous, resolute Head, who managed to withstand unfriendly campaign, which is conducted by the USA and its assistants. Thanks to Putin, we have crushed terrorists among whom there were also citizens of the USA, and European citizens. The country directed by Obama under the guise of peacekeeping operations spark new wars and bloody internal conflicts, in which die millions of people. Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria  That s why there is nothing surprising that Oliver also got a wish to appear publicly in a T-shirt with an image of Putin, but not Obama. #Kadyrov #Russia #Chechnya #USA #HBO #Oliver #findkadyrovscat #Ihavenotseenyourcat #IHAVESEENYOURCATA photo posted by Ramzan Kadyrov (@kadyrov_95) on May 23, 2016 at 11:41am PDTThis would all be funny, and well, it actually is, but Kadyrov is one of the most notorious human rights abusers in the world and if he has his way, he ll have a lot more influence in the coming months and years. At just 39, the anti-Muslim activist is looking for a position to be made for him in the Kremlin.Critics accuse the leader of kidnapping, torture, torching of homes and other human rights abuses. According to Human Rights Watch, Kadyrov shuts down all critics in Chechnya and now he s trying to shut one down in the United States. Kadyrov is also a strong admirer of Russian strong-man dictator, Vladimir Putin.He said it was no surprise that he liked to wear Putin T-shirts, and that  millions of people rejoice t-shirts with the image of the national leader .

It s unclear if Gianforte will be charged with the assault, but attacking a reporter literally a day before an election is unprecedented. The local sheriffs department was seen taking witness statements.It s not clear what caused the assault, but Ben Jacobs had recently caught Gianforte secretly investing $250,000 in several US-sanctioned Russian companies. It seems likely that the two things are linked.This assault happens less than 24 hours before polls open in Montana. The seat is meant to replace former GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke who Trump picked to run the Department of the Interior. Trump selected Zinke in part because Republicans believed that no Democrat could win the deep-red Montana seat   then Trump got into office, destroyed his credibility and that of the Republican Party and now the Democratic challenger Rob Quist has a real chance of winning.Naturally, the Trump family is linked to Gianforte. Add this to the numerous scandals and bad characters they ve attached themselves too. Trump s son, Don Jr. showed up at several Gianforte rally to help try to secure the seat for Republicans. The two have become close, spending quality time together during a recent a gopher hunting vacation. Seriously.And the audio just dropped.

"May 25, 2016","A federal lawsuit filed against officials at Dietrich High School, located in Dietrich, Idaho, claims that coaches and other staff at the school contributed to an environment of racist bullying, which culminated in the vicious rape of a Black teen by three white students.As KBOI reports here, 17-year-old Tanner Ward and 18-year-old John Howard, along with a third student who was not named, are facing felony sexual assault charges, after authorities say they carried out a vicious sexual assault on a disabled student.The three white students used a coat hanger to rape their Black classmate in the school locker room, last October.According to New York Daily News:A witness testified that Ward initiated the heartless attack and that Howard was the one who kicked the coat hanger five or six times while it was jammed inside the boy s rectum, causing painful injuries that required hospital treatment.The victim, who testified for the first time about the rape last month, told the court that he remembers the three students laughing throughout the brutal assault.According to the suit, coaches and other school officials created an atmosphere in which racist bullying of the mentally disabled teen was not only tolerated but encouraged.The suit alleges that football coaches urged other students, including Howard, to beat-up on the teen, claiming that it would  toughen him up. KBOI reports that the victim was made to wear boxing gloves, while Howard was encouraged to fight him bare-handed.During the incident, other students and coaches surrounded the Black teen, shouting racial slurs at him. The  nighttime fight,  as it was referred to by coaches and students, ended when the disabled teen was knocked unconscious by Howard.This is just one of many instances of racist bullying described in the suit, which states that the victim  was taunted and called racist names by other members of the team which names include  Kool-Aid   chicken eater   watermelon  and n r,  over the course of several months.According to New York Daily News:Howard, who is portrayed in court documents as the ringleader in the merciless harassment, is accused of forcing the black boy to sing a Ku Klux Klan song he learned in Texas, called  Notorious KKK.  Howard also encouraged other football players to join in on the vicious bullying, the suit alleges.The suit, which seeks $10 million in damages, alleges that coaches and school officials knew what was happening, but failed in their duty to protect the disabled student.As KTVB reports in the video below, since filing the suit the victim s family has experienced harassment from some local residents. The school was placed on lockdown on Wednesday, after news of the story broke nationally.Here s more on the story from KTVB.Image credit: video screen capture KTVB", White Students Rape Black Teen With Coat Hanger After Months Of Racist Taunting (VIDEO)
"May 25, 2017","Trump is not the only U.S. leader in Europe right now. Former President Obama is also there, and he met with German chancellor Angela Merkel before the big NATO summit. Merkel is up for re-election, and Obama gave her a strong endorsement, which made her Christian Democratic base happy. Unlike Trump, Obama remains very popular in Germany.And Politico, in covering this particular story, decided to throw a bit of shade in Trump s direction over Obama s meeting. Their headline for the story reads:  Merkel meets popular US president before seeing Trump. That was the caption on their tweet of the story as well:Merkel meets popular U.S. president   before seeing @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/eQ6endyszF via @POLITICOEurope pic.twitter.com/s55txBKAQn  POLITICO (@politico) May 25, 2017Seriously, Politico did that. And it s hilarious in light of the fact that Merkel and Obama continue to have a very strong relationship, while she really just can t stand Donald Trump. Obama received a warm welcome, and the two of them discussed the lessons of the Berlin Wall while in front of tens of thousands of cheering Germans at the 250-year old Brandenburg Gate. Trump, however, was greeted curtly and coolly in Brussels barely two hours later.Against the backdrop of the Brandenburg Gate, which survived WWII despite much of the rest of Berlin being destroyed, Obama himself threw a little shade at Trump over his isolationist,  America First  ideas: In this new world we live in, we can t isolate ourselves. We can t hide behind a wall. He also took aim at Trump for being a narcissistic prick: If I become so convinced that  I m always right,  the logical conclusion of that often ends up being great cruelty and great violence. In Brussels, Trump yelled at our allies again, claiming they aren t paying their fair share of defense expenses for NATO. Trump believes that our NATO allies are shoving their expenses off on us, and doesn t understand the treaty well enough to know that s not how it works.So Politico decided to demonstrate what Germany or at least Angela Merkel thinks about Obama versus what she thinks about Trump. Trump is ridiculous, and it s clear that at least some of our allies wish we still had Obama in office.Featured image by Stefan Rousseau Pool via Getty Images", Politico Just Threw MAJOR Shade At Trump Over Merkel’s Meeting With Obama Ahead of NATO Summit
"May 26, 2015"," Drawing Muhammad is not illegal under American law, but only under Islamic law. Violence that arises over the cartoons is solely the responsibility of the Islamic jihadists who perpetrate it. Because freedom of speech is under violent assault, the human rights advocacy group the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) has announced a new ad campaign to defend freedom of speech and stand up to violent intimidation kicking off in the nation s capital.I said in a statement:  Because the media and the cultural and political elites continue to self-enforce the Sharia without the consent of the American people by refusing to show any depictions of Muhammad or showing what it was in Texas that had jihadists opening fire, we are running an ad featuring the winning cartoon by former Muslim Bosch Fawstin from our Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas. Let the American people see what the cowardly press is censoring in accordance with the blasphemy laws under the sharia (Islamic law).The ad campaign has been submitted to the Washington, D.C. MTA to run on buses and train dioramas in the Foggy Bottom, Capitol South, Bethesda, L Enfant Plaza, and Shady Grove stations. Drawing Muhammad is not illegal under American law, but only under Islamic law. Violence that arises over the cartoons is solely the responsibility of the Islamic jihadists who perpetrate it. Either America will stand now against attempts to suppress the freedom of speech by violence, or will submit and give the violent the signal that we can be silenced by threats and murder. We cannot submit to the assassin s veto. It was the jihadis, not I, who made the cartoons a flash point. If we surrender on that point and stop drawing Muhammad, we ve established a precedent of surrendering to violent Sharia enforcement, and once established, we will be made to reinforce it again and again. Islamist government is a unique threat to free speech and libertyFreedom of speech is the foundation of a free society. Without it, a tyrant can wreak havoc unopposed, while his opponents are silenced.Putting up with being offended is essential in a pluralistic society in which people differ on basic truths. If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others.I added:  There is nothing about this cartoon that incites violence. It is within the established American tradition of satire. If America surrenders on this point, the freedom of speech is a relic of history. AFDI Vice President Robert Spencer stated:  Many people on both the Left and the Right are saying that we should do nothing to provoke Islamic fundamentalism. The immediate answer would seem to be that we should do nothing to provoke violent jihadis, that the prudent thing to do would be to avoid doing things that anger them. But if we did that, they would not they stop coming at us. Last September, an Islamic State spokesman boasted:  We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted. This is His promise to us; He is glorified and He does not fail in His promise. If we do not reach that time, then our children and grandchildren will reach it, and they will sell your sons as slaves at the slave market. In light of that, what is the point of asking whether or not we should provoke them? They re already provoked,  he continued.  A more useful question now is whether it is really productive and helpful to signal to them that we will acquiesce to their threats of violence and change our behavior accordingly, or whether we will instead signal to them that their violent threats are not going to frighten us into submission. The ads have been submitted to run on buses in Washington, D.C.AFDI stands for:The freedom of speech   as opposed to Islamic prohibitions of  blasphemy  and  slander,  which are used effectively to quash honest discussion of jihad and Islamic supremacism; The freedom of conscience   as opposed to the Islamic death penalty for apostasy; The equality of rights of all people before the law   as opposed to Sharia s institutionalized discrimination against women and non-Muslims.

"May 26, 2016","What s the most anti-American thing someone can do besides vote for Donald Trump in November? Apparently, right-wing freak Ted Nugent has the answer to that question, and it s something every American should hear. Speaking with conservative radio host Joe Pags, he tells us: There is nothing more anti-American than the freaks that hate me, and when MoveOn.org, Media Matters, Southern Poverty Law Center, Rachel Maddow and MSNBC lie and spew their hate towards me, it s because I stand with the best families in America. The man certainly thinks a lot of himself, doesn t he? One might have thought there was no more room in this country for egos, what with Donald Trump s ego growing miles by the minute after officially locking up the GOP nomination, but one would be wrong. It takes a lot of ego and chutzpah for Ted Nugent to say that the most anti-American thing imaginable is hating him.He says that the NRA is not a gun lobby during this interview, too. What is it, then? Nugent says it s  mom-and-pop family America, and is standing up for the most fundamental instinct and God-given individual right  that self-defense (i.e. owning guns) is good. Har de har har. Only Nugent can fit this much nonsense into one interview.He also rages against Hillary Clinton and Bernie  Mao Tse Tung  Sanders about wanting to push gun owners down, and he talks about how he s right all the time if so many people have to hate on him so much. Listen to him toss a major word salad below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/266047509  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Let s look at Nugent for a moment. He s incredibly ammosexual   in fact, he was just re-elected as a board member of the NRA, despite the fact that many of the NRA s members aren t nearly as crazy as Nugent is. Nugent thinks that anybody who even criticizes the NRA just wants to help criminals.Before President Obama was elected, he said that he would either be dead or imprisoned within two weeks of winning the election. That hasn t happened yet, but the Secret Service took it as a threat against Obama and investigated it. He also referred to a lawmaker of mixed-race heritage as a  subhuman mongrel. We must acknowledge, however, that Ted Nugent is a patriot among patriots   a word that s been usurped and twisted by the far right to only apply to white supremacists who love guns, fetuses and the Bible. They hate the poor, along with starving children and anyone who thinks helping others is a good thing. He s a true patriot, except for that time he dodged the Vietnam draft by pooping in his pants every day. Or so he said.But to say that the most anti-American thing out there is to hate Ted Nugent is over the top, even for him.

"May 26, 2017","In a stunning example of just how morally bankrupt right-wing media has become in the Age of Trump, Breitbart   the conservative website often described as Trump s de facto propaganda wing   wrote a lavish piece praising Melania Trump for her  high fashion  outfits while accompanying her husband on his first overseas trip.Who cares, right? Why would anyone have a problem with what the first lady is wearing on a trip?Well, Breitbart, the very same website, seems to   albeit only when it s the African-American wife of America s first African-American president. Here s the sneering way they covered Michelle Obama s decision to wear a $3,200 dress on the former president s visit with the pope.Politico reports that First Lady Michelle Obama, looking lovely and classy, greeted Pope Francis Tuesday while wearing a $2,290 dress. While the Obamas are not Catholics, this is still a finger-in-the-eye to a White House guest who frequently speaks out   to wild Democrat applause   about the evils of excessive capitalism.And adding to the absurd critique:According to WorldVision, you can feed a child for just $35  a month. Michelle Obama s dress would feed over 80 children for that month. This choice obviously is contrary to the values of Pope Francis. But the Obamas  religious values come from elsewhere, a divisive and disturbing place, not a charitable or unifying one.Almost beyond parody.Flash forward to this weekend. Melania was treated to a photo spread, with Brietbart praising her outfits, including an expensive custom-made creation from fashion designer Dolce & Gabbana.In a visit to meet Pope Francis, Melania worked with Dolce & Gabbana, again, on a stunning custom-made, black coat-dress that showed off a beautiful round collar, framing the First Lady s face. The look was paired with a black lace Mantilla and black Manolo Blahnik stilettos, sticking to the Vatican dress code.The next day, Melania would don a dress that cost $51,000. Conservatives didn t bat an eye.Let s crunch those numbers through Breitbart s bullshit calculator:According to WorldVision, you can feed a child for just $35 a month. Melania Trump s dress would feed over 1400 children for a month. But then the Trump s religious values come from elsewhere, a divisive and disturbing place, not a charitable one. (This comparison, however tongue-in-cheek, is actually unfair in more ways than one, the Obamas actually do have a history of charitable giving. Trump is famous for not donating to charity. A truly  divisive and disturbing  worldview, if there ever was one.)As the above passages exemplify, Breitbart loved to apply ridiculous, nonsense standards to the Obamas that they would never dream of holding the Trump family up to. The website once run by anti-Semite Steve Bannon and which has a section devoted to  black crime  has some pretty obvious, bigoted reasons for hating the Obamas.

"May 27, 2016","This is sad and infuriating.In February, former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich suffered the loss of his father.Despite his dad s death, an insurance agent called to inform Reich that his dad is behind on his car insurance payments.Now, one would think that being informed of the death would not only draw condolences, but also an end to the business at hand considering deceased people can t drive, nor can they pay insurance from the grave.But this auto insurance agent couldn t get the reality of the situation through his thick skull. He proceeded to try and bully Reich into paying hundreds of dollars and even informed Reich that not paying would affect his father s credit rating.Reich described the phone call on Facebook. I just got a call from my father s auto insurer, telling me he s behind on his payment. I explained he died in February. He still needs to pay for the last two months,  said the man from the insurance company. But he can t pay. He s deceased,  I said. He owes $348.62, for the period April 24 to June 24,  he said. But he didn t drive then. He died in February. No one has driven his car since he died. Well, someone has to pay or his insurance will be cancelled, and it will hurt his credit rating. I m sure he d be okay if it s cancelled,  I said.  And I don t think he cares about his credit rating. Are you infuriated yet?Clearly, this insurance agent must be a truly heartless person. He even became snippy with Reich upon hearing that Reich s father won t care about his credit rating and the conversation continued to go in circles as the insurance agent tried another intimidation tactic and didn t seem to get that his client was dead and no longer needed car insurance. Are you trying to be smart with me?  asked the man from the insurance company. No, I m just trying to tell you that my father is deceased and he doesn t need car insurance. Have you cancelled his car registration? No, I haven t got around to that. Well, you should. If he s deceased, he shouldn t have a registration. I understand. Nobody s supposed to have a registration if they re not paying their auto insurance.   Right. So, are you going to pay the insurance that s due? I wasn t planning to. Then it s an illegal car. But it won t be on the road. Still illegal. Sorry. That could be a problem for him. He s no longer with us. I know. You made that clear. I m referring to his estate. I don t see how. Well, let s say the state of Florida imposes a penalty for having a car registered in his name but no insurance. And let s say that penalty holds up any legal proceedings in resolving  The insurance agent STILL tried to get Reich to pay the insurance, even going so far as to talk about a hypothetical situation in order to force Reich to reach into his pocket and pay for something that was no longer necessary.Frustrated and growing tired of the phone call, Reich asked the insurance vampire who he is supporting for president. And the answer explains everything. May I ask you a personal question? Personal? Who do you support for President? For President? I don t mean to pry. [chuckling]  Oh, no problem,  he said. You have a favorite candidate?  I asked. As a matter of fact, I do,  he said. And who is it? That Trump fella. Really? Yeah, Trump. Good man. No bullshit. Here s the post via Facebook.Personally, I would have hung up the phone rather than keep repeating myself to the same asshole, but there you have it, folks. An ignorant insurance agent who tries to bully money out of people even if they are dead. That sounds exactly like the kind of person who would support Donald Trump.Featured image via Comunicas"," Insurance Agent Calls Robert Reich To Bully Him For Money, Guess Who He Supports For President"

"May 28, 2015","Nothing like riding on your sister s coattails and making bucketloads of cash just because you re a mooch and a grifter like they are. The Clinton Foundation was nothing but a slush fund for these scumbags Sitting in a courtroom three years ago, after skipping out on a sizable legal bill, Hillary Rodham Clinton s youngest brother struck a reassuring tone: Don t worry, the money is coming. I deal through the Clinton Foundation,  Tony Rodham said, according to court transcripts uncovered by the New York Times. He gave his word that Hillary and Bill were setting him up with Haitian-government permits to build a $22 million housing development in the earthquake-stricken country. I hound my brother-in-law, because it s his fund that we re going to get our money from,  Rodham explained, promising a $1 million check once the Haitian-government paved the way, enough both to cover the outstanding legal fees and take his family to Disney World.The construction deal fell through, but Rodham managed to settle his debt. And the next year, he got another crack at making money in Haiti s heavily-regulated economy when he joined the advisory board of a company, VCS Mining, which was developing a gold mine on the island. He d met the company s CEO at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative.  I go to see old friends [at the meetings,]  Rodham told the Washington Post,  but you never know what can happen. From the moment the Clintons walked through the White House doors in January of 1993, Rodham has proven remarkably adept at harnessing their political horsepower for his personal gain. His schemes don t always pan out, and they have caused numerous headaches for Hillary and Bill. But Rodham s fortunes have always been tied to theirs, his bank account waxing and waning in time with the Clintons  political prospects. He may lack their sophistication, but to many observers, Tony is the unvarnished embodiment of the Clintons  decades-long dance with crony capitalism.Rodham sits atop of a pile of money acquired through a vast tangle of enterprises just a little less secret and complex than those of his sister and brother-in-law.  There s really no better definition of what this is,  says David Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United and a longtime Clinton foe.  This is a person who is not directly the principal, but he s the brother   or, in the 1990s, the brother-in-law   of the president, using these open doors of family to shake people down.

"May 28, 2016","Donald Trump has been trying to suppress internal documents from his controversial Trump University business, but a judge has just ruled that they must be released into the public domain.The Friday ruling, in which Judge Gonzalo Curiel cited heightened public interest in presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, was issued in response to a request by The Washington Post. The ruling was a setback for Trump, whose attorneys argued that the documents contained trade secrets.Curiel s order came the same day that Trump railed against the judge at a boisterous San Diego rally for his handling of the case, in which students have alleged they were misled and defrauded. The trial is set for November.The documents reportedly contain information on how Trump University advised its employees on how to squeeze the most money from students who had signed up for information on building their own real estate business. Trump University has been criticized by former students and investigators like the Attorney general for New York for trying to make money from people desperate to be entrepreneurs, when in fact much of the material they received was worthless.Trump University students have previously said they were constantly upsold new material, while rarely making the kind of money that was promised in ads featuring Trump and his personal branding.On Friday, Trump included an attack on the judge in the Trump University case in his remarks at a campaign rally. He described the judge as a  Mexican,  when in reality he is a U.S. citizen.Trump University is among the many failed businesses Trump has been involved in over the years. Other companies that failed include Trump Steaks, Trump Air, and Trump Magazine. Trump s business and casinos have filed for bankruptcy several times.

"May 28, 2017","Donald Trump keeps digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole where Russia is concerned. His entire term has been plagued by a steady drip of leaks regarding his shady Russian ties. The latest revelation to become front page news is that his son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, was trying to establish a secret line of communication between Trump and the Kremlin.Not surprisingly, administration officials are pushing for Kushner to step aside and take a leave of absence amid his current Russian scandal. According to ABC News, members of Trump s inner circle  are saying it might be time for Jared Kushner to take a leave of absence from the White House. Last week, it was announced that Kushner had come under intense scrutiny by the FBI because of his suspicious contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, as well as a Russian banking executive. Then the Washington Post reported on Friday that Kushner had been attempting to set up a  back channel  of communication between Trump and Moscow.To call this news a bombshell (a term that has become a cliche with Trump in the White House) would be an understatement. Former intelligence officials, with decades of experience, say they had never seen anything like this before and described the news as off the map,   explosive,  and  extremely dangerous. Both Trump s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn were forced to resign when news broke of their Russian ties.

"May 29, 2015","I wonder how many government funded trucks will be following Mooch s kids this summer? Oh, that s right she s a  good  mom. There s no need for government intervention Government-sponsored food trucks will be stalking students this summer with the goal of giving out thousands of  healthy  free lunches officials don t trust parents to provide.Officials at St. Paul public schools recently announced they re working with the local food bank Second Harvest to dispatch a mobile food truck to expand locations offering students free lunches during the summer. Last year the district supplied 71 locations, and the truck will help to add another 10 to 15 in 2015, KSTP reports.The district s director of nutrition services, Stacy Koppen, said the truck will drive around to different locations between 10:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. to help feed the city s needy youngsters. The truck will track down students at  spots like suggested basketball courts or fields where kids like to play,  according to the news site.The very expensive-looking specially rigged step van features a billboard with grinning teens alongside the message  Kids and teens: Get your free meals here.  The district apparently didn t offer the details on how the new program is financed, or how much the truck cost, and the news station didn t bother to ask. School officials said the truck will be manned by volunteers.Koppen said the district serves 29,000 lunches a day during the school year, but only 6,000 a day during the summer, so officials reasoned a truck is necessary to make sure students aren t starving. Time and again, we such a steep decline that we wonder,  Where are these children going? Are they getting the healthy, nutritious food they need for their health and academic success?  Koppen told KTSP. We want to make sure that when children return to school for the next school year, that they are at the optimal health status and that they are ready to learn,  she said, adding that the free food is available to all, not just low income kids.Minneapolis Public Schools have used food trucks to give away lunches since at least 2013. The Hopkins district in Minnesota, as well as districts in Colorado, New York, Massachusetts, Indiana, California, Tennessee, and other states have also launched trucks to take free food to students during the summer.In New York City, organizations can also apply to have school food trucks deliver meals to students on site upon request.Most, if not all, of the school food trucks seem to be funded at least in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as part of the federal free and reduced-price school lunch program. Each summer, the United States Department of Agriculture reimburses school districts for all meals prepared and served at no cost to any child under the age of 18,  the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel reports.The news site explained that School District 51 expanded its free summer lunch program to dispatch a food truck to patrol local neighborhoods and seek out students. The USDA will pay for food and staff labor but not for the purchase of a food truck or the cost of running it,  according to the Daily Sentinel.In District 51, the cost of the truck and expenses are covered by a $50,000 grant from the Western Colorado Community Foundation.Via: EAG News",WHY TAXPAYER FUNDED FOOD TRUCKS PLAN TO STALK KIDS THIS SUMMER
"May 29, 2016","A group of about 1,000 Christians planned to attend next week s Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., so they could hand out literature and about $25,000 in Subway gift cards. The purpose was to show the atheists that would be there some so-called  Christian love.  However, the D.C. police have put a stop to that, saying they would have to get a separate permit, and stay on the other side of the National Mall, because such a gathering constitutes a protest.Organizer Ray Comfort told Christian NewsWire the following: In what is so often a cruel world, we tried to show a little kindness and it didn t work. So it now looks like we will be eating Subway sandwiches for the next 40 years. Oh, no. What to do, what to do? Comfort will still be allowed to film the event, because his film crew is too small to need a permit. Since the Reason Rally is free and open to the public, Comfort is now encouraging Christians to go as individuals, and not as a group, so they can still proselytize to the atheists there. That s their M.O.   force their religion down the throats of anyone who doesn t believe in any way possible.While Comfort can understand the perspective of the police they re trying to maintain peace there s a solid chance that there will be Christians there who don t get it at all, and only see their so-called  mission from God,  to convert these heathens. For instance, Eric Hovind, writing on Creation Today, said: On June 4, 2016 we will be gathering in Washington, D.C. to share the love of Christ with a group of people who practice the religion of Selfianity. That s right, they self identify as  Atheists  in order to become worshipers of themselves. Oh, please. Hovind is one of those that thinks atheists (and other non-Christians) are the root of what s wrong with the world. He won t be the only one there to think that way, either.Hovind calls his blog post  REASON hits the Reason Rally 2016,  in a lame attempt to demonstrate that Christianity is the only reason there is. He s one of those that will probably end up hounding the atheists that attend.There is one good thing to come out of this. Some readers of The Friendly Atheist were able to convince Ray Comfort to give those Subway gift cards to the homeless. That there is true Christian love   helping the downtrodden. They need to spend more time doing that, and less time trying to convert people to their religion and taking over the country.Featured image by Brambmanu.

"May 3, 2016","Donald Trump has cleared the Republican presidential field of all the credible (and not so credible) challengers, and is now the presumptive nominee for the same party that produced Teddy Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, and Ronald Reagan. It is amazing.But in picking Trump as their nominee, the Republican Party has chosen a candidate with a binder full of negatives, so many negatives in fact that it is highly unlikely he can overcome enough of them to win the presidency.Here are 5 of the reasons.70 percent of women in a recent Gallup poll have a negative view of Donald Trump. That s because Trump has a long record   including in this campaign   of attacking women. He s called them pigs, talked about their bathroom habits, complained about their periods, and on and on.Women are the majority of American voters, and Republicans have lost that demographic for years. Even when they have won the presidency, they ve lost with women.And while it isn t all she is, Hillary Clinton will obviously be the first major party nominee to be a woman. So far, Trump has not reacted well to this, accusing her of playing  the woman card,  with her candidacy, a sexist comment that echoed with millions of working women voters. The Clinton campaign was able to raise over $2 million just by highlighting Trump s comment and giving donors a  woman card  to mark the moment.Mitt Romney was pilloried over his comment that he had  binders full  of women, and he never was half as sexist as Trump has been on an average day.Donald Trump is most unpopular candidate for a major political party basically since polling was invented. Trump has an average of 60.6 percent disapproval!That is unheard of going into the party conventions, where candidates are usually a blank canvas before attack ads start to fly in the fall. But Trump is one of the most well-known people in America, and what America has seen   it doesn t like.President Obama nearly coasted to national electoral victories in back to back elections with a diverse, young, electorate. And while Hillary Clinton has had trouble connecting with younger voters in the Democratic primary, Donald Trump is the best positioned candidate to motivate the Obama coalition against him.He polls poorly with women, minorities, and in a recent poll younger voters indicated that despite their reservations about Clinton, they have near to no interest in Trump.At this point in the 2012 election, President Obama was 3.4 percent ahead of Mitt Romney in head-to-head national matchups. By comparison, Clinton leads Trump by an average of 6.2 percent, and that includes a poll from conservative pollster Rasmussen who got the 2012 election completely wrong.Most other recent polls show Clinton with leads of +11%, +7% and +11%.The New York Times  Nate Cohn explains why this is unlikely to change much:There have been 10-point shifts over the general election season before, even if it s uncommon. But there isn t much of a precedent for huge swings in races with candidates as well known as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. A majority of Americans may not like her, but they say they re scared of him. To have a chance, he ll need to change that.Unlike President George W. Bush in 2008, President Obama is unlikely to be a drag on the ticket. In addition to the unusual image of a sitting president campaigning for his party s nominee (Reagan was too ill to do it in 1988, the Gore campaign pushed Clinton away in 2000, and McCain did his best to hide from Bush in 2008), President Obama s approval ratings have inched back up over the last year, often above or near 50 percent.Additionally, the unemployment rate is at 5 percent, after hitting almost 10 percent in the Bush economy, and gas prices have come way down. Polls now show Americans feel good about the economy, after Obama s policies have gotten the country out of the Great Recession (without Republican help).That s good for the party in power, which means it s good for Hillary Clinton, and bad for Donald Trump.Featured image via Flickr", 5 Reasons The Republicans Just Nominated The Worst Possible Candidate: Trump

Obama s $400,000 Wall Street speaking fee will undermine everything he believes in,  Vox s Matt Yglesias proclaimed. Obama and Bill Clinton biographer David Maraniss said the 44th president  does not need the money and should not accept it.  Others noted the unseemliness of the fee at a time of income inequality and seemingly rampant populism, especially since Barack and Michelle Obama have already struck insanely lucrative book deals.Even Elizabeth Warren was  troubled  by Obama s speaking fees. Bernie Sanders called the fees  distasteful. Well, everyone can relax now.

"May 30, 2016","Maybe being a racist bigot isn t good for business after all. As Donald Trump ascends to power within the Republican ranks, his day job of being a hotel mogul is taking a serious hit. As the stupidity spews from his mouth on a daily basis, Hipmunk, a Priceonomics customer and travel search engine, shows that bookings for Trump s hotels have plummeted by 60 percent.The methodology used was an in depth analysis of the total US Trump Hotel property bookings made in the first quarter of both 2015 and 2016.In other words, Trump is losing more than half his business.What s even more shocking is Hipmunk has hotel bookings, on average, on the rise while Trump s are among the only going against the grain. Before running for President of the United States, Trump s hotels saw a 1.7 percent increase annually.According to Priceonomics:In New York City and Vegas, Trump Hotels  share of each city s total hotel bookings dropped more than 70 percent. Even in Atlantic City, where Trump Hotels claim the highest percentage of a city s total hotel bookings, Trump Hotels took a major hit year-over-year. The Trump Taj Mahal s share of bookings is down 17% in the first quarter of this year.One of the only Trump hotels that has seen an increase in attendance is the International Hotel Waikiki Beach Walk, which has seen a jump of 4 percent.The biggest decline comes from Trump s Soho New York, which shows a staggering 74 percent net loss in bookings.While Trump lambasts who he calls the  losers  and  haters,  the American people are saying no thanks to his shady and most likely illegal hotel business. It looks like the only  loser  is the Trump Organization. If this trend continues, Trump may have to file for a bankruptcy for the fifth time. While Republicans hope and prey Target goes under, maybe they should pay attention to their frontrunner s business instead.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images", Bookings For Trump’s Hotels Plummet By 60 percent
"May 30, 2017","To Donald Trump, his popularity is everything, which may be why his favorite mode of communication is Twitter. Twitter s model of having people follow other Twitter accounts, rather than having a mutual  friendship  gives celebrities and notables opportunities to collect thousands or even millions of followers.Trump s personal account has about 31 million followers, which is nothing to sneeze at. Then again Katy Perry has nearly 100 million and Barack Obama nearly 90 million. You have to know that drives Trump absolutely crazy.Trump has been doing some housecleaning recently by blocking some of his more contentious followers (I know several who were blocked just last week). Still, his Twitter following dramatically increased on Tuesday, and there s something very weird about many of those followers. They don t have pictures and they ve never tweeted.Trump s Twitter acc has suddenly gained 3 mil followers and has been blocking lots of people. New followers look like this  pic.twitter.com/uzYkeNsjUC  John Niven (@NivenJ1) May 30, 2017John Niven wasn t cherry picking. If you click on Trump s recent followers, more of them have no pictures and no tweets than those who are active Twitter users. They re an oddly international (given Trump s nationalism) group of followers as well.These followers are likely bots. They aren t people at all. According to Twitter Audit, only 51 percent of Trump s followers are real. Nearly half are fake, and that s not just the new ones.The number of fake accounts has gotten a lot worse since Trump took office.This isn t the first time someone has pointed out that a good portion of Trump s Twitter following is fake, but what s interesting is that its fakeness seems to be increasing. In January, journalist Yashar Ali ran an audit on Trump s Twitter account and found that 68 percent of his then-20 million followers were real. Now he s at 30 million followers, but only 51 percent are real, which means of 10 million followers Trump has gained since January, about 8.3 million are fake. Compare that to Barack Obama. 79 percent are real.In April 2016, when Trump was beginning to gain traction as a serious candidate to at least win the Republican presidential nomination, the former reality TV star had a mere 7.58 million followers, only 8 percent of which were fake, according to FiveThirtyEight. It s not surprising that as Trump s global profile has skyrocketed in the past 13 months, so too have the number of bots attached to his Twitter account but it s astonishing how much the percentage of his followers that are fake has risen.Source: NewsweekWhile fake followers are a pretty serious problem on Facebook, and not one that the user can always control, it is easy to buy Twitter followers and it s a big problem.Automated adding to lists or collections: You may not add Twitter users to lists or add Tweets to collections in a bulk or indiscriminate manner. Adding a large number of unrelated users to lists is a violation of the Twitter Rules.If Trump did pay for the followers (and perhaps even if he didn t), he s violating Twitter s rules and his account should be banned.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.", There’s Something Very Weird About Nearly Half Of Trump’s Twitter Followers
"May 31, 2015","With 25% of Mexico now living in America Americans should be demanding our  President  tell us why he allowed these illegal aliens to cross our southern border and who will pay for their health care and education? Americans pride ourselves on being people who have a government. But these days, it more often seems as if we ve got a government that has people.And that government is even selecting who its people will be, having within a generation essentially imported a state s worth of new people through immigration.Since 1970, the number of  Hispanics of Mexican origin  in the U.S. has jumped from fewer than 1 million to more than 33 million. If all these Mexicans were a state, it would be the second largest in population in the country, trailing only California.Did you vote to approve that immigration policy? Did anyone? In fact, the federal government allowed it to happen without any voter input. That s by design.In recent years, Congress has attempted to draft legislation to deal with illegal immigration. And while the controversial  Gang of Eight  bill passed the Senate in 2013, it died in the House after one of its authors withdrew his support. Immigration is a difficult topic, one that will require difficult discussions.Instead, the Obama White House would prefer to short-circuit the political discussions. America cannot wait forever for them to act. That s why today I am beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress,  President Obama warned last summer. After the November elections, he acted to grant amnesty to millions of illegals.In February, a federal judge put a hold on that policy while he determined its legality. The administration admits it went right on ahead, issuing 2,000 more waivers. Now, an appeals court has upheld the stay. But the White House says it will press ahead. [T]he administration s enforcement priorities, including our focus on deporting felons and not families, and many other executive actions on immigration continue to move forward,  White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters this week.  It would be a shame if an issue so critical like this became mired in a political dispute. But Schultz has it exactly backward. If our representative system of government means anything, it should mean that the people have a say in the big issues facing our country.It s precisely because the issue is so important that it deserves to be a subject of political disputes. It s through the political process in the presidential and congressional elections of 2016 that voters can finally have a say in the nation s immigration policy. We ve already waited far too long.Via: Breitbart News ",DEATH OF A NATION BY EXECUTIVE ORDER: Who Voted To Bring 33 MILLION Immigrants To America?

Schneiderman is the highest profile government official looking into Trump s shady business dealings at Trump University. Customers claim that after they signed up for the opportunity, they were pressured to spend ever-increasing amounts of money with little knowledge of the real estate business to show for it.In an interview with ABC, the attorney general explained that he s not going to back off. We re ready to go,  Schneiderman, a Democrat, told ABC News today.  We sued him long before anyone thought he might run for President. This is not a political case, it s just a straight-up fraud case. Like the judge also looking into the case, Scneiderman has come in for attack by Trump, who has used his high profile to impugn the prosecutor s motives. But that hasn t dissuaded the prosecutor.Schneiderman told ABC News he is not worrying about the confluence of the campaign and his case. The documents, he said only served to offer further proof that the operation was aimed less at teaching students the skills needed to buy and sell real state, and more about making money for Trump. It was clearly a way to separate people who were desperate to make money in hard economic times from their own cash and to get it into the pocket of Mr. Trump and his cronies,  Schneiderman said.The secret Trump University documents have revealed that workers at the operation were given a step-by-step manual on how to convince prospective  students  to give the company access to their money and also explained how to prey on their emotions in pursuit of profits.

"May 31, 2017","The men investigating the working conditions at the factory that makes, among other products, Ivanka Trump s shoe line, have either been arrested or have gone missing.One of the three men has been arrested while the other two have gone missing. While there is currently no evidence to point the finger at Donald Trump, or even his buddy Vladimir Putin, this does bode badly for BLOTUS in other ways.First, the facts of the story, from CBS News:Hua Haifeng was accused of illegal surveillance, according to his wife, Deng Guilian, who said the police called her Tuesday afternoon. Deng said the caller told her she didn t need to know the details, only that she would not be able to see, speak with or receive money from her husband, the family s breadwinner.China Labor Watch Executive Director Li Qiang said he lost contact with Hua Haifeng and the other two men, Li Zhao and Su Heng, over the weekend. By Tuesday, after dozens of unanswered calls, he had concluded:  They must be held either by the factory or the police to be unreachable.  Officials at the Public Security Bureau in Ganzhou would not confirm to CBS News if Hua was detained, but his wife was made aware of the charge Tuesday afternoon.China Labor Watch is an American human rights organization that tracks workplace abuses in China. They were planning on publishing a report about the factory s low wages, excessive overtime and alleged misuse of interns, next month. They have been investigating Chinese factories for 17 years, and they say that it s never been more of a political hotbed than it is now. This is the first time that their investigators have gone missing or have been detained.While this does sound like some Putinesque tactics, it s pretty much indicative of any strong arm dictator. The Chinese ruling Communist Party is feeling especially vulnerable right now and they re cracking down on all sorts of threats to the party.We may never know whether these men were targeted because it s the factory that makes Ivanka Trump s shoes, but we do know that Trump has an affinity for dictators and has even expressed that he had  great chemistry  with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It also raises a lot of questions as to why this particular factory, one that manufactures shoes for the daughter of the American President, was targeted.We also know that thanks to China, Trump is about to get a lot richer. In February, the Chinese government approved 38 trademarks that Trump had been seeking for almost a year. They had been held up thanks to Once he became president, the process seemed to move rather quickly. Trump has also softened his stance toward China from what it was on the campaign trail. While still a candidate, Trump accused China of manipulating currency.There are four possibilities here: The Chinese are solely behind it, the Russians are behind it, or Trump is behind it, which is pretty much the same as the Russians being behind it, or it was a collaboration. When you follow the money, there are two clear losers when the violations are reported. While no one is accusing Trump of orchestrating this (is he smart enough, anyway?), he, along with the Chinese government both benefit from this report not being released. For both Trumps, it might just be a happy coincidence.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images.", People Investigating Ivanka Trump’s Chinese Factory Have Been Arrested Or Gone Missing

"May 4, 2017","House Republicans managed to pass their healthcare bill on Thursday, just barely, and it is truly a despicable piece of legislation. The right-wing nutjobs who have taken over the Republican party, AKA the Freedom Caucus, refused to vote in favor of the bill as long as Obamacare s protections for pre-existing conditions remained intact. So, the GOP said the hell with it and gutted protections for the sick in order to gain their votes.Think it can t get any worse? WRONG. As if taking health care from 24 million people and removing protections for pre-existing conditions isn t bad enough, what qualifies as a pre-existing condition is even worse.Among possible pre-existing conditions that could result in outrageous premiums are rape and sexual assault. Seriously. Rape.NYMag reports:The new MacArthur-Meadows Amendment will allow states to discriminate based on medical history, reportedly without addressing the subsequent high cost of health care for millions of Americans.In addition to rape, postpartum depression, cesarean sections, and surviving domestic violence are all considered preexisting conditions. Companies can also deny coverage for gynecological services and mammograms.The amendment also says that Nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to discriminate in rates for health insurance coverage by gender.  But, ummm, did you look at what qualifies as a pre-existing condition? Insurance companies don t have to cover  gynecological services and mammograms  that screen for cancer? How many men are gonna need a c-section? How many men have postpartum depression? How many men need a pap smear to check for cervical cancer? Seems pretty damn obvious that being a woman is a pre-existing condition itself.Paul Ryan and Donald Trump have tried to claim that pre-existing conditions are covered, but that isn t exactly the truth. The MacArthur-Meadows amendment  would allow states to opt out of federal regulations and allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums for people who have pre-existing conditions. Since this was the law of the land before the Affordable Care Act, we know what happens when you give insurance companies this option: they set premiums so high that sick people are priced out of insurance coverage altogether.So now, besides the shame, fear, and trauma that have traditionally kept women from seeking medical care after they are sexually assaulted, rape victims now get to worry that they will lose their health insurance if they get help.

"May 5, 2015","We re not sure which of Judge Mary Murguia s qualifications for becoming a U.S. Supreme Court Justice would be more attractive to Obama. Could it be the fact that she, like Barack Obama can claim she is responsible for dismissing charges against a terrorist?  Perhaps her it s her sister s connection as a leader of La Raza, a government funded, radical activist group fighting to defend amnesty in America. Knowing Barry, it s likely both.The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge who previously dismissed terror charges against one of the Garland, Texas shooters has a connection to the controversial activist group, National Council of La Raza.Judge Mary Murguia, appointed by President Clinton and considered a potential nominee to the Supreme Court by President Obama, was the judge who dismissed government charges against Elton Simpson for suspected terrorism in 2011. On Sunday, Simpson attacked a free speech event in Garland, Texas depicting the Prophet Muhammad in cartoons.Daniel Greenfield cites evidence from the 2011 case:The FBI knew that Elton Simpson, one of the Garland Jihadists, was a threat and had attempted to lock him up after amassing evidence that he intended to go to Somalia as a terrorist. They had him on tape stating  that Allah loves an individual who is  out there fighting [non-Muslims]  and  If you get shot, or you get killed, it s [heaven] straight away.  Mr. Simpson then said  [Heaven] that s what we here for so why not take that route? Judge Murguia held then that the government was unable to prove Simpson mentioned violent jihad in his reasoning for traveling to Somalia.  That phrase is one made up by the Government, likely because it is aware that jihad in the Muslim religion does not necessarily imply violence,  she said, noted Greenfield.However, the LA Times previously noted that Judge Murguria s twin sister Janet Murguia leads a controversial group known as National Council of La Raza, which has been criticized as a racist hate group. It is the nation s largest Latino civil rights activist organization. La Raza is closely linked to the Obama Administration s amnesty efforts.Human Events, a conservative blog, previously reported that the mainstream media views La Raza  no more than a Hispanic Rotary Club.  But La Raza collected roughly $15.2 million in federal grants in 2005. Human Events also reported that undisclosed amounts of that money were used in  get-out-the-vote efforts supporting La Raza political positions. La Raza has been added to congressional hearings and  an anonymous senator even gave the Council of La Raza an extra $4 million in earmarked taxpayer money, supposedly for  housing reform,  according to Human Events.

Notorious former KKK Grand Dragon David Duke is letting the entire world know how happy he is to have Trump leading the ticket.On his radio show yesterday, white supremacist David Duke celebrated Donald Trump s victory in Indiana, which made him the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Duke also used the show as yet another opportunity to promote his virulent brand of anti-Semitism, blaming Jewish  neo-cons  for trying to destroy Trump s candidacy and for allegedly controlling the country.Duke asserted that  Jewish extremists have made a terribly crazy miscalculation, because all they re going to be doing by doing a  Never Trump  move ment is exposing their alien, their anti-American, anti-American-majority position.   They re going to push people more into an awareness that the neo cons are the problem, that these Jewish supremacists who con trol our country are the real problem, and the rea son why America is not great. Duke has been on the so-called  Trump Train  for months, expressing pride that for the first time in decades a candidate for one of America s two major parties was openly expressing some of the ideas that the white supremacist movement does.The hate leader loves that Trump has been demonizing Latinos as criminals and  rapists,  while the former Klansman also agrees with Trump s plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and his idea of limiting Muslim travel into the United States.It isn t just Duke. Trump has attracted backing from anti-Semites and other bigots, who he has often amplified on social media.

"May 6, 2015","Chuck Norris wrote about Jade Helm 15 in a commentary for the conservative website WND last weekend, pointing to the decision of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to have the Texas State Guard monitor the Pentagon s Jade Helm 15 military ops as evidence that the operations as a potential threat to the state s sovereignty.  Governor Abbott wrote:  During the training operation, it is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed.  And Abbott is demanding  regular updates on the progress and safety of the Operation. Norris fanned the conspiracy flames by writing:  Concerned Texans and Americans are in no way calling into question our brave and courageous men and women in uniform. They are merely following orders. What s under question are those who are pulling the strings at the top of Jade Helm 15 back in Washington. The US government says,  It s just a training exercise.  But I m not sure the term  just  has any reference to reality when the government uses it. A covert training operation by U.S. military special operations personnel, Jade Helm 15, is taking place in a several states this summer, spreading panic and conspiracy theories as to the true purpose of the mission.The two-month simulation spans much of the Southwest, requiring special forces from four branches of the military to carry out covert operations amid  hostile  territory in Texas, Utah and part of California.In at least one of those states, hostility toward the operation has begun a few months early. Online and at in-person meetings, many Texans have expressed suspicion and outright opposition to the project. Some are understandably worried about how it ll affect their daily lives, while conspiracy theorists claim it s an attempt to institute martial law.The military says that they are merely preforming training exercises to help hone soldiers  skills in the event they face a foreign threat, but some citizens are worried that planners have something more domestic in mind.Events for the exercise are outlined in a map among unclassified documents posted online last month. Army sources have verified to The Washington Post that the map is legitimate.Many have speculated that the American government isn t far from declaring martial law, an idea only bolstered by these training exercises.In an anonymous email sent to Dave Hodges at The Common Sense Show, a self-described Texas Ranger said that train cars outfitted with prison-type shackles have been moving about Texas. While he added that the Department of Homeland Security claimed the train cars were for transporting captured terrorists, he was apparently reluctant to believe them. He wrote: We have been told by Homeland that these trains are slated for transporting captured terrorists, non-domestic. We are not sure we can trust this explanation because Homeland is keeping a lot from us and we are growing increasingly uncomfortable with their presence in Texas.  The paranoia about Jade Helm, which started on websites like Alex Jones s InfoWars, had started with familiar fulmination about a mass seizure of firearms or a cover-up for American  death squads. This week, Texas Governor Greg Abbott asked the Texas state guard to monitor the exercise for any violations of freedom.  It is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed,  said the governor.Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said Saturday that he d been hearing concerns about Jade Helm 15, and reached out to the Pentagon for answers. My office has reached out to the Pentagon to inquire about this exercise. We are assured it is a military training exercise. I have no reason to doubt those assurances, but I understand the reason for concern and uncertainty, because when the federal government has not demonstrated itself to be trustworthy in this administration, the natural consequence is that many citizens don t trust what it is saying.  The Texas Senator, speaking at the South Carolina Republican Convention went on to say: I understand a lot of the concerns raised by a lot of citizens about Jade Helm. And I think part of the reason is we have seen, for six years, a federal government disrespecting the liberty of the citizens. That produces fear, when you see a government that is attacking our free speech rights, or Second Amendment rights, or religious liberty rights. That produces distrust.   Just because you re paranoid,  said Cruz,  doesn t mean they re not out to get you. Via: TPNN",IS JADE HELM 15 REALLY ABOUT MARTIAL LAW? Texas Ranger Relays What He Saw Inside Military Trains

According to local station WDBJ7, the shooting took place just before noon, while the business was closed to the public.Roanoke City Police Department and Roanoke Fire EMS were called to the scene. The shooting victim was transferred to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, where she is being treated for non life-threatening injuries.According to a statement released by the company, the injured employee works in an administrative position.The company stated: All of our employees undergo required firearm safety training upon hiring, and this unfortunate incident shows that even experienced firearm owners must be ever-vigilant and aware of the responsibilities associated with safe handling. According to the NRA, guns make for a safer society. Following that line of reasoning, a gun shop should be the safest place in the world. This is just one of many incidents where people have been accidentally or purposely injured by a firearm while surrounded by guns.On January 9, 2015, for example, four people were shot inside a gun store in Shawnee, Kansas.A few months later, a Fayetteville, NC man shot himself in the leg while attending a gun show.In November 2015, two men were shot at a gun show in Idaho when a vendor  accidentally fired a rifle. In January of this year, somewhere between one and three people were shot at a gun show in Ohio. Authorities were unable to determine the exact number of people who were shot at that event.Also in January of this year, two people were killed and two others injured during a father-son shootout at a gun store in Mississippi.All of the people involved in these shootings were surrounded by guns when they were injured or killed. Contrary to what the NRA says, being surrounded by guns does not make a person less likely to get shot. In fact, the opposite is true. The more guns that people have access to, the greater their risk of being injured or killed by one.Featured image via Ratha Grimes via Flickr cc 2.0 ", Whoops: VA Gun Shop Employee Accidentally Shoots Herself
"May 6, 2017","Montel Williams, who has been fighting Multiple Sclerosis since 1999, ripped the GOP s hideous health care bill, and the Republicans who voted for it, to pieces.The American Health Care Act guts the protections for pre-existing conditions that Obamacare had provided. Under the AHCA, states could opt out of federal regulations and allow insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions as much as they want. This means that sick people, the very people who need medical care the most, could find themselves priced out of insurance coverage.Williams, who has been a vocal advocate for MS, weighed in on the bill during an interview with CNN on Saturday. When by asked by Ana Cabrera what he thought of the AHCA, Williams did not hold back.What people at home don t understand, when you say terms and things like pre-existing conditions, they really are basing this on what an insurance company has stated was a pre-existing condition.So, they think about 22 percent of Americans have a problem right this minute. This is from the National Institutes of Health. Over 56 percent of adult Americans, 120 million adult Americans, have one chronic illness. And around 80 percent of them have at least two.So these numbers that people throw out are so wrong.Cabrera pointed out that Republicans have promised  access  to health care, but what they really mean is that you can get insurance coverage if you are rich enough to pay for it. Williams said that he is lucky to be able to afford whatever health insurance he needs, but most Americans don t have that luxury.He went on to say that many MS patients are already unable to get the medications they need to control this debilitating neurological condition because they don t have insurance. Williams explained that the medication he himself is on costs over $1,500 a month. I also have MS, and the price tag for just one of my medications tops $100,000 a year.Williams says that we need to worry about lowering costs, not signing people s death warrants with heinous bills like the AHCA. He explains that the  normal American  can t afford to pay these kinds of prices for the medicines  that keep them alive.

There isn t much evidence of those claims, and as he consolidates his power at the head of the Republican Party, his words reveal a dangerous lack of knowledge about global economics.In an interview with CNBC (on the phone, of course) Trump proposed a radical idea. He told the interviewer that he would reduce the national debt by having the United States fail to pay back on the money it owes. I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal,  he told CNBC.  And if the economy was good, it was good. So, therefore, you can t lose. Trump doesn t seem to understand that the United States economy isn t one of his many, many casinos and other ventures that he sent into bankruptcy at the expense of his investors (and rarely himself). To set him straight, Gene Sperling, who was an economic adviser to Presidents Clinton and Obama, released a statement lacerating Trump s insane proposal: For Donald Trump to casually announce he would consider defaulting on our debt for the first time in our history shows a stunning lack of responsibility and understanding of the global economy,  he said.Sperling also pointed out that Trump s plan  would risk a global financial meltdown, drive up interest rates for Americans for decades, and seriously harm middle-class families. In case anyone might think that this is simply a case of a Democrat hitting Trump, Republicans and business experts also think his idea is bonkers:Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury Department under former President George W. Bush and a vocal member of the  Never Trump  movement, called the comments  dumb as a bucket of rocks.  Fortune Editor Alan S. Murray called them  scary. In Trump s first week as the Republican standard-bearer, he s revealing just how ill-prepared he is to govern, more than even your average modern Republican.Featured image via Flickr", Experts Warn This Trump Plan Would Cause ‘Global Financial Meltdown’
"May 7, 2017","Last year, Trump claimed he was succeeding at saving manufacturing jobs by making individual deals with individual companies, like Carrier in Indiana. At the time, people pointed out that he was boasting about the Carrier deal while totally ignoring another Indiana company, Rexnord, that was likewise shipping its jobs to Mexico.And now, Rexnord has done so. NBC News did a report on the plant s closure, which Trump must have watched because he felt the need to lay the blame for this on Obama shortly after it aired:Rexnord of Indiana made a deal during the Obama Administration to move to Mexico. Fired their employees. Tax product big that s sold in U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2017The funny thing is that if he hadn t been bragging about how great he was at saving manufacturing jobs the instant he won the election, and threatening companies who were trying to outsource, he might actually have a case to make. But he promised to save these kinds of jobs and implied that he would do it company by company if he had to.All he did with Rexnord was tweet at them, which did nothing to sway their decision. And their employees feel as though Trump failed them. As one employee said: In the long run, he s done forgot about us  cause he s moved on to bigger and better things. Perhaps this little plant was just too little for Trump to bother with. The move will save Rexnord tens of millions of dollars, because they can pay Mexican workers $3 per hour vs. the $25 per hour they were paying their American workers. Regardless, this is what Trump said back in December, shortly after claiming victory with both Ford and Carrier:Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016To our knowledge, Trump never even tried to save these jobs despite calling this company out and threatening them with huge tariffs should they actually do this. This is on his head, not Obama s.

"May 8, 2015","How very  charitable  of the Lutheran and Catholic churches to bring tens of thousands of refugees to America, dump them off, and expect the American taxpayer to fund their existence Michigan Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence cheers the news that more money is coming to her district for illegal aliens magically transformed into refugees.What she won t understand until it is too late, is that the arrival of thousands of refugees in Michigan will squeeze Americans, especially the African Americans, at the bottom rung of the pay scale. Michigan is in the top five states receiving refugees and yet they are adding alien children into the mix.But, what the heck, even as states increase poverty, these  church  groups have to make a living!From the Detroit Free Press:WASHINGTON   The Obama administration has awarded a Michigan social services group $2.2 million to house unaccompanied immigrant children, U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence announced today. US Rep Brenda Lawrence is happy that the Lutherans are flooding Michigan with refugees and alien children. It was not immediately known how many children would receive or had received residential services under the grant to Lutheran Social Services of Michigan or whether any other groups were receiving grants in the state as well.No surprise! No one will return calls!Calls and emails to Lutheran Social Services of Michigan and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, from the Free Press seeking more information were not immediately returned.According to data on the ORR s website, only 235 unaccompanied immigrant children had been placed in Michigan in the last two years, far less than the number placed in neighboring states including Ohio. [I wonder if the new grant is in anticipation of Michigan getting more of the UACs ed]Some 63,000 undocumented children have been placed throughout the U.S. in the last two years, the ORR s website said.In announcing the grant, Lawrence, D-Southfield, said the grant assists unaccompanied minors who  seek relief from the violence and poverty that threatens their very existence in their home countries. They can hardly be described as being faith-based while living off of taxpayer boodle! Doesn t sound like Christian charity to me! Lutheran Social Services truly lives up to their faith-based mission statement to serve the people most in need of help and I am proud to see them receive this substantial federal grant,  she said, adding that she believes it also time for Congress to address comprehensive immigration reform.Lutheran Social Services of Michigan is the largest refugee resettlement agency in the state, Lawrence said, providing thousands of families from dozens of countries.So, it is the Lutherans resettling most of the Muslim refugees to Michigan?Other of the nine major contractors are also busy overloading Michigan, go here to see the handy list of subcontractors/contractors working in Michigan and your state too!For new readers, for years we have covered the  unaccompanied minors  (one of the government s original names for the youths illegally crossing the border).

"May 8, 2016","More and more traditional Republicans are coming out against the inevitable presidential candidacy of the trainwreck that is Donald Trump. The latest is Ben Stowe, of the ultra-conservative blog Red State. Stowe appeared on CNN s Reliable Sources, and host Ben Stelter asked him about Trump   specifically about the  Hillary you know  and the  Trump you don t know.  Stowe didn t mince words on Trump, though. He said of the reality star and business mogul turned clown car politician: No, I think I know exactly who I m getting. I think I m getting a sociopathic maniac. And not only do I feel like that s who I m getting, I think that if Donald Trump was president we have four years of him defining conservatism. Stowe seems to be worried about Trump s redefining of what it means to be an American conservative, and about Trump s clear and inevitable destruction of the Republican Party as we know it. He referenced the other idiot GOPers who are clearly on the wrong side of history when it comes to cultural differences regarding social issues, and continued to express worry regarding Trump s outrageous and destructive positions. He continued: It s been bad enough with some of the people we ve had define conservatism over the last several years. To have Donald Trump be our standard bearer I think would be so destructive, I don t know if we can recover. This is going to be a third party situation if we can t get him to lose the election. The thing is, though, there are some conservatives who are falling in lockstep with support of Trump, including Fox News, who Ted Cruz referred to as the  Donald Trump network.  Howe isn t drinking the Trump Kool-Aid though, and warned his GOP compatriots: I think it s a matter of, he creates ratings. I want to address this idea that we were all missing in action when Obamacare came around, when the stimulus came around,  he said refuting that the right didn t attack the President enough.  I was out there marching with the Tea Party in 2009  the fact that I m now coming out against Donald Trump is actually very consistent. I m against liberalism in the destruction of conservatism and that s what Trump represents.

"May 9, 2016","Donald Trump has left a slime trail across multiple decades as a public figure, reality TV star, serial misogynist and now presidential candidate. During the Republican primaries, many wondered why his fellow candidate pulled their punches, often until it was too late and he had already secured the nomination.By contrast, Democrats don t seem as if they plan to let Trump get away with the same sort of shenanigans he did within the GOP. Hillary Clinton has already begun promoting web videos taking on Trump and his racist, sexist, misogynist comments. But the real advertising power is expected to come from the super PACs, who are able to accept an unlimited amount of money (thanks to the Citizens United decision).Priorities USA, who supported President Obama s re-election and produced ads attacking Mitt Romney s record at Bain Capital, will be up on the air in June with ads hitting Trump. Our job is to be as prepared as we can to take him on in any particular instance and that s why not only will we be up on June 8, as previously reported, but we re actually going to go on the air earlier,  Guy Cecil, the head of Priorities USA, told Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on Bloomberg Television s  With All Due Respect. Of the $91 million of air time the super-PAC has already reserved, Cecil estimates that roughly one quarter to one third of ads will be positive, with the rest painting Trump in a negative light.Cecil also estimated that about $40 million will be dedicated to online outreach targeting blacks, Latinos, the Democratic base and millennials.Cecil told Bloomberg that Priorities will be attacking Trump will highlight his smears of women, veterans, as well as his shady business dealings.

Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee (which is conducting its own investigation into Russia), just dropped a truth bomb about Comey, and Trump would be wise to go find a cave and hide in it now.Schiff was asked, on CNN, whether he believes this is a cover-up. He doesn t. He thinks it s something worse: It s a brazen interference with a criminal investigation. After all, the president calls this whole investigation a fake, and here you had an FBI director who was seriously looking into whether Trump associates were colluding with the Russians.

They ve been trying to bend the FBI to their will for a long time, and when Comey wouldn t lie under oath for them, or end his Russia probe, Trump decided to fire him.In fact, Jeff Sessions was actually told to find reasons to fire Comey, and they ve been working on it for at least a week. Trump likely wants someone in that position who ll end that investigation before they discover something really damning. He wants a puppet.If Trump was innocent, the White House wouldn t have been looking for reasons to fire Comey now.

Godspeed Fred Thompson, a former U.S. senator from Tennessee, GOP presidential candidate, Watergate attorney and actor who starred on the television drama  Law and Order,  died on Sunday in Nashville. He was 73.Mr. Thompson died after a recurrence of lymphoma, according to a prepared statement issued by the Thompson family. Mr Thompson, who had recently purchased a house in Nashville to return to Tennessee, was first diagnosed with cancer in 2004. It is with a heavy heart and a deep sense of grief that we share the passing of our brother, husband, father, and grandfather who died peacefully in Nashville surrounded by his family,  the Thompson family s statement reads. Fred once said that the experiences he had growing up in small-town Tennessee formed the prism through which he viewed the world and shaped the way he dealt with life,  his family said.  Fred stood on principle and common sense, and had a deep love for and connection with the people across Tennessee whom he had the privilege to serve in the United States Senate. He enjoyed a hearty laugh, a strong handshake, a good cigar, and a healthy dose of humility. Fred was the same man on the floor of the Senate, the movie studio, or the town square of Lawrenceburg, his home. ]Here is Fred Thompson explaining  Federalism.  It would be great if this video was mandatory viewing for every student in grades K-12:Standing at least 6 feet, 5 inches with a booming voice, Mr. Thompson and his larger-than-life persona played a role in several key moments that shaped the U.S. and Tennessee political landscape.As an attorney, he helped lead to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

And for good reason. Wikileaks recently released an email chain where her aides talked of sobering up the Democratic presidential candidate.An Aug. 2015 email from communications aide Jennifer Palmieri instructs campaign chairman John Podesta to locate and sober Hillary up so that she can return or respond to documents that were emailed to her hours before. I think you should call her and sober her up some,  Palmieri said.The Wikileaks email chain between Palmieri and Podesta shows that Clinton was not reachable throughout the entire afternoon on Aug 8. Additionally, other emails released by Wikileaks and Judicial Watch indicate Clinton sleeps well into mid afternoon on many days and as secretary of state, overslept and missed key national security meetings and daily briefings.New York Times national reporter Amy Chozick covered the Clinton s vicious primary campaign in 2008 against Barack Obama.

"Nov 10, 2015","It looks like it s safe for everyone to pack up their little victim tents and head back to the dorms Something stinks at the University of Missouri.A reported incident of vandalism at Mizzou sparked university-wide protests, a boycott by the school s 4-5 football team, and eventually the resignation of the university s president and chancellor.There s only one problem: no evidence of the alleged incident, in which a poop swastika on the wall of a dormitory restroom was reported, has ever been made publicly available. Did this incident occur as reported, or was it an immaculate defecation that formed the foundation of an unimaginable deception?According to Billy Donley, the president of Mizzou s Residence Halls Association (RHA), the poop swastika was reported at approximately 2:00 a.m. on October 24, 2015. On Saturday, October 24th, at 2:00am an individual came into one of the restrooms in Gateway Hall and drew a swastika on the wall with their own feces,  Donley wrote in a letter several days after the alleged incident.  This event happened while many students, including myself, were already asleep. Later in his letter, Donley noted that he only founded out about the alleged vandalism incident  via a flyer posted on the walls  of the dorm.Although Donley did not respond to repeated requests for comment prior to publication, The Federalist spoke with two RHA staffers while trying to get in touch with Donley. Neither had personally witnessed the poop swastika. When asked if there was any photographic evidence of the alleged incident, one staffer replied,  Not to my knowledge. Frankie Minor, the director of residential life at Mizzou, did not respond to repeated requests for comment on whether he personally saw the poop swastika or any photographic evidence of it.The Federalist also attempted to contact Christian Basi, the associate director of the University of Missouri News Bureau, who previously told the Columbia Missourian on Oct. 30 that the incident had been immediately reported to Mizzou police. Basi did not respond to requests for comment prior to the publication of this article.Calls to the University of Missouri Police Department, which responded to and investigated the alleged poop swastika incident, also failed to yield any evidence of the poopstika.Multiple activists on Twitter pointed to this photo as proof that the incident occurred as reported, but a Google search for the same image shows that it has been floating around the Internet for nearly a year. A reddit thread from November of 2014 appears to contain the earliest publication of the photo in question, meaning that it most certainly does not constitute proof of the incident alleged to have occurred at Mizzou on October 24, 2015.Maj. Brian Weimer, the public information officer for the Mizzou police department, told The Federalist that he also did not personally see the poop swastika that was reported to police. When asked if anyone in the police department personally witnessed the swastika, Maj. Weimer clammed up and referred all questions about the incident to the university s custodian of public records.The Federalist also repeatedly contacted @ConcernedStudent1950, the Twitter account representing Mizzou protesters who issued a series of demands of university administrators after the alleged poop swastika incident made headlines. The individuals running the @CS1950 account failed to produce any photographic or documentary evidence of the incident prior to publication of this article.While a mere absence of evidence is not synonymous with evidence of absence, the complete lack of any verifiable photographic evidence of the alleged poop swastika and the lack of any named eye witnesses raises serious questions about the veracity of a racially charged incident of vandalism that eventually led to the resignation of the University of Missouri s two top administrators.Did the incident happen as reported, or did two university administrators resign over protests that were sparked by a hoax? And if the incident did happen as reported, a proposition for which no publicly available evidence currently exists, how did university administrators and law enforcement authorities confirm that the vandalism was driven by racial animosity, as opposed to being promulgated as a public relations stunt meant to tar the university for failing to provide an environment free of racist invective? It would not be the first time a public university fell victim to a high profile PR stunt that was later revealed to be a fabrication. Either way, students, their parents, university employees, and Missouri taxpayers deserve solid, verifiable answers based on clear evidence about what exactly transpired in that Gateway Wall bathroom in the early morning of October 24.Under the provisions of Missouri s broad public records laws, The Federalist has requested from the University of Missouri copies of any and all records relating to the alleged vandalism, including any police or incident reports describing the investigation of the poop swastika by law enforcement authorities, as well as any photographic records of the alleged swastika, and will make that information available if and when it is received from university officials.

"Nov 10, 2017","Infowars uncovered a bombshell when they discovered the Facebook page of one of Judge Roy Moore s accusers, Debbie Gibson, who came out in a Washington Post article to accuse him of sexual misconduct that allegedly took place 36 years ago.Debbie Wesson Gibson says that she was 17 in the spring of 1981 when Moore spoke to her Etowah High School civics class about serving as the assistant district attorney. She says that when he asked her out, she asked her mother what she would say if she wanted to date a 34-year-old man. Gibson says her mother asked her who the man was, and when Gibson said  Roy Moore,  her mother said,  I d say you were the luckiest girl in the world. Among locals in Gadsden, a town of about 47,000 back then, Moore  had this godlike, almost deity status   he was a hometown boy made good,  Gibson says,  West Point and so forth. Gibson says that they dated for two to three months, and that he took her to his house, read her poetry and played his guitar. She says he kissed her once in his bedroom and once by the pool at a local country club. Looking back, I m glad nothing bad happened,  says Gibson, who now lives in Florida.  As a mother of daughters, I realize that our age difference at that time made our dating inappropriate. Debbie Gibson hates Donald Trump, but that s not all, she s pretty fond of Judge Roy Moore s opponent, Doug Ross for US Senate In Alabama as well Here are a few anti-Trump posts that were found on Gibson s Facebook page: One of senatorial candidate Roy Moore s accusers is apparently a fervent Democrat who has worked for the DNC as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, a revelation which the Washington Post never included in its original report.The accuser, Debbie Gibson, had also publically supported Moore s opponent Doug Jones before the accusations came to light.Gibson openly bragged about signing for Hillary during a campaign appearance. On a side note, we re not sure who she s signing for. The crowd behind Hillary, that is usually packed with the Democrats hand-picked  diverse  crowd, appears to be pretty thin.Here s a post from Gibson s page proving that she s supporting Judge Roy Moore s Democrat opponent for US Senate:She even posted a video of Moore s opponent, Doug Jones to promote him to her friends on Facebook.

"Nov 11, 2015"," The question is not how Hillary will ever be able to repay the kindness of so many donors to the Clinton Slush Fund/Clinton Charity the question is how will America survive her pay-backs?According to donation records, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation   which funds global vaccine distribution   has donated at least $26 million to the Clinton charity, though records appear to be incomplete so the amount could be higher.On Thursday, a week after former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates argued for amnesty and for an unlimited number of high-tech guest-worker visas, Microsoft announced it would slash 18,000 jobs. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella promised his employees that  we will go through this process in the most thoughtful and transparent way possible.  Analysts told USA Today that the number being let go was  larger than expected. The  vast majority  of employees will reportedly be notified  within the next six months  and  earn severance and job transition help in many locations.  Microsoft employs 125,000 people.Bill Gates, along with Sheldon Adelson and Warren Buffett, advocated removing  the worldwide cap on the number of visas that could be awarded to legal immigrants who had earned a graduate degree in science, technology, engineering or mathematics from an accredited institution of higher education in the United States. However, numerous nonpartisan scholars and studies have determined that there is a surplus   not a shortage   of American high-tech workers. Moreover, after a recent Census report found that  74% of those with a bachelor s degree in these subjects don t work in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) jobs,  the mainstream media may finally be catching on and taking away the high-tech industry s  free pass.  CBS News, for instance, concluded that the Census data suggest the high-tech industry s contention that there is a shortage of American high-tech  is largely a myth. Ron Hira, a public policy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has  said there are 50% more graduates than job openings in the STEM fields.  Microsoft s announcement hammers home his point that the IT sector has often been  an area of social mobility,  and removing the caps on high-tech guest-worker visas would take jobs away from American workers and make it more difficult to climb the economic ladder. You ve got people who come from working-class backgrounds who go into these sectors,  Hira said on a conference call of scholars earlier this year that Sen. Jeff Sessions'(R-AL) office organized.  It s a way of getting into the middle class and the professional class, and that s being cut off.

"Nov 11, 2016","Trump began a more targeted outreach to Catholics after hiring Catholic Steve Bannon of Breitbart.com to be his campaign chairman, releasing a message to Catholics over the weekend promising to fight for Catholics  values.In what the Wall Street Journal is calling  one of the biggest upsets in U.S. political history,  Donald Trump won the presidential election with 290 electoral college votes to Hillary Clinton s 232. Not only did he win the electoral votes by a wide margin, he secured the Catholic vote by margins larger than those enjoyed by any Republican candidate in the last five elections.Leading into Election Day, polls had Trump leading Clinton with Catholics as many as 20 points, with the November 3 IBD/TIPP poll showing 54 percent of Catholics would vote for Trump as opposed to only 34 percent for Clinton. Although that margin began decreasing towards Tuesday, the final results show more Catholics voted for Trump than for his opponent.A Pew Research poll compares the numbers, and shows that Trump won the Catholic vote by a 7-percent margin   larger than that enjoyed by George W. Bush in 2004, the last time more Catholics favored the Republican candidate over the Democrat.A CNN national exit poll shows that, of the 23 percent of voters who identified as Catholic in this election, 52 percent voted for Trump, while only 45 percent voted for Clinton.Compare the numbers with the 2012 race between Obama and Mitt Romney, where 25 percent of voters were Catholic and 50 percent of that number voted for Obama as opposed to 48 percent for Romney. The margin was even wider in 2008, where 27 percent of voters were Catholic, with 54 percent of them supporting Obama over only 45 percent for Republican hopeful John McCain.Read more: Church Militant",THE NUMBERS ARE IN: Here’s How The Catholics Voted In This Historic Election

"Nov 12, 2015","The USPS is drowning in debt, has lost every one of its life-lines and has mismanaged its funds for decades. No worries though, the US Postal Union is quite certain Socialist Santa Claus will fix everything Presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won the endorsement of the American Postal Workers Union on Thursday, giving the self-described democratic socialist a boost as he seeks more support from organized labor in the Democratic primary.APWU represents 200,000 U.S. Postal Service employees and retirees. It s the second major national union and member of the AFL-CIO labor federation to endorse Sanders over rival and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.Sanders  stands above all others as a true champion of postal workers and other workers throughout the country,  said Mark Dimondstein, the union s president, in a statement. The endorsement came from the union s 13-member executive board.The United States Postal Service (USPS) lost $5.5 billion last year. That is the eighth annual loss in a row and the third-highest ever. The only silver lining is that the loss was below the red-ink tsunami of $15.9 billion in 2012.Why does the federal government deliver the mail? Why does it have a monopoly over delivering the mail?Admittedly, the Postal Service is one of the few government programs with actual constitutional warrant. The Constitution authorizes Congress to establish post offices. And early American politicians rushed to take advantage of their opportunity, creating the Post Office Department in 1792.With politics rather than service as the post office s priority, Congress took the next step and approved the Private Express Statutes, which prevented anyone from competing with the government in delivering first-class mail. And Uncle Sam enforced his monopoly, fining would-be competitors, including celebrated libertarian author Lysander Spooner.The feds continue to prosecute anyone with the temerity to compete with the USPS, even threatening the Cub Scouts for once offering to deliver Christmas cards.Believing that Americans existed to serve the USPS left the system ill-equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. In 1971, Congress turned the Post Office Department into the semi-independent USPS. That removed its direct role in politics, but the USPS still is exempt from taxes and regulations, including local parking restrictions. Congress retained its control over postal policies and, of course, preserved the system s delivery monopoly.But banning competition could not preserve the postal market. The number of pieces of mail peaked in 2001 and continues to fall despite a rising population. Mail pieces dropped from 213 billion in 2006 to 155 billion last year, and the number is expected to decline to 130 billion by 2020. The USPS s last profitable year was 2006. Since then, losses have run between $2.8 billion and $15.9 billion. The Postal Service has maxed out its borrowing from Uncle Sam and missed four retiree program payments. With characteristic understatement, the Government Accountability Office observed,  Given its financial problems and outlook, USPS cannot support its current level of service and operations. The postal unions insist that nothing is wrong   at least, nothing that a federal bailout wouldn t solve. They reserve particular ire for the requirement that the USPS prefund workers  retirement. Had this rule not been in place, noted former postmaster general Patrick Donahoe, the Postal Service would have earned money last year.But prefunding protects taxpayers. Washington s unfunded (government) retirement liability is about $800 billion and growing every year. That no other agency is required to prefund is unfair to taxpayers, not the Postal Service, since every agency should have to set aside sufficient money to fulfill its financial promises. With the Postal Service earning too little to pay and with nothing left of its federal credit line, the USPS has defaulted four times over the last three years on its mandated contributions.Sanders has long been a vocal backer of a robust postal service, particularly during the postal reform debate of recent years. APWU views itself as fighting a battle against postal service privatization, and it counts the Vermont senator as perhaps its leading defender.As the postal service bleeds millions in losses   mostly due to unique funding mandates placed upon it by Congress   Sanders has staunchly opposed the closure of postal facilities and cuts in postal service, such as Saturday delivery. He is also a leading proponent of the concept of postal banking, which would allow post offices to provide small loans and compete with payday lenders. Postal banking is a top issue for APWU, and Sanders has sought to make it a campaign issue.In his statement, Dimondstein noted Sanders  long history of standing with workers on picket lines, as well as his support for a national $15 per hour minimum wage. Sanders spoke at a protest against Verizon last month that was held by the Communications Workers of America union, and he joined a Fight for $15 rally outside the U.S. Capitol building earlier this week.Via: Huffington Post ",GOVERNMENT SANTA CANDIDATE Gets Another Huge Endorsement… Just In Time For Christmas

"Nov 12, 2017","Last week, the Washington Post reported that after almost 4 decades, 4 women came forward to claim they were sexually abused as teenagers, by Roy Moore, the GOP candidate for senator in Alabama. Nevermind that for 4 decades they were silent about Moore s alleged behavior, and that only 4 weeks before the election, they all decided to confide in the leftist rag who just endorsed Moore s Democrat opponent, Doug Ross for Senate.It was discovered last week that one of the women who accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct actually worked for Hillary as a  signer  at her campaign, openly trashed President Trump and pushed her friends to support Moore s opponent on her personal Facebook page.Meanwhile, the allegations against Moore continue to unravel, as the mother of Leigh Corfman, who says that Alabama Senatorial Candidate Roy Moore tried to engage in a sexual encounter with her when she was 14, told Breitbart News that the Washington Post worked to convince her daughter to give an interview about the allegations against Moore. Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Corfman s mother, Nancy Wells, 71, further stated that her daughter would not have come forward if it weren t for The Post reporter s alleged actions.Earlier on Sunday, Breitbart News reported that Corfman s mother contradicted a key detail of Corfman s story. Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Wells said that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman   purportedly on Corfman s bedroom phone   to arrange at least one encounter.The Washington Post cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14. She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.Today, the left got some very bad new about their hit job on Roy Moore it appears that polls show Alabama voters aren t buying it Breitbart News   Two new polls demonstrate that GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate Judge Roy Moore remains unaffected entirely by smears in the Washington Post against him, and his lead before the Post piece on Thursday afternoon remains intact. One of the polls, which were both provided by the pollster to Breitbart News exclusively on Saturday evening, was conducted on Thursday morning before the publication of the Post piece that afternoon. The second one was conducted on Saturday evening. Together, they show Judge Moore s lead over Democrat Doug Jones has been virtually unaffected since the Post story came out.The first survey, which was conducted entirely before noon local time on Thursday, shows Moore leading Jones by 50 percent to 39.2 percent with 10.8 percent undecided. That survey of 1,354 likely voters in the upcoming Dec. 12 special election has a margin of error of 3.5 percent.The second survey, conducted Saturday evening two days after the Post piece hit, roiling Alabama s political scene shows Moore and Jones with about the exact same percentages as before. Moore s position in this second poll is 49.8 percent meaning he only dropped 0.2 percent since the story hit and Jones has only picked up 0.4 percent to reach 39.6 percent total. The second survey, which polled 1,536 likely voters with a margin of error of 3.3 percent, has 10.5 percent as undecided. The polling between Thursday morning and Saturday showed far less movement than I originally expected,  pollster John Wahl told Breitbart News.  The controversy surrounding the Washington Post article seems to have galvanized the support of both candidates, but not changed the actual percentages in a significant manner. The Moore campaign has already weathered a considerable amount of political attacks during this campaign season, and I expect most of his lightest support to have blown off during these attacks. His current support level is holding fairly steady. Another liberal publication, The Hill, reported that Moore was losing in the polls to Jones after the hit piece on Moore was published in the Washington Post.The Hill -Democrat Doug Jones is leading Republican Roy Moore in Alabama s Senate race in the wake of explosive accusations of sexual misconduct against Moore, according to a new poll released Sunday.Forty-six percent of likely voters polled said they would vote for Jones, while 42 percent said they would vote for Moore, according to the Louisiana-based JMC Analytics and Polling.The survey was conducted on Nov. 9 and Nov. 11, after The Washington Post reported that a woman said Moore had initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979, when she was 14 years old and he was 32.The RealClearPolitics poll has Moore and Jones tied. The poll showing Moore losing to Jones was conducted by JMP, the same polling operation who gave us this hilariously inaccurate poll, only one week before the general election in 2016:We re gonna go out on a limb, and say that this so-called scandal involving Judge Roy Moore is going to backfire spectacularly on the left, and will ultimately only shine a spotlight on the hypocrisy of the Democrat Party, who ignored the sexual misconduct of former President Bill Clinton and his enabling wife, Hillary Clinton for decades.

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me:  I lift my lamp beside the golden door. After the Hayride broke the exclusive story on 10,000 Syrian refugees possibly resettling in Baton Rouge, Lafayette and Metairie, it has now come to light that refugees are already coming into the New Orleans area.Catholic Charities, which receive federal grants from U.S. Department of State/Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, have apparently taken in two Syrian refugee families already and are expecting many more.There are approximately 180 cities in the country that are eligible to accept the 10,000 Syrian refugees. Here is the full list of those cities, which includes Baton Rouge, Matairie and Lafayette:US Refugee Public Affiliate DirectoryThen, once the refugees arrive in the country, they could be dispersed across the 180 cities listed above, where they are to aided within the first 30 to 90 days in settling and finding employment in the area.After approximately 90 days, refugees are no longer eligible for the State Department-funded support that they were receiving through migrant and refugee services. However, they are able to join support programs through the Department of Health and Human Services.Additionally, it is unclear how much the screening process for the 10,000 Syrian refugees will cost American taxpayers.WIDESPREAD WELFAREHowever, the narrative by the national media tends to be one where immigrants and migrants are portrayed as coming to America and not taking any sort of federal government help. In our research, we found that to be the biggest fallacy of all when it comes to the immigration and migrant issue.In a report by the Congressional Office of Refugee Resettlement, nearly 92 percent of refugees in the country were on food stamps between 2008-2013. Additionally, 73 percent of refugees were on Medicaid, 68 percent were receiving some kind of cash welfare almost 20 percent were in public housing.As Americans continue to debate what to do about the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East, this analysis attempts to estimate the costs of resettling refugees from that region in the United States. Although we do not consider all costs, our best estimate is that in their first five years in the United States each refugee from the Middle East costs taxpayers $64,370   12 times what the UN estimates it costs to care for one refugee in neighboring Middle Eastern countries.The cost of resettlement includes heavy welfare use by Middle Eastern refugees; 91 percent receive food stamps and 68 percent receive cash assistance. Costs also include processing refugees, assistance given to new refugees, and aid to refugee-receiving communities. Given the high costs of resettling refugees in the United States, providing for them in neighboring countries in the Middle East may be a more cost-effective way to help them. Via: The HayrideAmong the findings of this analysis:On average, each Middle Eastern refugee resettled in the United States costs an estimated $64,370 in the first five years, or $257,481 per household.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has requested $1,057 to care for each Syrian refugee annually in most countries neighboring Syria.For what it costs to resettle one Middle Eastern refugee in the United States for five years, about 12 refugees can be helped in the Middle East for five years, or 61 refugees can be helped for one year.UNHCR reports a gap of $2.5 billion in funding that it needs to care for approximately four million Syrians in neighboring countries.The five-year cost of resettling about 39,000 Syrian refugees in the United States is enough to erase the current UNHCR funding gap.The five-year costs of resettlement in the United States include $9,230 spent by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) within HHS and the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) within the State Department in the first year, as well as $55,139 in expenditures on welfare and education.Very heavy use of welfare programs by Middle Eastern refugees, and the fact that they have only 10.5 years of education on average, makes it likely that it will be many years, if ever, before this population will cease to be a net fiscal drain on public coffers   using more in public services than they pay in taxes.It is worth adding that ORR often reports that most refugees are self-sufficient within five years. However, ORR defines  self-sufficiency  as not receiving cash welfare. A household is still considered  self-sufficient  even if it is using any number of non-cash programs such as food stamps, public housing, or Medicaid.Refugees are admitted for humanitarian reasons, not because they are supposed to be self-sufficient, so the drain on public coffers that Middle Eastern refugees create is expected. However, given limited resources, the high cost of resettlement in the United States means careful consideration should be given to alternatives to resettlement if the goal is the help as many people possible.

"Nov 16, 2017","Democratic Senator Al Franken   who has been accused of kissing a woman without her consent and pretending to grope her in a photo   once pitched an SNL sketch about raping a journalist, it has emerged.The remarks were made in 1995, when Franken and other writers on the show were working up a sketch about then-60 Minutes host Andy Rooney finding a bottle of pills in his desk, New York Magazine reported at the time.As the team batted ideas around, Franken suggested that the pills might be used by Rooney to drug Lesley Stahl at which point he would  take her to the closet and rape her .The sketch was part of an ongoing series in which Norm Macdonald portrayed Rooney as an out-of-touch misanthrope with a tenuous grasp on reality.Macdonald had suggested that Rooney could say  I don t know what the pills are for   what I do know is, the bottle is mostly filled with cotton. Franken then chipped in with:  And,  I give the pills to Lesley Stahl. Then, when Lesley s passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her. Or,  That s why you never see Lesley until February.  Or,  When she passes out, I put her in various positions and take pictures of her. Stahl was a contributor to 60 Minutes at the time. Macdonald then asked,  What if Rooney rapes Mike Wallace? And then says,  I guess that makes me bad.  Is it funnier with a black guy? Or two old white guys? Franken responded:  What about,  I drag Mike into my office and rape him. Right here! I guess that makes me bad. The sketch never made it to air, and it s questionable whether it was ever intended to do so.But the 1995 report has now resurfaced   as it did in 2008, when Franken made his successful run for Minnesota Senator.At the time, his campaign said:  Al understands, and the people of Minnesota understand, the difference between what a satirist does and what a senator does. But newly emerged claims that Franken kissed a woman without her consent in 2006, and pretended to grope her in a photo while she was sleeping have been tougher for the comedian to address.

The problem with this is that Franken really HAD TO apologize because he was caught red-handed. A picture of him groping a woman was evidence he made sexual groping a thing in his life.Clinton is clearly trying to play politics with this and uses it in a way that s really dirty. We know Franken is guilty Roy Moore and Donald Trump had no women prove they did anything wrong yet Clinton tries to throw President Trump and Judge Roy Moore under the bus: Speaking to WABC Radio s Rita Cosby, the former Secretary of State instead pointed the finger at President Trump and embattled GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore   claiming they should be viewed as the real predators, and not Franken:WHAT IS THIS WOMAN SMOKING: Look at the contrast between Al Franken, accepting responsibility, apologizing, and Roy Moore and Donald Trump who have done neither. That is the kind of accountability I m talking about. I don t hear that from Roy Moore or Donald Trump. A former Playboy Playmate came forward this week and accused Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, of groping her while the two were on a USO tour in 2006. The senator offered his  sincerest apologies  on Thursday, saying he was just trying to be funny.Franken has inevitably drawn comparisons to Moore and Trump, both of whom have been accused of sexual misconduct.ALLEGATIONSWhile the president has been hit with sexual harassment allegations by numerous women in the past, Moore was only recently accused by his alleged victims in the fallout from the Harvey Weinstein scandal.

Carry on King Barry to hell with the American people For five days a coordinated DC Media has been attacking as racists anyone opposed to President Obama s plan to resettle thousands of Syrians refugees here in America. A new poll shows that the emotional blackmail being hurled by both Obama and his DC Media allies has failed miserably. By nearly 2-to-1 (53% to 28%), Americans oppose the resettlement program.The Obama administration launched a hashtag last night to promote the concept of welcoming Syrian refugees into the United States after a growing number of governors proposed halting the program after the terrorist attacks in Paris.The White House debuted a hashtag on their Facebook page last night: #RefugeesWelcome Even as we intensify our efforts in coordination with our partners to take out ISIL, we cannot turn our backs on those most threatened by the terrorist group,  the message on the White House page read.A video on the page insisted that U.S. law enforcement officials were vetting each of the refugees before allowing them to settle in the United States.On the White House website, Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security Amy Pope denounced Republicans for calling to block refugees in the country.

"Nov 18, 2017","You might remember this bright moment from when Obama was president A couple of years ago, 500 high school choir students sang the Star-Spangled Banner in the 18-story atrium of a Hyatt hotel in Louisville as part of the Kentucky Music Educators Convention. Any anti-anthem liberals in the building probably ran out screaming into the night:Good thing Louisville doesn t have an NFL team. If there had been a visiting team in the building, some of the players would have had to put their helmets on to keep their skulls from exploding.REMEMBER WHEN OBAMA SUPPORTED KAEPERNICK S ANTI-ANTHEM PROTEST? OBAMA DEFENDS KAEPERNICK S Decision to Disrespect American Flag:  He s generated more interest in something that needs to be talked about When Obama had the opportunity to speak out against 49er s quarterback Colin Kaepernick s disrespect for our flag, he chose instead to defend his actions, explaining that it was okay for him to sit out the national anthem, as long as he was bringing attention to the cop-hating/killing, divisive Black Lives Matter terror group President Obama said San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is  exercising his constitutional right  to sit out the national anthem, but the president acknowledged that the silent protest is a  tough thing  for military service members to accept.At a news conference in China on Monday, the president said he did not doubt Kaepernick s sincerity in his decision not to stand for the anthem ahead of games to protest the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement in U.S. cities. Obama noted a  long history  of sports figures protesting political or social issues. There are a lot of ways you can do it,  Obama said after the G-20 summit here.  As a general matter when it comes to the flag and the national anthem and the meaning that holds for our men and women in uniform and those who fought for us   that is a tough thing for them to get past to then hear what his deeper concerns are. But I don t doubt his sincerity. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. If nothing else, he s generated more conversation about issues that have to be talked about. Obama said he has not closely followed the controversy surrounding Kaepernick s actions while he has been overseas, but he said he was aware of the public response, which has been sharply divided. The president has sought to balance his own response to the unrest and mistrust between African Americans and police officers over the past several years, including in Baton Rouge and Dallas this year. You ve heard me talk in the past about the need for us to have an active citizenry,  Obama said.  Sometimes that s messy and controversial and gets people angry and frustrated. But I d rather have young people that are engaged in the argument and trying to think through how they can be part of our democratic process than people just sitting on the sidelines not participating at all. My suspicion is that over time he s going to refine how he thinks about it. Maybe some of his critics will start seeing that he had a point about concerns about justice and equality. That s how we move forward.    Washington Post ",WATCH: Colin Kaepernick’s Worst Nightmare [Video]

Hillary should be on bloody knees every day thanking her lucky stars she s not a Republican .Hillary Clinton gave a speech Thursday at the Council on Foreign Relation, where she outlined her genius plan to defeat ISIS. (Step 1: Defeat ISIS.) She also offered a few more specific proposals [emphasis added]:When it comes to terrorist financing, we have to go after the nodes that facilitate illicit trade and transactions. The U.N. Security Council should update its terrorism sanctions. They have a resolution that does try to block terrorist financing and other enabling activities, but we have to place more obligations on countries to police their own banks, and the United States, which has quite a record of success in this area, can share more intelligence to help other countries. And once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations as well as the schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path to radicalization.Clinton is right about the fact that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have for years funneled money to terrorist groups, essentially bribing them to ensure that they don t cause trouble in their incestual oligarchies. She is certainly right that these oil-rich countries have made a habit of giving away money to powerful interest groups in an effort to curry favor. Some of those groups happen to be comprised of terrorists, while others are charitable foundations founded by a former United States president whose wife is currently seeking the Democratic Party s nomination for the same position in 2016.Here s how much those three countries and their affiliated entities have donated to the Clinton Foundation:Qatar   Up to $5.8 million United Arab Emirates   Up to $11.5 million Saudi Arabia   Up to $50 millionThe gulf nations represent three of the largest donors to the foundation, but that is hardly the extent of their ties to the Clintons. Qatari, UAE, and Saudi firms paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars for speeches during the time Hillary served as secretary of state, when she also approved weapons deals with all three countries worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense firms, many of which are also Clinton Foundation donors.Bill Clinton has praised the Qataris as  intelligent, forward looking  investment partners for their collaboration on Clinton Foundation projects.

Who?  Ball told ESPN when asked about Trump s involvement in the situation.  What was he over there for? Don t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out.

"Nov 2, 2015","Joe Wilson was right!Obviously, there are more than 5 lies Obama has told during his presidency, but who has enough time in the day to count them all? If past presidents are remembered for their signature achievements, Obama will be remembered for his signature lie:  If you like your health care plan, blah, blah, blah.  The reader knows the rest. Although the most consequential of Obama s lies   it got him re-elected   it s far from his only prevarication.I ve counted 75 significant lies since his campaign for president began, but that doesn t begin to tally the casual fibs and hyperbole he spouts seemingly every day. Here are five that illustrate just how much Obama s presidency is built on falsehoods.Obama made this claim in September 2009, when addressing the nation s schoolkids. By then, the blogosphere knew that baby Obama had never spent a night under the same roof as his father, let alone two years. For years, Obama and his advisers invested enormous political capital in what biographer David Remnick called Obama s  signature appeal: the use of the details of his own life as a reflection of a kind of multicultural ideal. Remnick called Obama s autobiography  a mixture of verifiable fact, recollection, recreation, invention and artful shaping.  In other words, the truth is never good enough.Obama spun this fiction at a September 2012 Univision forum knowing it was false. In fact, the bizarre, deadly idea to let American guns  walk  into Mexico, where they were used by drug cartels to kill dozens, began in October 2009. Three months earlier, White House press secretary Jay Carney had made the same bogus claim virtually word for word at a press conference and got shot down on national TV.  It began in fall 2009,  corrected White House correspondent Jake Tapper, then with ABC.Carney refused to acknowledge he lied, and the president continued to lie weeks later. It s all part of Obama s ducking of responsibility   it s always someone else s fault.Obama said this in response to Bill O Reilly s question about the IRS scandal:  You re saying no corruption?  If there were not even a  smidgen of corruption,  as Obama insisted, it is hard to understand what outraged him, or at least seemed to, when news of the IRS scandal first broke.  It s inexcusable, and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it,  Obama said in May 2013. Obama routinely expressed anger when some new scandal erupted on his watch   IRS, the failed ObamaCare website, the VA scandal, Fast and Furious   but never before had he shoved a scandal down the memory hole so quickly.And how could Obama know there wasn t a smidgen of corruption before the investigation was even over? Perhaps because the administration knew that any proof of that was gone with deleted emails and destroyed hard drives?During that same Super Bowl Sunday interview, Obama made this claim in response to O Reilly s inquiry about the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. Obama continued to dissemble:  The notion that we would hide the ball for political purposes when a week later we all said, in fact, there was a terrorist attack taking place and the day after I said it was an act of terror, that wouldn t be a very good coverup.  In fact, it was exactly a week after the attack, on Sept. 18, that Obama took his first questions about Benghazi. Bizarrely, he did so to David Letterman.  Here s what happened,  Obama said. You had a video that was released by somebody who lives here, sort of a shadowy character who   who made an extremely offensive video directed at   at Mohammed and Islam. We know now that the administration knew this wasn t true. Not a week later; not even the very night of the attacks.On many levels, this was Obama s most telling lie. He only deals with the world as he sees it, not as it is.Obama told this whopper to his assembled staff on his first day in office. He promised it to the press. Instead, his administration refuses to hand over documents and Obama refuses to answer questions. As liberal constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley assessed the presidency,  Barack Obama is really the president Richard Nixon always wanted to be.  What do these lies, just a sample of many, tell us? Obama never stopped  artfully shaping  his life.The scary thing is he might actually believe these lies. He believes that posting a shot from his personal photographer online is  transparent.  That targeting conservative groups for audits isn t corrupt. That everything that has gone wrong with his presidency is Bush s fault.Knowing that, how can we believe anything that he says?Jack Cashill is the author of  You Lie!

"Nov 20, 2015","So Sweden basically wants to ensure Muslims returning from raping and beheading innocent people overseas, that the government will help them find a job and receive psychological counseling.  The trauma they must be experiencing after committing Jihad against so many innocent people must be overwhelming   You just can t make these things up The Swedish capital of Stockholm has released its new policy document for dealing with ISIS fighters returning to the city after having had their fill of rape and beheadings of civilians. At first blush it seems strange that such a document would be all of 9 pages.I mean,  Shoot!  should only take up one page, even with a large font.Oh well, let s see how Stockholm intends to handle terrorist-trained and combat-hardened fanatics. Here are a few translated highlights to capture the gist of things: Post-perspective: When a person wishes to leave a violent extremist grouping or coming home from combat overseas, it is crucial to provide customized inclusion efforts. Even then, it is important to have a local cooperation between various actors. Voluntary organizations can provide targeted support and advice. Even faith communities working with advice, but also psychosocial support.When it comes to people who participated in combat there is likely to be great need of health efforts. Therefore, it is important to establish cooperation between social services, social psychiatry and drug units, as well as health centers and psychiatric services (trauma, PTSD, etc.)When it comes to security, it is important that cooperation between social services, income support, employment and other efforts by the Labour Department, as well as assistance with job placement.Finally, the accommodation issue is a prerequisite that must work. Therefore, cooperative housing companies needs to be included in the post-perspective. To summarize: The city of Stockholm will make it a priority to provide the returning ISIS fighters with housing, free health care (physical and mental) and full financial support, until they have received earmarked jobs. All this of course fast-tracked past the line of law-abiding immigrants and indigenous Swedes.Since they now provide all the recruitment incentives for joining ISIS, the only thing missing is a city-run recruitment office. Oh, wait. That would the Employment Office, where it was recently revealed that tax-paid clerks were recruiting for ISIS. Sorry, my mistake!Then it s time to make proactive efforts to discourage radicalization. The solution, the city concludes, is to pour tax money into muslim organizations already in contact with the at-risk persons: Support to associations and other stakeholders locally There are examples of local actors which can contribute to efforts locally. For example, the Islamic Association and the mosque in Rinkeby-Kista has initiated education for interested parents and youths in the J rva area. It is very important to support such local initiatives. It is also important to involve local associations, some of which have contact with residents that the authorities do not come into contact with. As journalist and blogger Per Gudmundson points out, the Islamic Association of Sweden is a remarkably poor choice for  fighting Jihad  since it is the Swedish branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. Their official motto reads: Allah is our goal, the prophet is our leader, the quran is our law, Jihad is our way, and death for the honor of Allah is our greatest desire! Gudmundson notes that they are in active combat in Syria at the moment, in coalition with Jabhat al-Nusrah which is a branch of al-Qaida.

Americans have been bullied into submission by the leftist shame police. We ve been told we re  racists  and  Islamophobes  for even suggesting Islamic terrorists have any ties to Islam. Our government tells us,  If you see something, say something.  But beware of the wrath of the Left if you  say something  against someone who happens to be part of the  protected victim class. If the fact that there are 23 jihad training camps within U.S. borders isn t frightening enough, the fact that president Barack Obama has done absolutely nothing about them should be.According to a document released by the Clarion Project, 23 confirmed terrorist Jihad compounds belonging to Jamaat ul-Fuqra, a Pakastan Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda-related organization, were operating within our own borders.The group of Muslims of America (MOA) are documented to have a connection to terrorism with training inside the United States. There was a 2002 unsolved murder at one of these compounds in Texas. When the Clarion Project obtained the 2007 FBI document detailing the Texas Enclave of MOA, what they found was deeply disturbing.The organization says it has a network of 22  villages  around the U.S., with Islamberg as its main headquarters in New York. TheClarion Project obtained secret MOA footage showing female members receiving paramilitary training at Islamberg. It was featured on the Kelly File on FOX News Channel in October. A second MOA tape released by Clarion shows its spokesman declaring the U.S. to be a Muslim-majority country.A 2007 FBI record states that MOA members have been involved in at least 10 murders, one disappearance, three firebombings, one attempted firebombing, two explosive bombings and one attempted bombing.It states: The MOA is now an autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S. The documented propensity for violence by this organization supports the belief the leadership of the MOA extols membership to pursue a policy of jihad or holy war against individuals or groups it considers enemies of Islam, which includes the U.S. Government. Members of the MOA are encouraged to travel to Pakistan to receive religious and military/terrorist training from Sheikh Gilani. The document also says that,  The MOA is now an autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S.  ~Clarion ProjectJamaat ul-Fuqra is known to be an extremely militant group of international terrorists. The compounds allaegedly provide paramilitary training to new recruits for jihad against America.The document also claimed that Jamaat ul-Fuqra was an  autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S. This document was obtained in 2007, but still nothing has been done about these compounds or their activities.If you re wondering why, the answer lies with our very own president and Department of Homeland Security, which refuse to classify Jamaat ul-Fuqra as a foreign terrorist organization   even though plenty of evidence proving they are terrorists reportedly exists.The fact that Obama has done nothing to stop these groups only reinforces the notion that he chooses to support Muslim interests over American interests, and that is disturbing in every way.What kind of president allows this kind of training to happen in his own backyard?This is as good a reason as any for Americans to exercise their Second Amendment rights. If our president is more worried about being politically correct than he is the safety of our country, then the people deserve the right to defend themselves.Via: Conservative Tribune ",Why Would Obama Regime Allow 23 Jihad Training Camps “Capable Of Mounting Terror Campaigns Within U.S.” To Remain Open?
"Nov 21, 2016","Something was bothering Donald Trump as he made his victory speech after the election. The newly minted president-elect took the stage with at least 40 of his closest aides and allies, but according to a high-level campaign source familiar with Trump s thinking, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie kept pushing to be near the president-elect and  trying to get in shots. Trump got annoyed,  the source told Yahoo News.The election night photo incident was one of several factors Trump insiders cited to explain why Christie was demoted from his position as transition team chair and replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Nov. 11.In addition to the three Trump campaign sources who spoke to Yahoo News, two junior staffers also described specific instances of alleged mismanagement by Christie that got the transition off to a slow start. The two staffers said Christie did alarmingly little work on the transition and was largely absent from the campaign during the weeks leading up to the election, when Trump was widely expected to lose. According to one account, campaign staffers had been so accustomed to Christie s absence that they were surprised to see him appear at campaign headquarters in Trump Tower   on Election Day.

"Nov 21, 2017","Brooklyn College is advising New York City police officers to use bathrooms on the far end of campus in order to avoid being seen by students who might be offended by their presence.The Excelsior, the college s student newspaper, reported last week that Director of Public Safety Donald Wenz would  prefer  if members of the New York Police Department (NYPD) used facilities in the West End Building (WEB)  rather than walking across either quad to use the bathroom. Wenz s comments come in the wake of a film screening of the movie  Watched,  which documents an NYPD informant who surveilled Muslim students on campus for a period of four years as part of the city s counterterrorism efforts. After the screening, students were allowed to share their thoughts on having NYPD officers on campus. I disagree with them being on campus. Especially allowing them to use the building where student groups are held,  one unidentified student remarked, according to The Excelsior, later noting that he would be sending a petition to College President Michelle Anderson, pressuring her to issue a statement  that we do not want the NYPD on campus in any respect even if it s just to take breaks and use bathrooms. After discovering The Excelsior s report, The New York Post took a trip to the WEB, where officers are now encouraged to use the bathroom, and found an  out of order  sign on the stall door, with a dirty and broken toilet on the inside. The bathroom is horrendous. You can only wash your hands in one of the sinks because the other two are broken,  one student told the Post, though others argued that NYPD should not be allowed on campus at all. I know students from every background and across every major. They don t feel comfortable around cops. They just don t. It makes safe spaces feel not so safe,  one unidentified student remarked, with another telling the Post that it s  weird  seeing cops on campus.But members of the NYPD who monitor the neighborhood surrounding the school told the Post that the student sentiments are  insane.

He then sprints across the border before hitting the ground in critical condition but alive.The four soldiers unloaded an estimated 40 rounds from multiple types of firearms.The defector a 24-year-old soldier surnamed Oh, according to CNN was taken to a South Korean hospital in critical condition from the gunshot wounds and lost nearly half of his blood. Oh s surgeon, Lee Cook-jong, said that he found four major wounds on the soldier, who received four pints of blood.The soldier underwent multiple surgeries to repair damage, and in doing so, surgeons found dozens of parasites including a 10.6-inch roundworm, possibly indicating improper nutrition in North Korea s military.

"Nov 23, 2015","Congresswoman Gabbard also criticizes Hillary s strategy. Is it possible we re hearing a Democrat who s actually making sense? Hmmm .this is gonna leave a mark Last month, US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard went on CNN and laid bare Washington s Syria strategy.In a remarkably candid interview with Wolf Blitzer, Gabbard calls Washington s effort to oust Assad  counterproductive  and  illegal  before taking it a step further and accusing the CIA of arming the very same terrorists who The White House insists are  sworn enemies. In short, Gabbard all but tells the American public that the government is lying to them and may end up inadvertently starting  World War III. For those who missed it, here s the clip:https://youtu.be/IHkher6ceaAThat was before Paris.Well, in the wake of the attacks, Gabbard has apparently had just about enough of Washington vacillating in the fight against terror just so the US can ensure that ISIS continues to destabilize Assad and now, with bi-partisan support, the brazen Hawaii Democrat has introduced legislation to end the  illegal war  to overthrow Assad.Gabbard, who fought in Iraq   twice   has partnered with Republican Adam Scott on the bill. Here s AP:In an unusual alliance, a House Democrat and Republican have teamed up to urge the Obama administration to stop trying to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad and focus all its efforts on destroying Islamic State militants.Reps. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat, and Austin Scott, a Republican, introduced legislation on Friday to end what they called an  illegal war  to overthrow Assad, the leader of Syria accused of killing tens of thousands of Syrian citizens in a more than four-year-old civil war entangled in a battle against IS extremists, also known as ISIS. The U.S. is waging two wars in Syria,  Gabbard said.  The first is the war against ISIS and other Islamic extremists, which Congress authorized after the terrorist attack on 9/11. The second war is the illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad. Scott said,  Working to remove Assad at this stage is counter-productive to what I believe our primary mission should be. Since 2013, the CIA has trained an estimated 10,000 fighters, although the number still fighting with so-called moderate forces is unclear. CIA-backed rebels in Syria, who had begun to put serious pressure on Assad s forces, are now under Russian bombardment with little prospect of rescue by their American patrons, U.S. officials say.For years, the CIA effort had foundered   so much so that over the summer, some in Congress proposed cutting its budget. Some CIA-supported rebels had been captured; others had defected to extremist groups.Gabbard complained that Congress has never authorized the CIA effort, though covert programs do not require congressional approval, and the program has been briefed to the intelligence committees as required by law, according to congressional aides who are not authorized to be quoted discussing the matter.Gabbard contends the effort to overthrow Assad is counter-productive because it is helping IS topple the Syrian leader and take control of all of Syria. If IS were able to seize the Syrian military s weaponry, infrastructure and hardware, the group would become even more dangerous than it is now and exacerbate the refugee crisis. And make no mistake, Tulsi s understanding of Washington s absurd Mid-East policy goes far beyond Syria. That is, Gabbard fully grasps the big picture as well. Here s what she has to say about the idea that the US should everywhere and always attempt to overthrow regimes when human rights groups claim there s evidence of oppression: People said the very same thing about Saddam (Hussein), the very same thing about (Moammar) Gadhafi, the results of those two failed efforts of regime change and the following nation-building have been absolute, not only have they been failures, but they ve actually worked to strengthen our enemy.  Somebody get Langley on the phone, this woman must be stopped.Here s Gabbard speaking to CNN this week about Assad: So there s hope for the US public after all.Perhaps if the clueless masses won t listen to  lunatic  fringe blogs or Sergei Lavrov, they ll listen to a US Congresswoman who served two tours of duty in Iraq and who is now telling Americans that The White House, The Pentagon, and most especially the CIA are together engaged in an  illegal  effort to overthrow the government of a sovereign country and in the process are arming the very same extremists that are attacking civilians in places like Paris.Good luck Tulsi, and thanks for proving that there s at least one person inside that Beltway that isn t either dishonest or naive.Via: Zero HedgeFrom Gabbard Here are 10 reasons the U.S. must end its war to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad:Because if we succeed in overthrowing the Syrian government of Assad, it will open the door for ISIS, al-Qaeda, and other Islamic extremists to take over all of Syria. There will be genocide and suffering on a scale beyond our imagination. These Islamic extremists will take over all the weaponry, infrastructure, and military hardware of the Syrian army and be more dangerous than ever before. We should not be allying ourselves with these Islamic extremists by helping them achieve their goal because it is against the security interests of the United States and all of civilization. Because the money and weapons the CIA is providing to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad are going directly or indirectly into the hands of the Islamic extremist groups, including al-Qaeda affiliates, al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, and others who are the actual enemies of the United States. These groups make up close to 90 percent of the so-called opposition forces, and are the most dominant fighters on the ground. Because our efforts to overthrow Assad has increased and will continue to increase the strength of ISIS and other Islamic extremists, thus making them a bigger regional and global threat. Because this war has exacerbated the chaos and carnage in Syria and, along with the terror inflicted by ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups fighting to take over Syria, continues to increase the number of Syrians forced to flee their country. Because we should learn from our past mistakes in Iraq and Libya that U.S. wars to overthrow secular dictators (Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi) cause even more chaos and human suffering and open the door for Islamic extremists to take over in those countries. Because the U.S. has no credible government or government leader ready to bring order, security, and freedom to the people of Syria. Because even the  best case  scenario that the U.S. successfully overthrows the Syrian government of Assad would obligate the United States to spend trillions of dollars and the lives of American service members in the futile effort to create a new Syria. This is what we have been trying to do in Iraq for twelve years, and we still have not succeeded. The situation in Syria will be much more difficult than in Iraq. Because our war against the Syrian government of Assad is interfering with our being one-pointedly focused on the war to defeat ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and the other Islamic extremists who are our actual enemy. Because our war to overthrow the Assad government puts us in direct conflict with Russia and increases the likelihood of war between the United States and Russia and the possibility of another world war.

"Nov 23, 2017","On this Thanksgiving, I would like to address an open letter to the multimillionaire National Football League players who continue to take a knee when  The Star-Spangled Banner  is played.Dear kneeling brothers,As a proud Army veteran, mom and black American, I thank God that I live in the greatest nation on Earth. For me, Thanksgiving doesn t just come once a year. I m thankful 365 days a year.You make far, far more money than almost all Americans   regardless of race. Kids look up to you as heroes. You appear on TV and in the media.Yet, you keep on protesting   refusing to rise and respect our national anthem and respect the men and women like me who serve or have served in our military.I was willing to die for my country when I put on the Army uniform. And you re not even willing to stand up for a short song? This is too much of a sacrifice for you?One of the many lessons I ve learned along the way is that there is no place on the planet like America. She is not perfect, because we are not perfect. Yet, she is a consummate beacon of light, set upon a hill, for nations who look to her for hope, dignity and direction.You big guys should appreciate that   and pause for a few moments to express your patriotism and love for our great nation when our national anthem is played and our flag flies before thousands of people who have paid good money to see you run around a field chasing a little ball.Let me tell you about me. I m not as big and strong as you, but I stepped forward to join the Army to fight for your right to play games in peace.Weeks before I graduated from the Army s basic training program, I had an epiphany: I could be deployed to war. Would I go? Would I put my life on the line for someone else?It didn t take me long to come to a resounding Yes! If called, I would go.But I gave myself an assignment. If I was going to potentially give life or limb to defend this great country, I would need to know what, exactly, I was defending. I am still learning.One of the lessons I ve learned about America is more of a personal lesson. I am not a victim. My two beautiful black babies are not victims. Black Americans are not victims.We are victors   not so much because of anything we have done, but because of those who came before us. Slaves in chains, treated like farm animals, to be  owned  by others. And after Emancipation, those who endured the humiliation of drinking out of the  dirty  water fountain or taking their child into the  colored  restroom.Those who were spat upon or cursed out solely because they were deemed the  wrong  color. Those who had to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar to be eligible to vote, notwithstanding their college education.Those who were hosed down, billy-clubbed across the head or attacked by trained dogs just because they walked across a bridge.Those who were aroused from their sleep to see hate-filled men covered in white sheets, a cross burning in their front yard and their neighbor calling out for their son.Those who, oftentimes, paid the ultimate sacrifice   not for their own benefit, but for the joy that was set before them.We, today, are the joy that was set before them. And, how do you repay them for their sacrifice to be treated as equal under the law? You have chosen to take a knee.If you followed the rhetoric we hear today, America is not far removed from those Jim Crow days of legalized discrimination against black people.If you closed your eyes and just listened to the blistering speeches coming from Antifa, the Black Lives Matter folks and many politicians, you would think we re not even 40 years removed from slavery itself.The narrative behind  Hands Up, Don t Shoot  perpetuates the storyline that around every street corner there s a police officer waiting to shoot a black man. It is these narratives that have given life to you NFL players kneeling during our national anthem.If there was truth behind these narratives, then I would readily support you black millionaire athletes using your national platform to shine a bright light on the systemic racism against the black community.But we re not living in 1850 or 1950. Racism is certainly not dead, but it s not the powerful monster backed by all the resources of government either. And you guys are not exactly downtrodden, going hungry, being shoved to the back of the bus, or used for target practice by Ku Klux Klansmen dressed up like cops.Allow me to make a few suggestions to you as an alternative to continuing to disrespect our country and flag. If you want to make a real difference that extends beyond getting your picture on a magazine cover, please consider doing the following.First, invest in black urban schools, to help them pay for the educational programs and enhanced learning opportunities that wealthy suburban schools have to help their students succeed.Second, commit to providing mentoring and college scholarships for 20, 10 or even just one child in the inner city, from elementary school through high school and into college. You will change their futures.Third, take $1 million or $2 million   not all of your vast wealth   and invest it into creating jobs, businesses and entrepreneurial internships to help black people achieve the American Dream. Find ways to personally take your millions directly into a distressed community and invest.Fourth, take a family out of the inner city by giving them a mortgage-free home. Consider the ripple effect of good this stand would have on the lives of an entire family for generations to come.Fifth, educate yourselves and then others on what the Democratic Party has done to the black community. I have yet to find an inner city run by conservatives. Yet I see one Democratic politician after another representing some of the most distressed communities. These politicians themselves usually do not live in those distressed communities and often live in expensive homes while their kids attend private schools.Teach yourselves and others to hold elected officials accountable. Be determined to no longer fall prey to their sleight-of-hand manipulations that only serve to distract you from their lack of effort to make real changes in the black community.Doing just one of these things would make an indelible imprint on any community, especially the black community.So instead of taking a knee, take a stand to stomp out poverty by investing in businesses, by creating an environment that promotes family stability, and by fanning the flames of hope, dignity and direction into the lives of some of our most depressed citizens.By the grace of God, I was never called into war during my Army service. I know many others who were. Some did not return whole. So, while I can t play pro football, I have two legs, two arms and a brain that tells me to appreciate and love the United States of America.For all this I am thankful, and I think you should be too.Happy Thanksgiving,Kathy Barnette",ARMY VETERAN’S Incredible Thanksgiving Smack Down Of Spoiled Brat NFL Anthem Kneelers Goes Viral

These residents of Chicago understand that Obama has done nothing to help raise them out of a state of dependency. They want jobs. They want self-esteem. They want to raise their families and earn a paycheck. Obama and the Democrats want to keep them down. And when the joblessness is so out of control, and the youth living in these impoverished neighborhoods get out of control, the cops are called in. Obama and Eric Holder have managed to turn the same cops who are coming into these neighborhoods and risking their lives into Public Enemy #1. Obama has these residents living in a perpetual hell-hole with no way out. No wonder they re so damn angry. Someone needs to get the message out to these communities that the Democrat party has no interest in helping them to break this cycle. The Black community needs jobs. We want them, we need them and it is a matter of life and death for us. The liberal agenda is not the black agenda, it is not the family agenda and it s not the American agenda.

The 58-year-old former Smiths frontman said in an interview with der Spiegel this week that if he were presented with a button that could instantly kill Trump, he wouldn t hesitate to press it. I would [push it], for the safety of humanity,  Morrissey told the outlet.  It has nothing to do with my personal opinion of his face or his family, but in the interest of humanity I would push. The singer also explained that it was the media, who so derided Trump during the 2016 campaign season, that ultimately created Trump, ensured consistent coverage of his campaign, and led to his victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.The American media helped Trump, yes, they first created it,  he explained, according to a translation of the interview by the Washington Times.  Whether they criticize him or laugh at him, he does not care, he just wants to see his picture and his name. The American media have shot themselves in the leg. Watch Morrissey push for a Hillary presidency on Larry King Now prior to the election. Is there anything more heartwarming than watching a British musician tell an American host who Americans should vote for? Thank goodness no one listens to this unhinged overrated celebrity.Morrissey added that he  never expected  Trump to be elected president and has  no faith  in the political establishment anymore.

"Nov 27, 2015","UPDATE: No #BlackLivesMatter Protests PlannedChicago has no shortage of thugs. What they do have a shortage of is support from the #BlackLivesMatter terrorists and Obama Regime. You don t hear our Community Organizer In Chief running to a microphone every time a young black man or woman is murdered at the hands of another black man or woman. Sadly, it doesn t fit their narrative. This young boy s murder is far more tragic than the plight of the Muslim boy, with a history of discipline issues, who took a fake bomb to school in Texas on 9-11 and was rightly punished for his behavior by school officials. The phony outrage that Obama showed the world over this little fake  clock boy s  arrest should sicken every American. It is especially disturbing when one considers Obama s deafening silence over the horrific gang violence that plagues his hometown of Chicago. Where were the tweets of outrage from the White House over the loss of this beautiful young boy s life? Crickets On Friday, prosecutors laid out their case against a man accused of murdering 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee on Nov. 2Corey Morgan, 27, of suburban Lansing, was charged in the murder. Police have one other man in custody who has not yet been charged, and a third man, Kevin Edwards, is also wanted in the slaying.Prosecutors say Corey Morgan (left) and Kevin Edwards planned the heinous murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee.Assistant State s Attorney George Canellis said Friday the shooting stemmed from an ongoing feud between Morgan s gang, the BBG (Bang Bang Gang)/Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones and the Killaward faction of the Gangster Disciples.The feud came to a boil after an Oct. 13 shooting in which Morgan s brother, Tracey Morgan was killed and his mother was wounded. Morgan was so enraged he threatened to shoot  grandmas, mamas, kids and all  in retaliation, prosecutors said.Tyshawn was hit in his back, forearm and head, and part of his thumb was shot off as if he was raising his hand to block the shots, Canellis said. This murder was committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner,  Canellis said.Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy vowed to destroy the group responsible for the boy s brutal murder. They are going to be obliterated,  he said.  That gang just signed its death warrant. McCarthy did not detail each suspect s role in the shooting. We know that there were three individuals involved in this,  he said.Morgan s arrest comes nearly a month after Tyshawn s Nov. 2 shooting death.Police are hunting for Kevin Edwards, also suspected in the shooting.Court documents paint a disturbing picture of the planned attack, explaining that Morgan and his accomplices allegedly saw Tyshawn playing on the swings in a playlot with his basketball beside him. One of the suspects allegedly started dribbling Tyshawn s ball, ultimately luring him into the alley where police say he was  executed.

"Nov 28, 2015","This is not a war we can expect our children to fight on their own. We are in a war with a leftist academia who has lost sight of why we are paying for our children to attend their schools. We are not paying for our children to sit in a classroom and talk about the evils of capitalism, the plight of the trans-sexual, the injustices of the minority student who is apparently no better off today than the slaves of the 18th century in America. We are not paying for teachers to convince our children that success should be punished or that choosing a heterosexual, monogamous relationship is selfish and short-sighted. We are paying them to give our children a quality education period. And that is what our children deserve How radical, weird and out of touch have liberals on college campuses gotten since Obama came into office? It s worse than you ever thought and although there is an almost unlimited number of problematic incidents to choose from, these 15 are particularly effective at getting across how bad things have become.1)  College Students Say Remembering 9/11 Is Offensive to Muslims.  The everything-is-offensive brand of campus activism has struck a new low: Students at the University of Minnesota killed a proposed moment of silence for 9/11 victims due to concerns insulting, childish concerns that Muslim students would be offended. 2)  Portland State University Offers Course Teaching How to  Make Whiteness Strange According to Portland State University Professor Rachel Sanders   White Privilege  course,  whiteness  must be dismantled if racial justice will ever be achieved. The course description states that  whiteness is the lynchpin of structures of racial meaning and racial inequality in the United States  and claims that  to preserve whiteness is to preserve racial injustice.  Students taking the course will  endeavor to make whiteness strange.  In order to make whiteness strange, the description says students must  interrogate whiteness as an unstable legal, political, social, and cultural construction. 3)  A University in the San Francisco Area Actually Told Students To Call 911 if They Were Offended .Administrators at a Catholic university in the San Francisco Bay Area have rescinded an official school policy instructing students to clog up the regional 9-1-1 emergency reporting system to report  bias incidents. The school is Santa Clara University, reports Campus Reform Until this month, however, Santa Clara administrators have been instructing students to report  bias incidents  using the emergency service reserved for dispatching police, firefighters and ambulances. If the bias incident is in progress or just occurred: ALWAYS CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY,  the Santa Clara website instructed students in fierce, all-capital letters. Mizzou Police Sent a Campus Wide Email to students during protests: CALL POLICE if someone says something hurtful to you4)  Educators in the Volunteer State are very concerned that students might be offended by the usage of traditional pronouns like she, he, him and hers, according to a document from the University of Tennessee   Knoxville s Office of Diversity and Inclusion. For all you folks who went to school back when there were only him and her   here s a primer: some of the new gender neutral pronouns are ze, hir, zir, xe, xem and xyr. 5)  A Professor at Polk State College has allegedly failed a humanities student after she refused to concede that Jesus is a  myth  or that Christianity oppresses women during a series of mandatory assignments at the Florida college. According to a press release from the Liberty Counsel, a non-profit public interest law firm, Humanities Professor Lance  Lj  Russum gave a student a  zero  on four separate papers because the 16-year-old did not  conform to his personal worldviews of Marxism, Atheism, Feminism, and homosexuality.  The law firm has called for a full, private investigation of the professor and the course curriculum. 6)  College Codes Make  Color Blindness  a Microaggression wait, what? . UCLA says  Color Blindness,  the idea we shouldn t obsess over people s race, is a microaggression. If you refuse to treat an individual as a  racial/cultural being,  then you re being aggressive. 7)  The phrase  politically correct  is now a microaggression according to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The university s  Just Words  campaign is the work of UWM s  Inclusive Excellence Center  and aims to  raise awareness of microaggressions and their impact microaggressions like  politically correct  or  PC. 8) )  American,   illegal alien,   foreigners,   mothering,  and  fathering  are just a handful of words deemed  problematic  by the University of New Hampshire s Bias-Free Language Guide .Saying  American  to reference Americans is also problematic. The guide encourages the use of the more inclusive substitutes  U.S. citizen  or  Resident of the U.S.  The guide also tries to get students to stop saying  Caucasian,   illegal Immigrant,   mother,   father  and even the word  healthy  is said to shame those who aren t healthy. 9)  Late yesterday afternoon, ACLJ filed a lawsuit on behalf of Brandon Jenkins against officials of The Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) in Maryland for denying Brandon admission to its Radiation Therapy Program in part due to his expression of religious beliefs. As one faculty member explained to Brandon, on behalf of CCBC, the  field [of radiation therapy] is not the place for religion. 10)  A California school co-founded by a firebrand who once called for an  intifada  in the U.S. has become the nation s first accredited Muslim college. 11)  According to Coastal Carolina University, sex is only consensual if both parties are completely sober and if consent is not only present, but also enthusiastic. This is a troubling standard that converts many ordinary, lawful sexual encounters into sexual assault, and it should frighten any student at CCU. 12)  Clemson University apologizes for serving Mexican food Students took to Twitter to call the event culturally insensitive and to question the school s efforts to promote diversity .Clemson Dining issued an apology to  offended  students after hosting a  Maximum Mexican  food day. 13)  All-Women s College Cancels  Vagina Monologues  Because it Excludes Women Without Vaginas. 14)  The  Black Lives Matter  leader who landed a teaching gig at Yale University delivered a lecture this week on the historical merits of looting as a form of protest, backing up his lesson with required reading that puts modern-day marauders on par with the patriots behind the Boston Tea Party. 15)  Assistant Dean (at Cornell) Tells a Project Veritas Investigative Journalist that the University Would Allow an ISIS Terrorist to Hold a  Training Camp  on Campus, Saying:  It Would be Like Bringing in a Coach to do a Training on a Sports Team.'

"Nov 28, 2017","According to WIRED   THERE ARE HACKABLE security flaws in software. And then there are those that don t even require hacking at all just a knock on the door and asking to be let in. Apple s macOS High Sierra has the second kind.On Tuesday, security researchers disclosed a bug that allows anyone a blindingly easy method of breaking that operating system s security protections. Anyone who hits a prompt in High Sierra asking for a username and password before logging into a machine with multiple users, they can simply type  root  as a username, leave the password field blank, click  unlock  twice, and immediately gain full access.In other words, the bug allows any rogue user that gets the slightest foothold on a target computer to gain the deepest level of access to a computer, known as  root  privileges. Malware designed to exploit the trick could also fully install itself deep within the computer, no password required. We always see malware trying to escalate privileges and get root access,  says Patrick Wardle, a security researcher with Synack.  This is best, easiest way ever to get root, and Apple has handed it to them on a silver platter. As word of the security vulnerability rippled across Twitter and other social media, a few security researchers found they couldn t replicate the issue, but others captured and posted video demonstrations of the attack, like Wardle s GIF below, and another that shows security researcher Amit Serper logging into a logged-out account. WIRED also independently confirmed the bug.Watch these two incredible videos posted to Twitter letting Apple know they have a  HUGE  security issue at MacOS High Sierra:  pic.twitter.com/4TBh5NetIS  patrick wardle (@patrickwardle) November 28, 2017Just tested the apple root login bug. You can log in as root even after the machi was rebooted pic.twitter.com/fTHZ7nkcUp  Amit Serper (@0xAmit) November 28, 2017The fact that the attack could be used on a logged-out account raises the possibility that someone with physical access could exploit it just as easily as malware, points out Thomas Reed, an Apple-focused security researcher with MalwareBytes. They could, for instance, use the attack to gain root access to a logged-out machine, set a root password, and then regain access to a machine at any time.  Oooh, boy, this is a doozy,  says Reed.  So, if someone did this to a Mac sitting on a desk in an office, they could come back later and do whatever they wanted. Facebook user Brian Matiash tells Mac users about how they protect their Mac from being hacked. We cannot confirm or deny if his advice is legit, we are simply sharing it with you. Matiash gives Facebook users the following advice: Wonders never cease, Apple. How can such a painfully obvious bug like this make it by your QA teams? At least make the default root password be  password  or something. FFS, guys. Get you damned act together. EDIT: It would be socially responsible of me to state that there is a fairly easy workaround.

This video of Detroit City Council member Monica Conyers (D), wife of US Representative John Conyers helps to explain the type of character Detroit voters have been placing their trust in for decades. This is an older video, but definitely worth sharing.Shortly after this debate with an 8th grader, City Councilwoman Monica Conyers was found guilty of bribery and sent to prison for 3 years.Former Detroit City councilwoman, Monica Conyers was sentenced to more than three years in prison for bribery after a federal judge refused to set aside her guilty plea during a stormy court hearing dominated by a dispute over evidence of other payoffs.As guards cleared the packed courtroom, Monica Conyers yelled that she planned to appeal. The wife of U.S. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., wanted to withdraw her guilty plea, suggesting she was the victim of  badgering  last year when she admitted taking cash to support a Houston company s sludge contract with the city.But U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn, reviewing a transcript of the June hearing, said Conyers had denied any coercion and voluntarily pleaded guilty to conspiracy.Conyers, 45, is the biggest catch so far in the FBI s wide-ranging investigation of corruption in Detroit city government. Nine people have pleaded guilty, including two former directors of the downtown convention center, and prosecutors have promised more charges are coming. Bribery is a betrayal of trust,  Cohn told Conyers after announcing a 37-month prison term for her  egregious  crime. She quit the council after pleading guilty in June.Conyers  plea deal was limited to taking bribes to support a contract with Synagro worth $47 million a year. But the recent trial of her former aide, Sam Riddle, exposed a series of alleged schemes involving others making payoffs to do business at city hall.Prosecutors said Riddle and Conyers collected $69,500 by shaking people down and urged Cohn to consider the alleged crimes when sentencing her. Defense lawyer Steve Fishman firmly objected and demanded a separate hearing.Conyers declared,  I m not going to jail for something I didn t do. Before the hearing, Conyers moved around the courtroom like a playful host, blowing kisses to supporters while wearing dark sunglasses. Her husband, who has an office in the federal courthouse, was not in the courtroom. Spokesman Jonathan Godfrey said he didn t know his whereabouts. Via: Huff PostDespite her going to prison, losing her political job and often embarrassing the family with her behavior in City Hall, U.S. Rep.

"Nov 3, 2016","The National Archives inspector general investigated the theft. Later emails released by the State Department do not indicate if the federal government ever found the hard drive.There s also the separate case of Sandy Berger who literally stuck documents in his clothes and left the National Archives with them. He was later found cutting the documents up with scissors! It s understood that he wanted to destroy any papers with writing/notes written in the margins. He was the National Security advisor for the Clinton administration and it appears he was a good and loyal soldier to the Clintons when he destroyed evidence These two case of stolen documents have not been solved and we feel it s yet another case of a Clinton coverup A newly released email from the State Department shows that Hillary Clinton was informed in April 2009 of a massive theft of data pertaining to former President Bill Clinton s White House records.On April 13, 2009, Clinton attorney Cheryl Mills informed newly sworn-in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton via email that the National Archives could not account for a two-terabyte hard drive. The drive may contain a wide range of memos, emails, and other electronic documents from the Clinton White House.  The hard drive contained information from the administration of her husband, former President Bill Clinton.The email was made public from State Department files on Thursday as part of an ongoing release of recovered emails that had been previously deleted from Clinton s private server.The forwarded email said the National Archives had a duplicate and was examining it to know what was stolen. It was stolen or misplaced between Jan. 30, 2009, and March 24, 2009.The possible data losses were all serious but only three documents were classified. Social Security numbers and dates of births may have been lost to thieves. Political information may have been stolen too. Two terabytes is a very very large amount of data; the drive may contain a wide range of memos, emails, and other electronic documents from the Clinton White House,  wrote Blake Roberts, deputy associate White House counsel for President Barack Obama.  All the material is unclassified, except for three documents which Bill Leary has examined and does not believe present any significant risk. But the loss was still serious. Based on its analysis, NARA (National Archives) believes the drive contains other sensitive material, including: There is at least a 50% likelihood that the personal information (including DOB and SSN) of all individuals placed through the Clinton Presidential Personnel Office was on the lost hard drive,  wrote Roberts.  There is a 90% likelihood that the personal information (including DOB and SSN) of all Clinton WH staff was on the lost hard drive. There is a 100% chance that some of it was on the lost hard drive. The three classified documents were authored by Lael Brainard, then a top nominee for the Department of the Treasury, Roberts wrote. There are almost certainly records from many other White House officials,  he said.The National Archives inspector general investigated the theft. Later emails released by the State Department do not indicate if the federal government ever found the hard drive. The federal government said they would notify affected people of the breach.The National Archives later did issue a press release on July 16, 2009, updating the public on the search for the hard drive. It offered a reward of $50,000. It also said 15,750 individuals had to be notified by mail of the possible theft.It s not clear why the hard drive was stolen eight years after Bill Clinton left office, and at the start of a new Democratic administration that included his wife, Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state.Theft of records from the National Archives had happened before.The late Sandy Berger, Bill Clinton s national security adviser from 1997 to 2001, removed several documents from the National Archives between Sept. 2, 2003, and Oct. 2, 2003.Berger removed the classified documents from the National Archives by sneaking them out in his socks and pants. Berger then stored and retained such documents at his place of employment. He pleaded guilty in 2005 but received no prison time, according to CNN.",NATIONAL ARCHIVES MISSING Massive Data From Clinton White House Records
"Nov 3, 2017","One courageous Navy vet has had enough of the disrespectful NFL players who kneel during the national anthem. Although it would be a great honor for the vet to receive an award, he put standing up for and defending our flag before being recognized for his service. Good for him A disabled Navy veteran said he declined to accept an award at a New Orleans Saints game due to the controversy over players protesting during the national anthem.The Saints organization was going to honor retired Cmdr. John Wells, the executive director of Military Veterans Advocacy, with the Peoples Health Champion award during last week s game in New Orleans, according to The Advocate.On Wednesday he told the organization he was unable to accept the award at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome because of the anthem protests. Saints players have been seen kneeling before the anthem and some continue to do so during the national anthem. Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players  disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation,  Wells said.  I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails. Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it. Wells served in the Navy from 1972 to 1994 and afterward became an attorney concentrating in military and veterans law, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. He was set to receive the award given by Medicare to senior citizens who have made significant accomplishments.The Saints said in a statement Thursday that they were disappointed by Wells  decision.

"Nov 30, 2015","So the irony isn t lost on me when I saw the still shot of Hillary wearing the Muslim symbol of submission to men in her new ad. This woman wants to be seen as strong and knowledgeable on foreign policy but obviously doesn t understand the message she s sending out. Does Hillary Clinton not know what wearing a hijab means or is she just that stupid to throw one on for votes? It s like when she puts on the phony Southern accent when she s in South Carolina. Pandering to the Muslims and those that think it s just so great that she s so diverse tells us all we need to know about this hag. She d do anything to get elected even wear a symbol of oppression how ironic! Daniel Greenfield gives us the lowdown on the symbolism of wearing a hijab:Hillary s latest campaign video tries to build up her non-existent foreign policy experience. That means making as much as possible out of her feminist speech in China  which avoided criticizing a Communist regime that forces women to have abortions. (Or as her Planned Parenthood pals call it, health care outreach.) And showing her travel photo slideshow.It s basically like those travel videos friends force you to watch  except this is a really expensive commercial and no one can force you to watch it.But in odd contrast to touting Hillary s feminism and strength, is this shot of her wearing a Hijab; an Islamic garment of submission.Not only has the Hijab consistently been a source of Muslim violence against women, both in punishing women who don t wear it and punishing women who take it off, but its origins lie in an Islamic commandment distinguishing Muslim women, who couldn t be raped, from non-Muslim slave women captured by Mohammed s rampaging gang.It s really quite explicit.The Koranic verse that mandates covering states,  O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks all over their bodies that they may thus be distinguished and not molested  (Koran 33:59)That s not modesty. The covering is being worn to avoid rape.The key words here are  distinguished and not molested . Whom are these women being distinguished from? Women who don t cover up and can be molested.Hillary s  cloak  is incomplete by Saudi or Taliban standards, but all these coverings are meant to be a symbolic form of Purdah, the physical confinement of a woman, even within her home.In her commercial, Hillary Clinton, by wearing the Hijab, is advertising that she is the property of a man and therefore  not to be molested . Of course since Islamic law doesn t recognize the marriages of non-Muslim peoples it is at war with, enabling Jihadis to sexually assault even married non-Muslim women, as the Islamic prophet Mohammed allowed his Muslim followers to do, it s also a meaningless gesture.Is it really a feminist gesture to voluntarily accept the Islamic distinction between women who can be assaulted and women who can t?Either way it s certainly a step back for a female politician who wants to be seen as a leader and a fighter for women.Via: Front Page Magazine",Hillary’s Latest Ad Pushes Muslim Agenda Of Submission To Men

It s being reported that hundreds of work orders have been made to fix numerous problems. If anyone can fix the White House up to be the best it can be, it s President Trump. He s a builder and a perfectionist so it s no surprise that he reportedly said the White House is a  dump . He s use to 5-star places so we re betting he ll have the White House in 5-star shape AND under budget in no time .MAGA!Apparently, the White House really is a dump   with work orders showing reports of mice and cockroach infestations in the West Wing, broken toilet seats in the Oval Office and numerous other problems.The documents, obtained by NBC4 Washington, were made public this week just months after President Trump reportedly criticized the shape that it was left in by the previous administration. That White House is a real dump,  he said, according to Golf magazine.While the president later denied the comment, it turns out, there really are loads of issues plaguing the historic structure.White House officials made hundreds of requests for repairs, equipment and pest control in 2017 with the US General Services Administration   many of which were similar to those made in 2016 during Barack Obama s final year in office, NBC4 reports.The work orders were similar in number and included reports of mice, cockroaches and even ants!Some orders listed simple projects such as broken doors and chairs, while others detailed requests for TV systems and new decor. It s an enormous job. GSA is assigned to manage that job,  explained former GSA Inspector General Brian Miller.Some of the work that needs to be done inside the White House listed a mid-April deadline, though it s unclear if this was actually met. It s also not known if any of the aforementioned issues were ever fixed or dealt with. They are old buildings,  Miller said of the grounds at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

He even offers to arrange a friendly interview for Hillary with Megyn. Here is the text from the email:Dear Jen,I know what I m about to propose is very risky and will be instinctively viewed negatively on the first reaction. But because of the high advantages that I see, perfectly aware of the risks, I think this proposal should be considered.I propose that the Secretary be on the Megyn Kelly File show for at least 30 minutes. I believe I can reduce the risks, since I know Megyn and Roger Ailes very well, by ensuring that the Secretary will have an opportunity to answer tough questions on emails and other issues without interruption. In fact, I believe it is in the interest of Secretary Clinton as well as Fox for the questions to be tough, something we should not fear as long as she has an opportunity to answer. I know she will do well with adequate preparation, and especially after yesterday s excellent statement taking full responsibility for mixing personal an official business on a single email device.I still believe the issue of the wiping out of the private server still needs to be dealt with   e.g., simply stating that was done primarily to protect personal privacy on personal emails but she made the mistake of mixing personal with official on the server because she was using a single device, and she should have been more transparent shortly after she left office. This interview has the potential to be a ratings and media bonanza. I have confidence she would hit a political home run and have a massive audience to deliver her message without a filter. Of course there is a risk that Megan will try to show how tough she can be, even tougher than on Trump. I am assuming the worst case on that risk. But if we have a guarantee, which I believe We will get, that she will have an uninterrupted chance to respond to every question, and we have time to prepare, I think this could be a major plus and even a game changer in the various negative narratives about the Secretary being largely inaccessible and sometimes testy with the media.Here is a screen shot of the original email:",WIKILEAKS EMAIL: CLINTON FAN BOY Says He “Knows” Trump-Hater Megyn Kelly…Offers To Arrange Softball Interview For Hillary

"Nov 6, 2015","So, if the hosts on this show are just  comedians,  does that mean the low information voters who follow them will stop taking these hacks so seriously? Friday on ABC s  The View,  Republican presidential candidate and former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Carly Fiorina fought toe to toe with the co-hosts over their comments disparaging her face as demented  and a  Halloween Mask. After small talk, Whoopi Goldberg brought up the subject saying,  How about humor? I m going the bring it up because there are going to be lots of comics saying lots of things. I wondered, because we saw some of the that you were a little upset with us about a comic comment that was made. And so, how will you steel your skin? How will you get a thicker skin to accept some of the humorous things that will be said about you? Fiorina said,  Well, hey, if you meant your comment about my face being demented and a Halloween mask as humorous, so be it. I guess you misinterpreted Donald Trump s questions. I have a real thick skin. Joy Behar said,  I defended you against Donald Trump s comment. He s running for president of the United States and he was making a nasty comment about your looks. I took him on. On this show, but, we are comedians here. I make fun of Hillary s pantsuits. Hillary s husband s sex life. Rep. John Boehner s tan. Who else? I don t understand why any politician is exempt from my jokes. Here s the clip from Carly s awesome interview:Fiorina answered,  You know what, Joy. You know what, Joy? You can say whatever you want. You always have. You always will. I m not going to stop that. And don t worry, I have skin plenty thick enough to the take whatever people throw at me. I m making a different point. The different point is this. I think that there are real issues in this nation that we ought to be able to discuss in a fact-based, civil fashion. Michelle Collins said,  I want to add that the demented comment was a poor choice of words. It was responding to something you said during the debates. That people were telling you the smile more. To me, it felt like it was not your natural state of mind. It was not on your looks, it was on your expression. It felt like you were being told to smile more. I m wondering, is that difficult for you? Do you have people coaching you to act or be a different way? Will that help you win the election? Fiorina shot back,  First of all, I don t have people coaching me to act a different way or be a different way. There s a time to smile and a time to be serious. When you re talking about burying a child, it s not time to smile. There are serous issues facing the nation. Goldberg said,  We had you here. I thought we were pretty respectful. I have to tell you, having watched some of the press that you have garnered based on this fake feud with  The View,  I m a little taken aback. Because you kind of said that that somehow liberal women are that we re made uncomfortable by conservative women. We were not uncomfortable with you. Did you think we were uncomfortable with you when you were on? Fiorina said,  First of all, Whoopi. I enjoyed being on the show. The first time. and I m enjoying being on the show the second time. And I think  The View  garnered a lot of publicity over the feud as well. I think that s why we re on. Goldberg said,   We haven t put out any ads or anything.

"Nov 6, 2017","The move by a Twitter employee last week to ban President Trump from the social media platform for 11 minutes received a great deal of attention and offered people a glimpse into how easily someone at Twitter can stop the flow of information from a source he does not like.What did not get a great deal of attention, however, was the fact that Twitter s Acting General Counsel, Sean Edgett, admitted in a prepared statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the platform regularly blocked tweets offering information that could paint the Clinton Campaign and DNC in negative lights.Writing for NewsWars, Jerome Corsi notes:At a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Tuesday, Sean Edgett, Acting General Counsel for Twitter, admitted in his prepared testimony that Twitter employed in the 2016 election algorithms that censored out hashtags critical (of) Hillary Clinton, including the hashtag #PodestaEmails and the hashtag #DNCLeaks. Is anyone surprised?Twitter execs long ago began showing their biases against conservatives to such an extent that even USA Today brought it up, noting that Twitter s behind-the-scenes team was quick to ban right-wingers like Milo Yiannopoulos for digs he made at the brilliant and ever-so-entertaining actress Leslie Jones.Yet, conservatives say, nothing happened to rapper Talib Kweli and his followers when they attacked black Breitbart reporter Jerome Hudson with racial slurs. When Breitbart contributor Kassy Dillon complained about a Twitter user who sent her harassing tweets and messages, Twitter made the perpetrator delete one tweet that suggested someone shoot Dillon in the head. Now, the big story that many in the pop media evidently don t want you to see is that Twitter actually admits to having censored tweets that might have spread real information injurious to HRC and the DNC during the 2016 election. The Twits claim that they were simply stopping  spambots  from filling their precious space with tweets from unreal people (one might ask how authentic most politicians seem to be in the first place, but that s a different matter), but hidden in their statements are some  tells  that indicate otherwise.For example, Dr. Corsi observes that in sworn testimony to the Judiciary Committee, Edgett stated:For example, our automated spam detection systems helped mitigate the impact of automated Tweets promoting the #PodestaEmails hashtag, which originated with Wikileaks  publication of thousands of emails from the Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta s Gmail account. The core of the hashtag was propagated by Wikileaks, whose account sent out a series of 118 original Tweets containing variants on the hashtag #PodestaEmails referencing the daily installments of the emails released on the Wikileaks website.So, automatically, what Mr. Edgett has admitted tells us that Twitter intentionally tried to stop the circulation of information offered by an authentic user, Wikileaks, offering authentic information that Wikileaks had published revealing real, confirmed e-mails sourced from John Podesta and the DNC. Those e-mails shed extremely important information about corruption within the DNC that worked against Bernie Sanders  campaign, and in favor of Mrs. Clinton s campaign, and later revealed extremely important information about what Mrs. Clinton knew about the attempted overthrow of Syria and the underlying, unconstitutional reasons for the overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya.Edgett also testified that Twitter hid 25% of the  #PodestaEmails  tweets, andAs described in greater detail below, our systems detected and hid just under half (48%) of the Tweets relating to variants of another notable hashtag, #DNCLeak, which concerned the disclosure of leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee. Those would be the e-mails that revealed towering corruption at the DNC and in many offices of pop media   things like new reporters working with the Clinton campaign to offer her easy questions, things like Donna Brazile, then an employee of CNN, feeding Hillary questions prior to a debate with the electrifying wildman, Bernie Sanders.These are issues that were real, and the more people knew about them, the more they disliked Mrs. Clinton   and the more she and the DNC hackmeisters pushed the spurious  Russia Hack  narrative to deflect from their own malfeasance.For entire story- MRCTV ",HOW CAN ANYONE TRUST THEM?

"Nov 7, 2016","The election is Tuesday. So it s time to make my final case for Donald J. Trump. My case is pretty simple   it s Trump or it s the end of America.I was raised as a middle-class kid in the greatest country in world history. A country built around mobility, opportunity and economic freedom. A country that allowed this son of a butcher to become a successful business owner, media personality, best-selling author and TV star and producer. Only in America.I was taught by my wonderful, patriotic, true red, white and blue, salt-of-the-earth, American parents that certain specific things made America great. Here they are:Faith in God, prayer, love of country, family, a belief in American exceptionalism, capitalism, Judeo-Christian values, the Constitution, limited government, personal responsibility, economic freedom, the military and police. Well don t look now. But everything from that list above   everything we believe in   everything that made America great   has been under full-scale assault for eight long years   from multiple directions. And Hillary is here to finish the job. She already publicly stated she wants to be Obama s third term.The truth is we either send a strong message heard around the world and elect Trump, or the America we know and love is gone. Forever.Because if Trump doesn t win, no other Republican will ever be elected president again. President Hillary Clinton will make sure of that. Hillary will open the borders like never before to let in millions of illegal aliens who have no love for anything that made America great.Foreigners come here not out of a love for America, but for a love of the cradle-to-grave welfare state that America has become. Eighty percent of them (or higher) will vote Democrat forever more to keep the welfare checks coming. That s Hillary s plan.Don t believe me? See California. No Republican will ever again be elected to statewide office. This was the exact formula that destroyed California. Open the borders, let in millions of foreigners, make them dependent on government welfare checks and then train them to vote Democrat to keep the handouts coming.It worked!That was the experiment. Now Democrats are onto Plan B   to turn the rest of America into California.Hillary will open the borders and tie the hands of border agents in order to flood the country with millions of new illegals. Hillary will legalize the 12 million to 15 million or so already here   and give them the right to vote.Hillary will also enthusiastically import millions of Muslim refugees who have no love for America, capitalism, the Constitution, or certainly Judeo-Christian values. Some will become terrorists, almost all will require cradle-to-grave welfare. Then it s over for America.So vote. Drag your friends to the polls. Make phone calls to your entire address book. Leave no stone unturned.Think of the U.S. Supreme Court.Think of open borders.Think of your children s and grandchildren s future.Then vote for Trump like it s   Trump, or the end of America.Because it is.Wayne Allyn Root is a best-selling author and host of  WAR Now: The Wayne Allyn Root Show  3 p.m. to 6 p.m. daily at 790 Talk Now.

Gov. Ralph Northam.Trump, in an unexpected Thursday evening tweet, urged Virginians to vote for Gillespie on Nov. 7, while charging that Northam was soft on gang violence. Gillespie welcomed the president s get-tough-on-crime message, but didn t have much to say about Trump himself.That didn t go unnoticed by one big Trump supporter, John Fredericks, a talk radio host in Southern Virginia who asked Gillespie during a Friday conference call with reporters whether he wanted the president to campaign for him down the stretch.Fredericks told the Washington Examiner in a subsequent interview that Gillespie s hesitance to embrace Trump could cost him on Election Day.

Bush and Laura Bush voted for Hillary Clinton today,  the Washington Examiner reports. On one level, it s personal. Remember what Trump said about Jeb. And Trump has had some unkind things to say about George W. Bush,  Limbaugh explained, referencing Donald Trump s habit during the Republican primary of calling Jeb Bush  low energy. But aside from that, think about party loyalty, think about issues, think about the direction of the country,  Limbaugh added.  How does anybody vote for Hillary Clinton? Limbaugh issued a stern warning to the  elites in Washington and New York,  members of the  club  of powerful, self-interested political and media figures. I submit to you that if you re in the club, and by the club I mean the establishment, if you are among the few elites in Washington and New York that actually, for lack of a better term, run the country, you re going to hang together with other club members,  Limbaugh said.  That s how I think this happens. Hillary Clinton s not seen as a Democrat  She may be, on one intramural level, an opponent, but she s certainly not an enemy when somebody outside the club happens to be running,  Limbaugh continued.

I didn t bring him into the DNC, but I helped keep him there working on voting rights. With all I knew now about the Russians  hacking, I could not help but wonder if they had played some part in his unsolved murder.But Brazile says she had a  spook,  with connections to the intelligence community, who told her after the killing that she needed protection for herself, including cameras, alarms and backup power at her house, and that she heeded his advice.Brazile was so concerned with Rich s death that she used her brief, only phone call from Hillary Clinton after the election loss to bring him up. She asked Clinton to use some of the millions of dollars the campaign had in order to set up a reward fund to find his murderer. But Hillary said she  really had to go. I knew the campaign had over $3 million set aside in a legal fund. Could she help me get this lawsuit started? And don t forget the murder of Seth Rich, I told her. Did she want to contribute to Seth s reward fund? We still hadn t found the person responsible for the tragic murder of this bright young DNC staffer. You re right, she said.

For a Constitutional lawyer, Obama sure does have a difficult time understanding how our laws work President Barack Obama s executive action to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation suffered a legal setback on Monday with an appeal to the Supreme Court now the administration s only option.The 2-1 decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to uphold a May injunction deals a blow to Obama s plan, opposed by Republicans and challenged by 26 states.The Obama administration has said it is within its rights to ask the Department of Homeland Security to use discretion before deporting nonviolent migrants with U.S. family ties.The case has become the focal point of the Democratic president s efforts to change U.S. immigration policy.Seeing no progress on legislative reform in Congress, Obama announced last November he would take executive action to help immigrants. He has faced criticism from Republicans who say the program grants amnesty to lawbreakers.In its ruling, the appeals court said it was denying the government s appeal to stay the May injunction  after determining that the appeal was unlikely to succeed on its merits. Republicans hailed the ruling as a victory against the Obama administration.John Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, said in a Twitter message that the court decision was  a major victory for the rule of law. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement the ruling meant the state, which has led the legal challenge,  has secured an important victory to put a halt to the president s lawlessness.

"Nov 9, 2017","The not so funny comedian Louis C.K. appeared on the Stephen Colbert show mostly to talk about his decision to send an email to his fans, where he told them that  Donald Trump is an insane bigot and Hitler . After the self-righteous  comedian  got some laughs from Colbert s liberal audience, Colbert asked them to settle down, that Louis C.K. admitted that after he sent the email, he  regretted it.   C.K. went on to say that he didn t really regret it, he just regretted  saying it , or in other words, he regrets that he was outed as a whiny, liberal, crybaby who can t control his emotions (our translation). One of the most interesting lines in the interview came after the Trump bashing where the outed sexual predator tells Colbert,  I wouldn t take it back. If you went back and fixed all the mistakes you made, you erase yourself. You know, there s just no point to that.  Good luck trying to  erase yourself  after you ve been outed creep Here s part of Louis C.K. s email to his fans: Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the 30s. Do you think they saw the shit coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.And I m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren t enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time.Trump is not that. He s an insane bigot. He is dangerous.Watch Louis C.K. joke around with Stephen Colbert about his disdain for President Trump, calling him a  Gross crook, dirty, rotten, lying sack of sh*t. The not so funny  comedian  was outed today as a serial sexual predator.NPR reported that Louis C.K. masturbated in front of multiple female colleagues, to their shock and dismay, according to women who spoke on the record to The New York Times about their experiences.The famous comic has been surrounded by rumors of sexual misconduct for years   specifically, allegations that he would masturbate in front of female colleagues.Last year, the comedian Roseanne Barr told The Daily Beast that C.K. was  about to get busted  for his conduct.  It s Louis C.K., locking the door and masturbating in front of women comics and writers. I can t tell you I ve heard so many stories,  she said. Comedian Tig Notaro acknowledged the allegations this summer and said C.K. needed to  handle  them.But previously, those stories were shared secondhand. Now, five women have spoken to the Times directly, with only one requesting anonymity. You can read the full story   which goes into much more detail   over at the New York Times.This Twitter user nailed it when it comes to just how disgusting Louis C.K. really is:Guys like Louis CK could just pay a sex worker. Could even request the sex worker play like she's uncomfortable if they likes. But they don't want that.

"November 1, 2016","What many people have been predicting throughout the course of this election may be starting to come to fruition, but it s still early, so nothing is for certain.What s that prediction? That Republicans help Hillary Clinton win by voting for her over Donald Trump.According to TargetSmart, who is known for their political data, Clinton has an eight point lead in Florida among early voters.BREAKING: @_TargetSmart/@williamandmary FL poll: HRC 48   DJT 40Early voters from FL SoS: 55   38Likely voters, haven't voted yet: 42   43  TargetSmart (@_TargetSmart) November 2, 2016Tom Bonier, TargetSmart CEO, appeared on The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell on MSNBC to share the news of this polling. The most surprising finding being that Clinton has 28% of registered Republican voters voting for her.Bonier said: We see this race as an eight point spread in favor of Secretary Clinton. 48-40. Which really is challenging the conventional wisdom of what we ve seen so far. I will say, in what we re seeing, as been noted on your show and elsewhere on the network, a lot of the vote in Florida has already been cast and elsewhere. As of this morning, over 3.6 million votes have been cast, and so, what s unique about this survey is our ability to actually poll people who have voted and see where they are. There s been a lot of analysis of who s voted by party, but really no sense given of how they re voting.Really what s fueling, honestly, this somewhat surprising eight percent margin for Secretary Clinton is the fact that she s performing incredibly strongly with registered Republican voters. So, what we re seeing in this survey is winning 28% of registered Republicans who have already cast a ballot in Florida. This certainly doesn t look too good for Trump, but it s still early and the election is still a week a way, so who s really to know. BUT it s definitely looking good for Clinton thus far.

"November 1, 2017","On Monday, news broke that Trump s onetime campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had been indicted in connection with Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian interference in our election. Ever since then, everyone s been buzzing about just how dangerous Manafort can be to Trump now. However, we also learned that another Trump associate by the name of George Papadopoulos had been arrested over the summer and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.And Papadopoulos may well be more important to this investigation than Manafort, despite the fact that he isn t that well known. Why? Because contrary to what Sarah H. Sanders tries telling the media, he was a foreign policy adviser on Trump s campaign who did, in fact, try colluding with the Russians. And it s his testimony and documents that could bring Trump s presidency crashing down around him.One official connected to the campaign, and who reportedly witnessed Papadopoulos  efforts to get Trump to meet with Russian officials, says that Trump didn t dismiss the idea of working with Russia when it was brought up. If Papadopoulos can show that s what actually happened, Trump himself will be in a lot of trouble sooner than expected.During his confirmation hearing back in January, Sessions told Senator Al Franken that he wasn t aware of any evidence that anyone colluded with Russia. He later walked that back, but Papadopoulos apparently told various foreign policy committee members about his contact with Russia   a committee which Sessions chaired. Now, Sessions can claim that he opposed the collusion that Papadopoulos was trying to set up, but then he opens himself up to a perjury charge. Either way, he s fucked.It looks like Papadopoulos was meeting with Russians because they claimed to have dirt on Hillary. His contacts go back to before Don Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort met with a Russian attorney who claimed to have dirt on Hillary. (Don Jr. originally lied, saying that the meeting was about reinstating adoptions between us and Russia, but then released his own emails that proved he d lied.)Then the DNC was hacked, and the hack was traced back to Russia. Trump even called on Russia to release Hillary s missing emails during the RNC convention; a comment that has been analyzed again and again with some dismissing it as a joke and others saying it was evidence of something deeper.There s currently no evidence that anything actually came of that June 2016 meeting. However, if Papadopoulos can back up what he said in his plea agreement about the campaign knowing, then it stops being a scandal and becomes active collusion.Manafort and Gates have been charged with things like money laundering, failure to register as foreign agents, etc. The key with these two is whether Mueller can get them to roll over on Trump and other highly placed officials in exchange for lesser charges.Papadopoulos, on the other hand, told the FBI that his Russian contacts weren t anyone important and that they had nothing to do with Trump, his campaign, or the election. We now know he was in Europe, meeting with Russians and trying arrange meetings between none other than Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. There s a direct line back to the campaign there, whereas the charges against Manafort and Gates could be seen as only tangentially related.Papadopoulos is already a cooperating witness in Mueller s investigation, and there is no evidence yet that Manafort or Gates have flipped, or will flip. And since everything about Papadopoulos  arrest has to do with his activities on the campaign, that makes him far more dangerous to Trump right now than Gates and Manafort.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", 4 Reasons Why This Little-Known Trump Aide Is More Dangerous To Trump Than Paul Manafort

"November 11, 2016","Well, well, well, look what we have here.During his meeting with President Obama, Donald Trump apparently was convinced that repealing Obamacare is probably not a good idea after all.According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump told reporters after the meeting that he may just simply  amend  Obama s signature healthcare law and said he would consider suggestions the president made during their discussion. Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,  Trump said.  I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that. It s not a guarantee, but it s definitely a reversal from he has been telling his supporters throughout his campaign for the last year and a half.Republicans have been trying to destroy the healthcare law for years and even shut the government down in protest of the law. They were hoping Donald Trump would be a rubber stamp to their agenda and now it turns out President Obama may have reasoned with Trump. And considering over 100,000 Americans have signed up for an Obamacare health plan already this year and repealing the law could seriously hurt millions of Americans, including conservatives, it looks like Trump has changed his tune on a core campaign promise.And of course, his supporters are already starting to throw a hissy fit about it.@thehill KEEP YOUR PROMISE AND REPEAL IT DON T SELL US OUT BEFORE YOU ARE SOWRN IN KEEP YOUR WORD &DON T LET US DOWN  ERNIE (@GRANDPASOF) November 11, 2016@thehill watch it!

"November 11, 2017","In the late 1970 s, Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore (R- Of Course) would have been in his early 30 s. However, he liked little girls   literally. A bombshell report in the Washington Post alleges that Moore, who was 32 in 1979, approached Leigh Corfman in a courthouse. Corfman was 14 at the time. Moore picked the little girl up near her home, drove her to his home in the woods, and proceeded to molest her, according to the story. Now, this is the man who is running for the United States Senate. The thing is, though, Moore s political career should have been over and done with decades ago.You see, according to people who worked with Roy Moore at the time, it was, quote,  common knowledge  that he liked dating high schoolers. Moore s former colleague Theresa Jones, who was a Deputy District Attorney with Moore at the time, says of the situation: It was common knowledge that Roy dated high school girls, everyone we knew thought it was weird We wondered why someone his age would hang out at high school football games and the mall but you really wouldn t say anything to someone like that.

"November 12, 2016","Since Republicans had such a problem with President Obama going on vacation and playing golf, they ll be totally opposed to Donald Trump doing even more of both, right?Because while President Obama and his family moved into the White House and took less vacation time than any Republican president in the last 40 years, it looks like Trump wants to spend much of his term playing golf or relaxing at his gold-plated apartment in Trump Tower.According to The New York Times,Mr. Trump, a homebody who often flew several hours late at night during the campaign so he could wake up in his own bed in Trump Tower, is talking with his advisers about how many nights a week he will spend in the White House. He has told them he would like to do what he is used to, which is spending time in New York when he can.The questions reflect what Mr. Trump s advisers described as the president-elect s coming to grips with the fact that his life is about to change radically. They say that Mr. Trump, who was shocked when he won the election, might spend most of the week in Washington, much like members of Congress, and return to Trump Tower or his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., or his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on weekends.In other words, Trump isn t interested in being president full-time. He wants to vacation and golf. And if he gets the schedule he wants, he would end up spending 416 days away from Washington over the course of four years. Far MORE days than the 217 days President Obama spent on vacation in eight years.And that s not even counting official vacations Trump will likely take.Furthermore, if Trump plays one round of golf every weekend, he will play more golf in two years than President Obama played during his whole first term.So while Trump is away, it s likely the responsibility of governing will be left to his advisers and cabinet members.If Donald Trump is serious about governing, he should be in Washington full-time. Also, he should never take a vacation or play a single round of golf during his term because for years, Trump and his supporters bitched every time President Obama left the White House for just about any little thing. And they definitely despised him for playing golf.

First, there s the fact that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore has been accused of  dating  girls as young as 14, and actually molesting said 14-year-old. What s worse is the fact that instead of demanding that Moore leave the race, many Alabama Republicans have been defending him. One of them, Alabama GOP Auditor Jim Ziegler, even used the Bible as a justification for Moore s alleged actions.Now, the GOP has another mess on their hands when it comes to perversion in their ranks: Minnesota State Rep. Tony Cornish. The Star Tribune obtained a text message Cornish sent to a fellow lawmaker, in which he joked about how aroused he was while looking at her on the State House Floor. The Star Tribune says of the text message they received: Maye Quade, first elected in 2016, provided the Star Tribune with a text message from Cornish in May 2017 in which he wrote that he  got busted for staring at you on the House floor   Haha. I told him it was your fault, of course. Look too damned good. Ha. I must be more gentlemanly when I run for governor. As if that were not bad enough, there s Cornish s treatment of a female lobbyist in his office. The lobbyist alleges that Cornish trapped her in the office and insisted that she help him with his, quote,  raging boner.  City Pages says of that incident: The most disturbing allegations against Cornish come from a lobbyist who asked to have her identity protected. The lobbyist says Cornish engaged in a years-long campaign of harassment, soliciting her for sex in text messages   she rebuffed him   and once pushing her against a wall in his office and trying to kiss her.On another occasion, during a meeting in his office, the woman says she was attempting to leave when Cornish stood up and pointed down, saying:  I have a raging boner. You can t leave.  This, the lobbyist says, Cornish said twice; she did leave, anyway.And let s remember   for every one of these incidences that gets reported, there s usually bunches more that don t, because of the way people who come forward regarding being sexually harassed and assaulted are treated.Get your act together, GOP. This behavior is not just unacceptable. It s criminal. Oh, and let s not forget   you guys are the ones who go around judging and moralizing on the lives of others. So much so, in fact, that many of you make entire careers of doing just that. Family values indeed.Featured image via tonycornish.com"," Perverted GOP State Rep.

"November 13, 2016","Despite the fact that Donald Trump received fewer votes than his opponent, Hillary Clinton, he s the victor from Tuesday s election and his supporters aren t handling it well. The worst have behaved deplorably, with hate crimes on the rise. You ve probably seen the less violent Trump supporters on social media, where they have been smug and sometimes verbally abusive. The takeaway, though, at least to them, is that there is still only one group of voters who matter in this country, and that s the white working class. The rest, according to Trump voters, should just bow down.This was the sort of behavior on display on Sunday s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, where the guests included right-wing shill Mary Matalin and liberal icon Van Jones. Needless to say, Jones didn t let Matalin go far with her condescending and downright insulting whitesplaining.After the election, Jones emotionally called the election what it was,  whitelash.  Here it is:The right, who could have chosen the magnanimous route and addressed Jones  concerns, instead chose to belittle him. Matalin did just that by telling him how, as a successful and educated black man, he should ignore racism and simply tell his fellow African-Americans that they too should bow to the white working class. Here s the transcript and video via Media Matters:MARY MATALIN: Van has, to my mind, retracted your whitelash with what you just said   No, that we have to not focus totally on the toxic stuff   OK, but you should, and if you don t you re wrong. You are not   that s not the path for progressives. We ve all agreed at the outset of this show that the path, which is Ellison s message, you say, is to go back to the rust belt and the rednecks   you re not going to get there with climate change and Putin and all the rest of  JONES: Now listen, I said and stand by it. I said that race was a part and there was a part, that alt-right part, it was a part of a whitelash. If you listened to the whole quote you would agree with what I said, so I don t take that back  MATALIN: I did listen and you said  what do I tell the kids.  What I would tell your kids,  I m a black man in America who went to Yale, who s written books, who served a president and now  JONES: And I m a ninth generation American man and I m the first one in my family born with all my rights. I m a ninth generation American, and so we have not escaped, because I went to Yale, all the problems of this country.Matalin went on to say that Jones should be a racial reconciler, not a polemicist. That s when Jones very politely and very quietly lost it.JONES: You should be ashamed of yourself for attempting to say that to my face. I have spent more time  MATALIN: Would I say it behind your back would be better?JONES: I spent more time than you have trying to be a racial reconciler in this country.MATALIN: Really? How do you know that? Do you know anything about me?JONES: Apparently you don t know anything about me.[ ]Here s the video:Trump voters need to know a few things. First off, only about a quarter of Americans voted for their candidate. Secondly, his election does not give them the moral high ground, and they certainly have not behaved well enough to lecture us on our behavior. Not that they ll listen to me. The implication with Trump s election is that for the next four years, discussions of racism and inequality are off the table. That s frightening. Any progress we ve made over the last several decades will go up in smoke.If Van Jones were any less a man, he probably would have lost his temper, and really, who could blame him. Instead, he handled being whitesplained to with class and elegance. That s so much more than Trump voters have shown him or the rest of us.Featured image via video screen capture.

"November 13, 2017","After Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was finally publicly outed after decades of alleged sexual abuses toward women, a #metoo hashtag formed and a dam broke. Suddenly it seemed that every time we turned on our computers, every time we received a phone alert, it was yet another man outed as an abuser.The worst of the worst of sexual abusers, though, are those who abuse children. Roy Moore, the right-wing Christian nut-job who s running for Senate in Alabama has been accused of doing just that. Five women have now come forward alleging that Moore  dated  them and worse while they were teens and he was in his 30s.This all began almost a year to the day after an audio tape of Donald Trump bragging about how he s such a big star he can just grab women s pussies. Is it possible, though, that Trump is as bad, if not worse, than Moore?While liberals and Democrats have decried the alleged abusers, regardless of ideology or party affiliation, Republicans have taken a *shall we say* more nuanced stance when it comes to Moore. They have invoked the Bible, saying that the Virgin Mary was a teenager when Jesus was born. Of course, much like they forget the  well regulated militia  part of the Second Amendment, these men who would slut shame their own sisters if they were Democrats who wanted birth control, suddenly forgot the first part of Mary s moniker. They also defended Moore by saying that he was just a fragile young buck of 32, who couldn t have possibly known better, while his alleged victims were well on their way to adulthood at 14 and 16.Donald Trump has been surprisingly mum about the Moore allegations, but spokesperson Kellyanne Conway carefully straddled the line by saying that  if  the allegations were true, Moore should resign. Trump, though, had something interesting to say about the subject of statutory rape three years ago. In a tweet, Trump called it  talent  to  date  a woman who s young enough to be his daughter. Note: he was married to Melania at the time.@rexrode_lisa ""@realDonaldTrump you date girls young enough to be your daughter.That's perverted"" Dated. No, that's talent.  Donald J.

A poll taken after the accusations began to surface showed Moore with a 10 point lead against his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones. If we haven t thrown in the moral towel as a country, Republicans certainly have.

"November 14, 2017","If the scandal around the stories of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore s accusations of dating of teenage girls is accomplishing anything, it s drawing a line in the sand. Republicans are having to declare themselves either pro-pedophilia or anti.You d think it would be an easy choice to make, but hey, we have an accused pedophile in the White House, so maybe not so easy for the GOP party. Even Ted Cruz, though, who is one of the most extreme in Washington (and one of the most loathed) has withdrawn his support of Moore.One Republican, though, is holding on and he s shocked (I tell you) that anyone would ever call him an extremist over it.Rob Maness, who has the endorsement of Sarah Palin, Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Ben Carson, is running for the Louisiana State House. During a radio interview, a caller called Maness  an extremist,  precisely because he s to the right of Ted Cruz, at least on the subject of statutory rape.The caller went by the moniker of  flaming liberal  for WGSO-AM. His real name, though, is David Bellinger. He said about Maness,  If you re to the right of Ted Cruz, you re an extremist.  Hard to argue that since there is pretty much no one more extreme than Cruz, who believes that Planned Parenthood sells body parts and that the states can ignore the Supreme Court s ruling making gay marriage legal. Maness was having none of that accusation. Whoa, you just called me an extremist, brother,  said Maness, a retired Air Force colonel who went on to outline his military background, including top-secret clearances. I ve done everything this country has ever asked me to do. How dare you call me an extremist,  he said.  I m the most investigated, stable man that the country could have ever given the keys to nuclear weapons to, so you can blow me! You can blow me and get out of here if you re gonna talk like that and call me an extremist. Source: The AdvocateJust two things here: Maness is not running for an office where he would get the keys to nuclear weapons and well, his answer doesn t make him seem a very  stable man. Bellinger shot back, Go screw your ma, asshole,  several times.Maness, still fuming, said: I m not going to listen to that crap,  he said after jettisoning Bellinger.  Nobody s gonna call me an extremist, because I m not one. The extremists are the people who are liars, and the hypocrites and the swamp creatures from Washington, D.C. and Baton Rouge and all around the nation, even at the local level, that have got their political power and they try to smear people like me because we want to take it away from them.

"November 15, 2016","Admiral Michael Rogers, the current head of the National Security Agency s Cybersecurity division, confirmed today that Wikileaks  email releases, possibly along with Russia s hacking of the DNC during the summer, were a concerted effort to create a specific outcome in our election. If their goal was to elect Donald Trump, then it certainly worked and our election was, in fact, rigged.He was speaking at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council, and the subject was actually the rocky relationship between the NSA and the private sector. He argued that the private sector needs to give him more access to their network structures, while the private sector inherently distrusts the government and its intentions.During that interview, though, he fielded a question about Wikileaks releasing batches of emails from John Podesta, one of Hillary s close aides and confidantes: You told NPR in August that  these emails were clearly leaked for a reason and they were leaked I believe to achieve an effect.  What can you tell us about Wikileaks from what you know? He replied with: There shouldn t be any doubt in anybody s mind This was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily. This was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect. He went on to explain a little about going after hackers by hardening systems and increasing knowledge, and they re also trying to hurt hackers by working with other countries on the problem.

"November 16, 2016","In one of his first moves since becoming the President-Elect, Donald Trump has chosen one of the worst human beings in the country as his Chief Strategist. Steve Bannon was the Editor in Chief of Breitbart News, a site that s popular with white nationalists. Democrats in Congress have penned a letter asking Trump to fire Bannon. Every single Republican sided with the white nationalist. If that doesn t tell you everything you need to know about today s Republican party, nothing will.Why do white nationalists flock to Bannon s former site? Well, for one thing, the site defends white nationalists. If you want to be creeped out, read this. If you aren t sure what the alt-right is, this article will tell you in chilling detail about the pro-Russian isolationists who believe in studying race differences, with, of course, white Christians coming out on top.Then there are articles blaming African-Americans, really for nearly everything, but especially for crime.In normal times, Washington conservatives and the Bannon alt-right can t stand each other. The alt-right is isolationist. Washington conservatives are hawkish. More significantly, as the Washington Post put it:Constitutional conservatives can t stand the alt-right. Conservatives   real conservatives   believe that only a philosophy of limited government, God-given rights and personal responsibility can save the country. And that creed is not bound to race or ethnicity. Broad swaths of the alt-right, by contrast, believe in a creed-free, race-based nationalism, insisting, among other things, that birth on American soil confers superiority. The alt-right sees limited-government constitutionalism as pass ; it holds that only nationalist populism on the basis of shared tribal identity can save the country. It s a movement shot through with racism and anti-Semitism.Not this year. Donald Trump has effectively normalized the underbelly of racism. While Congress for years has been hinting at their own racism with their refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of our first African-American President, few have admitted their racism, until now.If you still aren t convinced, those applauding the Bannon appointment include former KKK leader David Duke and the chairman of the Nazi Party. Nearly every civil rights group opposed the appointment.When Democrats wrote the letter, signed by 169 members of Congress, to fire Bannon, not a single Republican was brave enough or had enough integrity to agree that a white nationalist shouldn t be in the White House.Here s one of the key passages:Since the election there have been a number of incidents across the country in which minorities, including Muslim-Americans, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Jewish-Americans have been the targets of violence, harassment and intimidation. Mr. Bannon s appointment sends the wrong message to people who have engaged in those types of activities, indicating that they will not only be tolerated, but endorsed by your administration. Millions of Americans have expressed fear and concern about how they will be treated by the Trump administration, and your appointment of Mr. Bannon only exacerbates and validates their concerns.Very proud to be leading 169 Members of Congress asking @realDonaldTrump to rescind his appointment of alt-right leader Steve Bannon. pic.twitter.com/JSz9IPT9Gv  ((David Cicilline)) (@davidcicilline) November 16, 2016There is little political fallout from disavowing a white nationalist, at least you d think, but the Republican voters have proven that racism and white supremacy no longer belong in the closet.

"November 17, 2016","The Democrats weren t able to outright win the Senate back from the GOP, but the GOP s majority isn t exactly huge or secure. And there s still a Senate race in Louisiana that has gone to a runoff, to be held on Dec. 10. John Kennedy and Foster Campbell are both up for that particular seat, and should it go to Campbell, the Democrat, it would close that margin even more.Think it can t happen because Louisiana is a deep-red state? They elected a Democratic governor just last year after Republican Governor Bobby Jindal ran them into the ground. Also, their runoffs, despite deciding who actually wins an election, have pretty low turnout. If people in the state are unhappy enough with Trump and with the GOP, those people could turn out for the runoff and swing it to Campbell s side easily.Okay, so that s just one seat and Republicans would still control the Senate with a 51-46 margin. There are two independents Senators Bernie Sanders and Angus King who both tend to vote with the Democrats, so 51-48, with one uncalled race. Should Campbell win, that s effectively a 51-49 margin.We can math, and so can you, so we all know 49 is less than 51. To achieve a majority, someone else has to switch sides. Oddly enough, that isn t exactly impossible, either. Senator John McCain has already made it clear he s not going to play ball with everything Trump wants to do. In fact, McCain is more than a little annoyed over Trump s bromance with Vladimir Putin. To McCain, Putin is a dictatorial tyrant to whom we absolutely should not cozy up:That could mean bucking his own party to the point where he just switches sides.Evidently, Rand Paul and Susan Collins may be ripe for flipping, too, and if even one of them does, along with McCain, then voila! Democrats effectively control the Senate again!However, it s pretty far-fetched. Campbell could easily win the Louisiana seat but getting Republican Senators to change sides, and either vote pretty much entirely Democratic or actually become Democrats, is considerably harder in today s partisan environment. That means hoping and praying the GOP Senators who are all  principled  right now stay principled enough to thwart their party and Donald Trump if and when it comes to that.In short, don t hold your breath. But don t give up hope, either. We didn t think Trump could win, and he did, and there are a lot of Republicans and conservatives who are just as unhappy with that as we are. Since the next four years started off with the nearly impossible, then hoping for more  impossibilities  may not be in vain.If you would like to help Campbell win his runoff election and give the Democrats another seat in the Senate, you can donate to his campaign here.

Okay, the survey didn t specify World War but it did ask if they trusted the U.S. president to handle world affairs.The rest of the world wasn t quite as dramatic, but as you can see from this chart below, the world really hates Trump.In July, his results were somewhat better, but he was still wildly hated by the majority of the world s citizens.This is a lot bigger deal than just a few statistics. It took a long time to build our standing in the world. Since World War II, right or wrong, the United States has been seen as a moral leader. We are certainly an economic leader. Now we have no leg to stand on, even when fighting for own interests. We may be witnessing the death of the world s longest living democracy and it s all because millions of people threw a temper tantrum over the fact that a black man was president and that a woman wanted to be president.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.", Donald Trump Is Destroying The Country’s Reputation And Here’s Proof

"November 18, 2017","Conservatives should shun Tony Perkins for this.Earlier this week, Ohio GOP state Rep. Wes Goodman was busted for carrying on a same-sex affair in his taxpayer funded office, forcing him to tender his resignation.But there is an even worse transgression in Goodman s past, one that should drag the Family Research Council leader to hell with him.As it turns out, Goodman once fondled an 18-year-old without consent in his hotel room at the Ritz Carlton in Washington D.C.The teen s stepfather was quick to alert Perkins of the incident via email, warning him that continuing to endorse Goodman would be a mistake. If we endorse these types of individuals, then it would seem our whole weekend together was nothing more than a charade,  the teen s stepfather wrote. Trust me,  Perkins replied.  This will not be ignored nor swept aside. It will be dealt with swiftly, but with prudence. Perkins withdrew his support and suspended Goodman from the Council for National Policy. Going forward so soon, without some distance from your past behavior and a track record of recovery, carries great risk for you and for those who are supporting you,  Perkins wrote to Goodman.But Perkins failed to report the crime to law enforcement. Instead, he kept quiet and allowed a sexual predator to gain public office. In fact, even the board members of the Council for National Policy knew about the crime because Perkins informed them, and none of them did a damn thing about it.And this all happened just two years ago in 2015. Surely, Perkins and the board members he told can still be prosecuted for failing to report Goodman to the authorities.Because they definitely should be.Featured Image: Wikimedia", Conservative ‘Christian’ Leader Kept A Sexual Assault Secret For A Republican Lawmaker
"November 19, 2016","Following a traumatic Election Night and Donald Trump s unexpected win (of the electoral college), Democrats have been scrambling to figure out what went wrong. Beyond finding out where polling malfunctioned, liberals are struggling to understand what has happened within the party and how to go about fixing it. But as usual, there are some very different ideas about where the problem lies and how to remedy the situation   even when it comes to diversity.Two very different visions for the future of the Democratic PartyAccording to Mark Lilla of the New York Times, we need to quit focusing on our individual identities if we hope to save the Democratic party. In his piece The End of Identity Liberalism, he writes that we have been taught to celebrate  our differences. However, he argues that  this is a splendid principle of moral pedagogy   but disastrous as a foundation for democratic politics in our ideological age. In recent years American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing. Our focus on teaching diversity in schools, Lilla said,  has produced a generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self-defined groups, and indifferent to the task of reaching out to Americans in every walk of life. Lilla said that Hillary Clinton s great mistake was appealing to each individual group, which left out the white working class. National politics in healthy periods is not about  difference,  it is about commonality. And it will be dominated by whoever best captures Americans  imaginations about our shared destiny. He rejected the  whitelash  theory but also failed to acknowledge the blatant racism of Trump s campaign. He writes,  the whitelash thesis is convenient because it absolves liberals of not recognizing how their own obsession with diversity has encouraged white, rural, religious Americans to think of themselves as a disadvantaged group whose identity is being threatened or ignored. However, Lilla said nothing about the racism, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia that was the basis of Trump s campaign. Trump used the racial tensions that resulted from having a black man in the white house and stoked the fires of bigotry. From the first day Trump announced that he was running for president, he used xenophobia to rally white America behind him. He was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan and has now installed a white nationalist as his chief strategist.Trump never, at any point, offered a real plan for  making America great again  other than to promise that he would make life hell for anybody who isn t a straight white Christian male. But bigotry was enough to rally white America behind him.Lilla then warned that  Liberals should bear in mind that the first identity movement in American politics was the Ku Klux Klan, which still exists. Those who play the identity game should be prepared to lose it.  He concludes that  we need a post-identity liberalism,  and argued that taking on the concerns of specific minorities can be risky.We need a post-identity liberalism, and it should draw from the past successes of pre-identity liberalism. Such a liberalism would concentrate on widening its base by appealing to Americans as Americans and emphasizing the issues that affect a vast majority of them. It would speak to the nation as a nation of citizens who are in this together and must help one another. As for narrower issues that are highly charged symbolically and can drive potential allies away, especially those touching on sexuality and religion, such a liberalism would work quietly, sensitively and with a proper sense of scale. (To paraphrase Bernie Sanders, America is sick and tired of hearing about liberals  damn bathrooms.)Steve Phillips at the Nation has a radically different solution to what he feels is the problem facing progressives, as he wrote in his article, It s Time to Diversify the Democratic Party Leadership. And this picture says it all:Phillips explains that  nearly the entire top level of progressive leadership that controlled $1.5 billion in spending was made up of white people.   All of the individuals in the above table are good people, but none of them are from the hood. They don t hang out in black barbershops and beauty salons. They don t feel their hearts race when they see a police car s lights shining in their rear view mirror. They don t have family facing deportation to Mexico. They ve never been told to  go back to where you came from,  called a racial slur, or told to speak English. They ve never been detained at an airport because they look suspicious. They haven t lived the experiences of the people who comprise almost half of all Democratic voters.To win elections in an increasingly multiracial nation requires leadership and top staff who come from, understand, and are committed to the rapidly growing communities of color that are transforming the composition of the country. Whereas Lilla says we need to move away from identity, Phillips argues that now is the time, more than ever, to embrace our diversity at the top level of the Democratic party s leadership.  As last week s election revealed, the foundation of the Democratic home is structurally unsound. The time is now to focus on and fix the problem, and the first step in that direction is putting in place party leadership who understand how to build power and win elections in a racially combustible environment,  Phillips concluded.I tend to think it is a mixture of both these philosophies. Without a doubt, we need more diversity at the top. Even though Lilla got so much wrong, he was right in that we must find the common threads that unite us all as Americans. Yet, it is impossible to do that without acknowledging individuality and cultural diversity. To do that, we must do exactly as Phillips said and make sure the leadership of our party reflects the ever more diverse makeup of the country.Featured image via insurestory.com", Two VERY Different Visions For The Future Of The Democratic Party Are Battling It Out
"November 19, 2017","Republicans in Texas, including Gov. Greg Abbott, ripped into the new $44 billion White House disaster relief aid request as  inadequate.  It s been two months since the state was devastated by Hurricane Harvey and Donald Trump has failed on his promise to rebuild Texas. Abbott s criticism is strikingly different than the day after Trump visited Texas in the aftermath of the hurricane. His commitment was firm, strong and unequivocal,  Abbott said at the time.  That he was going to do everything he could to ensure that Texas will be restored as swiftly, as effectively as possible. But now, two months later, Republicans are calling the response  wholly inadequate,  according to the Dallas News.The White House disaster relief aid request falls well short of the demands made by officials from Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.Greg Abbott said that the request  does not live up  to what Trump pledged in recovery aid. Abbott noted during a news conference that he s still reviewing the White House request but that it appears to be  completely inadequate.  What s more, Abbott said, it  does not live up  to what Trump has pledged in recovery aid, then he said that Washington worked faster for victims of Superstorm Sandy than for Harvey. Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012 during the Obama administration, by the way. The president has told me privately what he said publicly, and that is he wants to be the builder president. The president has said he wants this to be the best recovery from a disaster ever,  Abbott said.It s not just Abbott. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, blasted the request as  wholly inadequate.  A chorus of Texas lawmakers slammed it as insufficient.Houston Rep. John Culberson, a Republican and appropriations committee member, ripped Trump s recovery efforts, calling the request a  complete lack of understanding of the fundamental needs of Texans  and said it is a  nightmare  for Harvey survivors.Democrats, too, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, are criticizing the measure as measly.If only someone has warned Abbott and his Republican colleagues to not trust Trump, then maybe they wouldn t be so shocked. Maybe we would have a different leader who has the ability to deal with critical issues. Wait, they were warned, weren t they?Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.", Texas Governor Just Broke With Trump; This Is Unprecedented
"November 2, 2016","As Election Day approaches, the threat of violence and bloodshed is becoming more and more likely.So far, the threats of a violent coup against the federal government had only been coming from a few deplorable Trump supporters like Dan Bowman who told the Boston Globe last month that he is literally hoping that conservatives overthrow the federal government in the event that Trump loses to Hillary Clinton on November 8th. If she s in office, I hope we can start a coup,  he said.  She should be in prison or shot. That s how I feel about it. We re going to have a revolution and take them out of office if that s what it takes. There s going to be a lot of bloodshed. But that s what it s going to take I would do whatever I can for my country. Many Trump supporters have echoed Bowman in one way or another in response to Trump s dubious claims that the election is  rigged  against him.And now things just escalated because right-wing militias are actively preparing to join such a movement should their fellow Trump supporters follow through on their threats.The Oathkeepers and Three Percent Security Force are right-wing militia groups that have been conducting training sessions in recent weeks in preparation for a violent rebellion if Donald Trump loses the election.Right-wing terrorist wannabe Chris Hill told Reuters that his militia group is training to  save America. This is the last chance to save America from ruin,  Hill said.  I m surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same. Hill further implied that his group will act to  protect  any so-called  protesters  who try to overthrow the government, which means shooting federal authorities who try to disarm them. I will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process,  Hill said.  We ve been building up for this, just like the Marines,  he continued.  We are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come. In other words, these Trump supporting militias are have literally been preparing to launch a terrorist attack against the United States if the election does not go their way.And it s even scarier because these gun nuts don t think they can be punished for their actions since the Bundy brothers and their fellow terrorists were acquitted by a jury in what is one of the worst miscarriages of justice in American history. Now right-wing militias are only emboldened. If the Bundys can seize a federal building and get away with it, maybe they think they can get away with overthrowing the federal government.These people are a threat to our democracy and our institutions and they should be arrested before Election Day to ensure public safety. If Trump loses he needs to grow a pair and concede, because if he doesn t he should be charged and imprisoned for any blood that is spilled as a result of his refusal to do what every other losing presidential contender has done throughout American history.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images", Right-Wing Militias Preparing To Wage War If Hillary Clinton Beats Trump
"November 2, 2017","Donald Trump very obviously has a specific type of woman he likes, and whom he prefers to represent him. He is a horrid misogynist who thinks women s worth lies solely in our ability to stir his penis to life (or not). He likes his women tall, thin, big-breasted basically supermodel quality. Knowing that, one would think that Sarah Huckabee Sanders doesn t fit his mold nearly well enough to be his press secretary, and yet, she is. Why?In a brilliant op-ed for the L.A Times, David Horsey turns a light bulb on about why Trump would prefer Sarah Sanders over virtually anyone else (including Sean Spicer)   she has a singular comfort with distorting the truth that Spicer never had, and she s obviously far more comfortable with it than anyone besides Kellyanne Conway. Horsey says: But now I get it. Anyone who is going to be tasked with the job of explaining this president to the news media needs to be comfortable with saying things that are demonstrably not true. That was the problem with Sanders  predecessor, Sean Spicer. Lying seemed to fluster him. When he was challenged on any blatantly erroneous statement, he would get red-faced and petulant. It was as if he was trying to signal a message to reporters:  Come on, guys, lay off! Don t make me humiliate myself on live TV!  [emphasis mine]By contrast, Sanders is perfectly fine with saying that Paul Manafort s indictment has nothing whatsoever to do with Trump. She had no issue spinning Trump s tax breaks for the wealthy into a $4,000/year raise for American families. Despite being a woman, she s perfectly fine saying that the women accusing Trump of sexual assault are all lying simply because that s Trump s position. As for the entire Russia scandal, including a report that Trump has lost his mind over it, Horsey says: Taking the offensive, Sanders confidently delivered the new Republican talking point that, if anyone were guilty of colluding with Moscow, it was Hillary Clinton   which is the boldest evasion anyone in the Trump camp has come up with, so far.  [emphasis mine]Horsey paints Sanders as the spin-meister she is   someone who effortlessly puts forth the idea that the facts of anything and everything are  nothing more than what you want them to be. By that new standard, Sanders is a pro.  [emphasis mine]And that, ladies and gentleman, is why Trump has her as his press secretary. He needs someone who has a demonstrable problem with the truth.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images", Sarah Huckabee Sanders SHREDDED By L.A. Times For Truth-Twisting – This Is Brilliant
"November 20, 2016","After Trump s latest Twitter rant over the performance protest, or rather, polite urging of Mike Pence, the true big story of the day had some daylight, but not near enough. Trump, who claims he never settles lawsuits, did just that on Saturday when he agreed to pay $25 million in the Trump University fraud suits. While that might seem like a bit of justice served, it was revealed on Sunday that it will be the taxpayers who will pick up the bill.To be fair, it s not Trump s fault. It s the fault of the US tax code, which, as usual, favors the wealthy   you know, the people who can afford to pay $25 million in lawsuit settlements.Of course, the real cost to Mr. Trump is after tax, not before it. And most business settlements are fully tax deductible. The only part that arguably may not be here is the $1 million in penalties. But barring express non-deductibility commitments, many penalties can be deducted, too. In general, fines and penalties paid to the government are not deductible. Section 162(f) of the tax code prohibits deducting  any fine or similar penalty paid to a government for the violation of any law. Despite punitive sounding names, though, some fines and penalties are considered remedial and deductible. That allows some flexibility. Companies often deduct  compensatory penalties,  a maneuver affirmed in a recent Circuit Court ruling. Some defendants insist that their settlement agreement confirms that the payments are not penalties and are remedial. Conversely, some government entities insist on the reverse. Explicit provisions about taxes in settlement agreements are becoming more common.Source: ForbesYes, that is tax code, but there are exceptions which the Justice Department can enforce. For example, Credit Suisse was forbidden from writing off its fine of $2.6 billion for tax evasion.This all brings us back to the fact that we still don t have access to Donald Trump s tax returns. He doesn t pay taxes at all and in fact, one year, he reported a near billion dollar loss.Trump supporters paint him in a passive light. After all, it s not his fault the tax code is so easy for the wealthy to manipulate. The fact is, though, it s wealthy people like him who have been writing the tax laws for decades. That s why they are able to pay far less, as a percentage of income, than most Americans.If you expect this will get better with Trump in office, let s hope you re not holding your breath. Trump was caught just last week promising a restaurant full of wealthy people that he would be lowering their taxes. Of course, he didn t need to be caught on a hot mic. Analysts have already figured out that Trump s tax plan will benefit the wealthy, and only the wealthy, all while putting the country deeper and deeper into debt.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.", About That Trump University Fine – There’s A Huge Catch; You And I Will Pay It

"November 21, 2016","One of Donald Trump s biggest ideas and a way he hopes to peel off support from some Democrats is to propose a big infrastructure bill. Trump and his team believe that positioning infrastructure as an investment in America that would also employ people will get Democrats to budge.But Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is now loudly pointing out that the Trump infrastructure idea is just another in his long line of  scam  proposals.Bernie Sanders called Donald Trump s infrastructure plan a  scam  that only helps large companies and Wall Street billionaires on Monday.Trump s plan gives giant tax credits for private companies that invest in projects, lowering the cost of financing the project significantly. Sanders took issue with the tax loopholes afforded by the plan. Trump would allow corporations that have stashed their profits overseas to pay just a fraction of what the companies owe in federal taxes,  he wrote.  And then he would allow the companies to  invest  in infrastructure projects in exchange for even more tax breaks. Trump s plan is corporate welfare coming and going. Other influential voices like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman have also pointed out the attempt at graft and greed that would no doubt be present in a Trump infrastructure proposal.Democrats hoping to regain power will be tested to stand up to attempts to schmooze them from Trump and a compliant media eager to give the incoming president a  win.  They hope to maintain opposition to Trump in the same manner that Republicans in the House and Senate have refused to work with President Obama since they took power.Some conservative Democrats have indicated that they want to consider Trump s proposals. That includes Sen. Jon Tester (MT) and Sen. Joe Manchin (WV), but both men come from states that went heavily for Trump and a lot of their rhetoric can be chalked up more to craven politics and fear of the right wing than actual principles and values.Featured image via Flickr", Bernie Just Uncovered A HUGE ‘Scam’ Trump Thought You Wouldn’t Notice
"November 21, 2017","Donald Trump just got his ass handed to him by Nicolle Wallace for endorsing an accused child molester.Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore has been accused of sexual assault by several women, most of whom were teens at the time. One woman was 14-years-old.Age of consent laws apparently did not matter to Moore, who was the district attorney during the time period in which most of the assaults allegedly occurred. Moore own former colleagues have confirmed that Moore preyed upon teenage girls and he was even banned from a shopping mall because he kept creeping on teen girls.On Tuesday, Trump finally spoke out about Moore and the allegations. And what he said was sickening.Trump accused Moore s opponent Doug Jones of being  soft  on crime before saying he d rather have an accused child molester in the Senate instead of a Democrat. Then he defended Moore the same way he defended Vladimir Putin during his trip to Asia. Well, he denies it, Trump said.  Look, he denies it. I mean, if you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn t happen and you know, you have to listen to him also. Trump s words were so disgusting that MSNBC s Nicolle Wallace took him to the woodshed. I have this physical feeling of just being repulsed listening to   be it a figure head, he is the head of the Republican Party and I have described myself as a nonpracticing member, but I don t know what other word to use other than repulsed, that the head of the Republican Party said essentially threw his weight behind someone accused of stalking and engaging in sexual activity with a 14-year-old. There s nothing normal about throwing your weight behind a child molester. So when he says, this president says  he denies it, he denies it  I almost heard in him,  I denied it too.  He s almost projecting on to Roy Moore his own circumstance. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Trump was accused of sexual assault by over a dozen women during the campaign.

"November 22, 2016","If there s one thing that unites working class Americans of all political persuasions, it s a hatred of Wall Street. Donald Trump knows this   he campaigned on it in Iowa, in fact, saying  I m really good at that stuff. I know Wall Street. I know the people on Wall Street. We re going to have the greatest negotiators of the world, but at the same time, I m not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We re going to tax Wall Street. These days, he s singing a different tune. Instead of taxing them, he s cutting taxes on the rich. Instead of  stopping them from getting away with murder,  they re getting rid of the financial regulations that will stop another recession. And instead of standing up for consumers, he s destroying the agency that has recouped over $10 billion from predatory financial companies.After electorally winning the election (while massively losing the popular vote   1.7 million at the time of this writing and growing), he is openly showing what many of us knew along: He doesn t give a single sh*t about any of his supporters, and he will stab them in the back repeatedly and at length until somebody stops him.Donald Trump never had any intention of raising taxes on  hedge fund guys.  After all, they re in the same class of people he is! Rich, and therefore better than you. Why should they have to pay taxes? Trump doesn t, and thinks it s smart.Trump s administration wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is the Wall Street reform and consumer protection package passed after the Great Recession to prevent the need for another bailout at taxpayer expense. Trump thinks, instead, that the banks will do better regulating themselves   much the way they did in the years leading up to the 2007-08 crash. Here s what Trump and the GOP are against:An Act to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end  too big to fail,  to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.And it gets worse.As ThinkProgress reports,Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency focused on protecting Americans from predatory and fraudulent bank behavior. It s already recouped more than $10 billion for those who have been targeted by such practices. The CFPB has also written new rules for mortgage lending while extending oversight to some financial firms, such as debt collectors and payday lenders, that had previously gone with little oversight.That s right   Donald Trump wants to get rid of one of the few parts of government that consistently works on behalf of the little guy. They re also targeting seniors:Trump made a campaign promise to impose a moratorium on all new regulations for the financial sector, but he has already targeted existing regulations for immediate dismantling. Trump adviser and hedge fund investor Anthony Scaramucci promised to reverse President Obama s executive action to protect retirees the fiduciary duty rule. It requires all financial advisers to put their clients  interests ahead of their own, rather than being able to steer clients toward more expensive options that make money for themselves. That conflicted advice is estimated to cost retirees $17 billion a year. We ve got to get rid of this,  Scaramucci told the Financial Times, calling it  unnecessary.  He had previously made this pledge while likening the rule to the 1857 Dred Scott Supreme Court decision that denied birthright citizenship to slaves and their descendants.He s giving the banks exactly what they want.In fact, he seems to think that he might need them a little closer to him so that he can really serve them well, because he s actually inviting bank executives to work in his administration   certainly a far cry from his pro-working class messages on the campaign trail. According to Politico, his leading picks for Secretary of the Treasury are a Goldman-Sachs executive and a billionaire investor.The working class Republicans that voted for Trump are some of the people who will be most hurt by the actual policies that the Trump administration wants to put into effect.

"November 22, 2017","It seems that Republican candidate for Attorney General Jeff Sessions  vacated Senate seat Roy Moore s proclivity for teenage girls was well known decades ago in Gadsden, Alabama   even within the courthouse where he worked as an Assistant District Attorney, and even within the police department. Retired police officer Faye Gary spoke with MSNBC and said of the situation: The rumor mill was that he liked young girls, and   we were advised that he was being suspended from the mall because he would hang around the young girls that worked in the stores and   really got into a place of where they say he was harassing. We were also told to watch him at the ball games, and make sure that   he didn t hang around the cheerleaders. Faye Gary went on to say that she originally thought that Moore liked, perhaps, women in their 20 s   you know, LEGAL younger women. But, no. It was actually teenagers the old creep liked. Gary also said that Moore s liking for little girls   was a known fact,  while speaking with the New York Times, going on to say,  It was treated like a joke. That s just the way it was. Of course, Roy Moore has long been a controversial character. He was removed from the Alabama Supreme Court twice, both times refusing to follow the law. The first time it was over his refusal to removed a 5,000+ pound monument of the Ten Commandments from the Supreme Court building, and the second time for ordering officials around the state to refuse to comply with the United States Supreme Court s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized marriage equality nation wide. He has also said that Representative Keith Ellison should not be allowed to serve in Congress because he is a Muslim. In other words, this is a man who has no regard for the rule of law, and is likely a child molester to boot.In short, the voters of Alabama need to reject this bigoted extremist, and, if they don t, they ll be sending a message to the rest of the nation: a child molester is much better to be seated in the Senate than a Democrat.Watch Faye Gary s comments on the matter below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images", WATCH: Retired Alabama Cop: We Were Told To Keep Roy Moore Away From High School Cheerleaders
"November 23, 2016","It s a job killer. It s a small business killer. It will eventually kill America and America s working class, so a rule that Obama put in place via executive order, which expands overtime pay for salaried workers, must go. At least that s how pro-rich, trickle-down obsessed Republicans see it. And now they have reason to cheer   a federal judge in Texas has blocked that rule. It would have extended overtime pay to millions of American workers.There s a problem, though. A glaring one that Igor Volsky pointed out on Twitter. The very people that the GOP claims to represent, particularly now that Trump is president, are the ones who will be hurt the worst by blocking this rule. It raised the mandatory overtime threshold from $23,660 to $47,500.They ve also forgotten that they re far wealthier than the millions of people who would have benefited from this rule. Here are just three examples:Paul Ryan s net worth = $566,1038He s cheering that 187,000 Wisconsinites earning less than $47,476 won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/Ea513ncXE1  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) November 23, 2016Ted Cruz s net worth = $3,013,518He s cheering that 1,244,000 Texans earning less than $47,476 now won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/fRw7dmh3gm  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) November 23, 2016McCain s net worth = $19,642,067He s cheering that 258,000 Arizonians earning less than $47,476 won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/DHm28iF4h9  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) November 23, 2016Yes, Judge Amos Mazzant said the rule actually violated the overtime stipulations of the Fair Labor Standards Act because it applied a salary-only test to overtime pay instead of the current classifications which are based on job position.However, businesses often use that part of the FLSA to justify paying as many employees as possible a pittance. They either wrongly classify many employees as exempt when they shouldn t be under the law, or they change job titles to things like  manager  to justify making them exempt. Then they continue to pay a pittance and treat them like hourly employees. All of this is illegal.It s easy for Republicans to say that blocking the overtime rule will help these hardworking Americans keep their jobs. They never think about the fact that people don t have jobs because they think it ll be fun or because they re bored. People have jobs because they have to work to live.And it s time Republicans stop pretending that it s perfectly okay for workers to be unable to make ends meet despite working insane hours or multiple jobs, because hey, at least they have a job.Champions of the working class? Hardly. It s more important to continue letting business run amok and claim that they re reining in Obama s supposedly extreme use of executive power. This is same ol , same ol  from the GOP. The working class voters that voted Republican over their economic situations are the ones who will be hurt worst.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images", GOP Forgets Something EXTREMELY Crucial As They Celebrate Blocking Obama’s Overtime Rule

Actually, the quotes aren t that old.When Trump appeared on  The View  in March 2006 with Ivanka, the alleged billionaire was asked how he would react if Playboy magazine were to ever feature his daughter s picture on its cover. I don t think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine,  Trump said.  Although she does have a very nice figure. I ve said that if Ivanka weren t my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.

He told Rolling Stone that if he weren t happily married and his daughter s father,  the narrator says, adding,  he d  well, he didn t finish the thought, but you can guess what he meant.

"November 25, 2016","A few days before Thanksgiving, a food bank in Central Texas received a letter that was so hateful it could only have been written by a Trump supporter.Dear Foodbank:I don t understand who these poor folks are that need food. I assume they consist primarily of illegals, who come to Texas for  free stuff.  And of course, our unemployed Africans, who find work too much trouble, especially when they can collect the equivalent of $40,000 a year on welfare, and other  benefits  offered to the unfit, the lazy, and the under-educated and of course, the drug addicts.I expect that most who need food are marching around whining that the congenital liar, Hillary Rodham Clinton, lost the election. Too bad; How sad.I also wonder if your organization is not one of those Phoney-Baloney, so-called  charities,  designed primarily to provide a good living to its organizers.In sort, no way.Signed,Citizen RobespierreNaturally, the food bank was mortified. The lack of empathy was disturbing,  says Paul Gaither, marketing and communications director for the Food Bank.  Most of the letters we receive say things like  we don t have anything to contribute  or  please take me off your list,  but this one was a little different. It s important that we don t categorize the people we serve as  takers  Gaither said.  Most of the people we serve have fallen on hard times or are the working poor who just can t make ends meet, and that can happen to anyone. Source: GivingCityAustinBefore I tackle how this proves we need food stamps, let s talk about the misconceptions in the surprisingly literate letter. First off, food should never be treated as a luxury. You can absolutely not call yourself pro-life while at the same time advocating that people should starve. Of the 37 million people who are fed every year by food banks, 14 million of them are children and 3 million are seniors.As for undocumented immigrants, well, they aren t crossing the border to eat at food banks. They are crossing the border, for the most part, to work and that s what they do. Collectively, undocumented immigrants contribute almost $12 billion each year to our country because they pay taxes and get nothing in return. We should be thanking them instead of sending hateful notes about them.It s not just unemployed people who need food banks, so do people who work minimum wage jobs. Texas happens to be among the states with the very lowest wages. Only Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi have lower wages. In other words, in states like Texas, laziness has nothing to do with the ability to put food on the table.Now, back to the food stamps argument. One Republican argument has always been that if the government stops offering a social safety net, private charities will pick up the slack. While that sounds like a beautiful idea (sort of), it s simply not true. People s ability to eat should not depend on the whims of people, nor should it depend on the economy or whether a charity can effectively market itself. We tried that in the past. It didn t work.Instead, that time in history proved that privately funded charities can be both bigoted and very selective in who they cover. If you can imagine the writer of this letter, for example, giving to any charity, do you honestly think (s)he d give to a charity that serviced minority areas? No. That s where government comes in. Making sure Americans have enough food is our moral prerogative. Relying on bigots like Citizen Robespierre should be out of the question, no matter who is hungry.As for the Central Texas Food Bank, well, they are a damn good charity. They score 100 out of 100 on Charity Navigator. The vast majority of the people they serve are not homeless. 1/3 of the recipients are white.Featured image via State Farm/Flickr.", Hateful Letter To Food Bank PROVES We Need Food Stamps (IMAGE)
"November 25, 2017","Over the last few weeks, I ve watched as the last shreds of the Republican Party s  family values  rotted away.As Alabama voters prepare to go to the polls in December they have two choices before them.They can vote for the Democrat and prove that they refuse to tolerate an accused child molester and sexual predator being in their party and in the Senate, or they can put political power over the morality they have long preached about.In other words, they can either put power over principles or put principles over power.They can t do both.And while they are damned if they do and damned if they don t, choosing the latter of those two options would be a far better and more honorable choice.Some things go above politics, and sexual assault is, and rightfully should, be one of them.Voting for Moore for the sake of political power throws every sexual assault victim under the bus. It will especially be a slap in the face of women across the country, a major voting block that has already been overwhelmingly voting Democrat for many years.If Republicans want to have any chance of surviving as a legitimate political party for many more decades to come, it is critical that they start by drawing a line in the sand when it comes to Moore and the people who defend him such as Donald Trump.This starting point alone can restore a little of the respect the GOP has lost. Perhaps then, they ll even be courageous enough to rejects the racists and the sexists and the Nazis, which will do more to grow the ranks of the party than the Southern Strategy ever did.And then the Republican Party can get past being a haven for extremists and anti-government zealots and get on the road to becoming a sane party with real ideas instead of simply opposing and obstructing at every turn, which has not been good for the country at all.America has lost its respect of the international community and our reputation has been seriously sullied. Letting Moore step inside the Senate would send a message to the world that America supports child molestation and the sexual assault and harassment of women.Such a message from the Republican Party smacks of hypocrisy. After all, we are talking about the same party that constantly bring up the sexual assault allegations against Bill Clinton.But just like how they constantly bring up Abraham Lincoln in an attempt to claim that the Republican Party must still be great, their rhetoric about Bill Clinton is old and tired and not really that relevant today. The GOP is far removed from the days of Lincoln. And Bill Clinton was president two decades ago and if he were running today he would not win. The sexual assault allegations alone would prevent him from even getting on the ballot.However, by supporting Donald Trump, who was accused by a dozen women of sexual assault during the 2016 campaign, Republicans committed a serious hypocrisy that undermines their Bill Clinton talking point.If Moore wins next month, Republicans will only be doubling down on that hypocrisy and they ll be past the point of no return. And the consequences will be severe.America is more diverse than ever before. Women have emerged as a force to be reckoned with after decades of old white guys running the show. Minorities are also set to become the majority of the population, and once that scale tips, the GOP will no longer be able to be the party of white people. It just won t work.It s just a matter of time, and time is running out for the Republican Party.And that s why they must rise above politics and stand for something bigger than themselves.Sexual assault and child molestation should not be rewarded with power and prestige. And that should go beyond the political arena as well, whether the behavior is coming from a corporate CEO or the part-owner of a website or a church leader or any other position of power.Republicans need to start practicing the  morality  they preach and they can do that by putting politics aside and do the right thing.That s what Republicans did in 1860 when they voted for a dark horse candidate as their flagbearer. Lincoln then put politics aside to assemble one of the greatest Cabinets in our history, bringing together liberal and conservative Republicans and even a Democrat or two.And even though Lincoln remained neutral at first and the politics of day made it really difficult, he made the decision to put politics aside and pushed for the passage of the 13th Amendment. Such a move at the time could have cost Lincoln a second term, but he did it anyway.Lincoln put principle over power in the face of an even more contentious and hateful political environment than we are experiencing today. It s time for Republicans to do the same now.Seven years ago, my first article for this site explained how Republicans have put power over principles for decades to the detriment of our progress towards a better future for everyone.Today, I want inform my loyal readers that this will be my final article for Addicting Info.It has been an honor and a privilege to write here for so many years. I must first thank my readers for making this job possible. Knowing that I was informing so many people across the country and around the world motivated me to make writing about politics my career. And now it is time to move on in order to further pursue that goal.It is hard to leave the best job one has ever had. Through the years, I have made friends and lost friends. I have been here through the struggles and the triumphs. And I have done that while drastically improving as a writer and a person along the way.With that being said, it is especially hard to leave the people I work with, and there are many, both past and present, who deserve a shout-out.

"November 27, 2017","Former reality show star Donald Trump just can t stop using a slur to describe Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) but this time he took things to the edge then crossed the line. On Monday, Trump referred to Warren as  Pocahontas  at an event honoring Native American  code talkers  who fought in World War II. Trump was literally surrounded by Native Americans when he hurled the slur. The chief. He s the general and the chief,  Trump said during the White House event, in reference to White House chief of staff John Kelly.  I said, how good were these code talkers? He said, sir, you have no idea. You have no idea how great they were, what they have done for this country and the strength and the bravery and the love for the country. So that was the ultimate statement from General Kelly, the importance,  Trump continued.  And I just want to thank you because you re very, very special people. You were here long before any of us were here, although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago, they call her Pocahontas.

"November 28, 2016","After being found competent to stand trial following a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, Dylann Roof has decided to ditch his attorneys and represent himself in the Charleston Massacre trial.Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court in Charleston declared Roof competent to stand on Friday. Jury selection had been put on hold for three weeks after the defense team asked the judge to declare Roof incompetent due to mental defect. But a psychiatric evaluation found that Roof was able to assist in his defense and understood the consequences of the proceedings. Therefore, under the law, he was ruled competent.On Monday, things took a surprise turn when Roof petitioned the court to allow him to represent himself. Gergel advised Roof against firing his legal team, which is led by David I. Bruck, a noted capital defense attorney. The judge asked the defendant a series of questions to make sure he understood the ramifications of his actions. But ultimately, after having found Roof competent, Gergel had no choice but to honor Roof s Sixth Amendment right to act as his own attorney. I do find the defendant has the personal capacity to self-representation,  Judge Gergel said.  I continue to believe it is strategically unwise, but it is a decision you have the right to make. Although Roof will be taking the lead role in his defense, Brock and the rest of his legal team will continue to serve as standby counsel.  Jury selection has since resumed.Roof is accused of killing nine African American people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., on June 17, 2015. He reportedly mingled with his victims for an hour, sitting in on their bible study where they welcomed him with open arms. He then began shouting racial slurs and pulled out a Glock pistol from his fanny pack. He opened fire on his unsuspecting victims, killing the pastor of the church, three other ministers and five other members of the congregation.Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, warned of the troubles defendants face when they represent themselves, especially if they have a mental illness. Key issues never get raised because the defendant knows nothing about the law,  said Dunham.  And often with mentally ill defendants whose murders were a product of their mental illness, they will attempt to justify their conduct instead of presenting evidence that their mental illness makes them less culpable. Abraham Lincoln said,  He who represents himself has a fool for a client.  While that may be true, it can also be particularly traumatic for the family when a defendant accused of slaughtering their loved ones is acting as his own attorney, as Dunham explained. When an emotionally disturbed defendant is permitted to cross-examine those witnesses and ask questions that may be based on a delusional view of reality, it only makes things worse,  Mr. Dunham said.Featured image via Grace Beahm-Pool/Getty Images", Dylann Roof Representing Himself In Charleston Massacre Trial After Court Decides He’s Sane

"November 29, 2016","Breitbart News, the right wing hate site that has been a huge booster of Donald Trump s campaign suffered a setback this week as major advertiser Kellogg s announced that they would no longer give their ad dollars to them.Kellogg s explained itself in a press release to Bloomberg: We regularly work with our media-buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren t aligned with our values as a company. We recently reviewed the list of sites where our ads can be placed and decided to discontinue advertising on Breitbart.com. We are working to remove our ads from that site. Breitbart is also connected to Trump through incoming White House counselor Steve Bannon, who served as the site s CEO. Bannon described Breitbart as the  platform for the alt-right,  using the public relations term for white nationalist anti-immigrant beliefs.Several Democratic senators and members of congress have expressed concerns about Bannon s ties to the site and the white nationalist message it promotes, arguing that these beliefs should not get the blessing of a senior member of White House staff on the public payroll.Over the years, Breitbart has pushed racist and Islamophobic content in order to further its right wing agenda. Founded by conservative activist Andrew Breitbart (who died of a heart attack), Breitbart has gleefully spread and popularized hateful content pandering to a conservative audience.In addition to the previously mentioned content, Breitbart has also embraced content attacking women s rights and has mocked gay rights. Several Breitbart writers and contributors are notorious for spreading hate, a stance which has not prevented Republican election officials from contributing op-eds to the site and appearing as interview subjects.Kellogg s is not the first advertiser to drop Breitbart for its hate ties, as other companies have severed their relationships rather than be connected to the content coming out of the gutter.Featured image via YouTube", Major Advertiser DROPS Breitbart For Racist Content

A backlash ensued after Trump retweeted three times from a woman who was convicted of a hate crime in the U.K.The current occupant of the White House is upset because British Prime Minister Theresa May responded to Trump s widely condemned retweets this morning, saying,  It is wrong for the president to have done this.  In a statement, Downing street further said,  Britain First seeks to divide communities by their use of hateful narratives that peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people. Members of British Parliament also condemned Trump s retweets.So naturally, Trump lashed out on Twitter at our ally s leader.

"November 3, 2017","The GOP Congress, with the approval of Donald Trump, is putting forth yet another tax bill that would take food off the tables of regular people so the wealthy can hoard even more money. You would think they would show a modicum of shame, that they would at least pretend that they are working for the voters, but this is the age of Trump and they are proud of the oligarchy they ve created. They are so proud they are literally saying, in front of reporters, that they don t care what the voters think about this wildly unpopular tax plan.Several polls have proven that tax cuts, especially tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, barely scratch the surface of Americans  concerns. It s hardly even a priority for brainwashed Republicans. Only about a quarter of Americans overall think tax reform should be a top priority, while barely half of Republicans (51 percent) think it should head the agenda.The majority of Americans have had it with the trickle down argument and they don t believe that a corporate tax cut will lead to more jobs.Some GOP selling points aren t sinking in. One of Republicans  biggest talking points is that a corporate tax cut will benefit workers (though even right-wing economists have cast doubt on White House estimates on this point).But nearly 60 percent of people believe corporations won t  use that money to create jobs,  according to the CBS poll. Likewise, approximately half of people in both the CBS and NBC/WSJ polls said they think the bill would grow the economy   a plurality but not a clear majority.Source: NPRScrew what voters think, at least that s the mindset of Republicans who know exactly who put them in office, the oligarchy. A Vox reporter confronted some GOP Congressmen about the tax bill that few people have seen and the most telling answer came from Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY), who in two words told us exactly what he thinks of his constituents  opinions:Others had answers the weren t quite as callous and were a bit more measured. They fell back on denial and Trump s  fake news  copout. I don t believe that poll,  stressed Texas Rep. Mike Conaway. I would love to see those polls, because those aren t polls of my constituents,  added Missouri Rep. Jason Smith.Golshan couldn t find a single Republican member of Congress who would acknowledge how unpopular the idea is with voters of passing a tax bill to let corporations pay even less of their fair share.Republicans need to work a little harder on their messaging of their pet tax bill. According to FiveThirtyEight.com, Republicans have a chance to pass their first major initiative since Trump took office, as long as they can get Americans to back it. So far, they are failing and their cavalier responses to Americans  concerns aren t helping. Of course, Collins might be right. As long as they have gerrymandering, voter suppression and Russia in their back pockets, voters  opinions might not actually matter.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images."," With Just Two Words, GOP Congressman ADMITS He Doesn’t Answer To His Constituents"
"November 30, 2016","The state of Michigan has, since the GOP takeover of 2010, been a petri dish for libertarian Republican policies, and nearly all of them have been complete and total failures.While most of the nation knows about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, in which the town s residents are drinking lead-filled water because Republicans insisted on changing the source of Flint s water in a money saving exercise.There have been fewer headlines about another of Michigan s experiments. People who occasionally need help from the government have long been demonized by Republicans. It s assumed that somehow, just because someone is poor, they are somehow pulling something on the rest of us. Clearly, that makes no sense at all, but the stereotype lives on. Most predominantly, Republicans insist that poor people must, just must, have substance abuse problems, so before being given the most paltry sustenance possible, they must be tested. That s what Michigan is doing. They are drug testing some welfare recipients. Guess how many positive results came up? None, not a single one.This wasn t done on a particularly large scale. Republicans passed a new law two years ago that allowed the state to drug test any welfare recipients that might be suspected of drug abuse. After the law passed, Michigan did one intelligent thing: they tested it. For one year beginning in October of 2015, they tested 27 potential substance abusers out of 443 welfare recipients.DHHS conducted the pilot in Allegan, Clinton and Marquette counties between Oct. 1, 2015, and Sept. 30, 2016, the report said.Although a total of 443 people in those counties were either receiving or applied for cash assistance during those 12 months, previous court decisions limited the actual drug-testing to individuals who failed a substance-abuse screening test.The report said that 27 of the 443 people were identified as potential substance-abusers. Of those 27, 10 were already getting treatment through Community Mental Health, three had their cases closed for other reasons and 14 went through the screening test.Source: Michigan LiveOne of those tested  was found by a clinician to have a reasonable suspicion of use of a controlled substance and require a substance use test.  The person agreed to the test, but the case, for some reason, was closed prior to the test. Not a single other person even raised a red flag.These results are hardly surprising. In states where they have enacted drug testing for welfare recipients, the results have been similar.It s doubtful these results will do much. Republicans feel that poor people must be punished, that any assistance must be micromanaged, while corporate welfare needs no oversight whatsoever.In 2015, despite lack of evidence that programs in other states accomplished their goals, three more states have implemented similar regimes. And a ThinkProgress survey of the 10 states that now have these programs in place found that they continue to be expensive and not especially effective. All told, states spent another $850,909.25 on the testing regimes in 2015 to uncover just 321 positive tests in more than one state, none at all.This came after a February 2015 ThinkProgress examination of the seven states that had implemented drug testing programs for TANF applicants and/or recipients. At that time, those states had spent about $1 million to create and implement a complicated system of screening and urine testing and found just 407 drug users.In other words, this supposedly fiscally conservative position is not at all about saving money. It s expensive and punitive. But hey, it s Trump s America, where being an unscrupulous billionaire gets you the presidency and being legitimately poor labels you a criminal.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images", Michigan Has Been Drug Testing Welfare Recipients; You Won’t Believe How Many Tested Positive
"November 30, 2017","In Michigan, the upcoming election in 2018 presents voters with an interesting option: They could, for the first time, have an all-female  ticket  for every major office being contested. Senator Debbie Stabenow is up for re-election, and odds are good that the nominees for Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State will all be women.At least one of those candidates thinks that s a very good thing. Democratic candidate for AG Dana Nessel has produced a campaign ad that capitalizes on the benefits of being female when it comes to running for public office. Namely, the fact that she doesn t have a d*ck to wave at every passerby.With the wave of allegations over the last few weeks, beginning with the outing of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein as a total pervert and a sexual predator, it seems like everywhere you look there s someone else being ousted from their position or job for having at least acted like a pig   and in some cases the allegations are even worse.Of course, not everyone is suffering from the paradigm shift that has stoked bravery in women across America and around the world. The highest office in the country is, of course, occupied by a man who s been accused by at least 19 women of everything from sexual harassment to actual inappropriate physical touching. And the open US Senate seat in Alabama is currently being contested by, on the Democratic side, the guy who successfully prosecuted the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham that killed four young black girls, and on the Republican side, a guy who s accused of pursuing, dating, and touching teenage girls as young as 14 when he was an Assistant District Attorney in his 30 s.Dana Nessel wants to help you avoid all of that unseemly contact with potentially predatory men by simply not being one: [W]hen you re choosing Michigan s next attorney general, ask yourself this: Who can you trust most not to show you their penis in a professional setting?

"November 4, 2016","Sometimes it takes a wolf to catch a snake.Rudy Giuliani has been making the media rounds over the last two days, bragging that he knew about FBI Director James Comey s letter two days before it went public.That means Giuliani has been getting inside information from the supposedly non-partisan Federal Bureau of Investigation that he has likely been passing on to Donald Trump, which means the FBI appears to be colluding with Trump s campaign to sabotage Hillary Clinton.And during an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN Friday night, Giuliani was cornered over it because the only way he could possibly get such information is if a current FBI agent is passing information to him personally, or through someone else. No, I ve spoken to no current FBI agents,  Giuliani claimed when asked by Blitzer.  Gosh, in the last eight months, nine months, ten months, certainly not about this. Then Giuliani claimed that everything he has been hearing is just hearsay. But that apparently has not stopped him from spewing the  hearsay  on Fox News and elsewhere in an effort to smear Hillary Clinton. So, I ve had lots of conversations with them and they have told me a lot about the   I guess the disagreement between the Justice Department on the one hand and the FBI on the other. But it all comes from former FBI agents and it s all hearsay. But that s hard to believe since Giuliani claimed that he knew about Comey s letter two days in advance and that letter was actually released. It was not hearsay.Blitzer then hit Giuliani with a statement written by Democratic congressmen accusing him of obtaining leaked information from FBI agents.The statement reads: This morning Rudy Giuliani, one of Donald Trump s closest and most vocal campaign advisers, appeared on national television and confirmed that he had obtained leaked information about the FBI s review of Clinton-related e-mails several days before FBI Director James Comey sent his letter to Congress last Friday about this letter. In fact, Mr. Giuliani went even further and bragged about the information that he had obtained stating,  Did I hear about it? You re darn right I heard about it. Again, the only way Giuliani could have heard about this is if a current FBI agent leaked the information to him or passed it to him through someone else. Either way, the FBI has a serious breach that is being used to help Donald Trump. That s not correct,  Giuliani responded.  I ve had no conversations with anyone inside the FBI. I have heard for the last four months a tremendous amount of information about the consternation within the FBI, the fact that FBI agents were very unhappy about the way they were being treated by the Justice Department. But none of it came from any current   I haven t talked to a current FBI agent. So Giuliani just admitted that he is getting this information from former agents who are getting the information from current agents.Blitzer actually got Giuliani to claim that he didn t know that Comey was going to release the information he did, and that it came as a surprise, but Giuliani did an about-face only seconds later and said it wasn t a surprise. Seriously, Blitzer did a great job of getting Giuliani to tie himself in knots.The former NYC mayor then repeated his alleged  hearsay  once again by claiming that he has heard from his sources that FBI agents are angry at the Justice Department for not indicting Hillary Clinton, despite the fact that Director Comey recommended that charges were not warranted.Giuliani then claimed that he read articles about it somewhere, but didn t specify where the articles came from and said he s not sure if they are true.So Giuliani claims that he is talking to former FBI agents, and that what he has heard is merely hearsay that he spreads anyway as if it s the truth, and then he claims that he read this information in articles even though he doesn t know if what he is reading is the truth, and he still repeats it to anyone within earshot.And Wolf Blitzer drove a stake through the heart of Giuliani s bullshit by asking one question. But let me ask you a question, Mayor. If you don t know it s true, why are you suggesting it? Why are you going on national television talking about these issues if you don t know it s true? Giuliani once again touted his FBI sources, only to then be informed by Blitzer that FBI agents sign a form agreeing to never reveal information about investigations and that they have a responsibility to not leak information to people like Giuliani.Here s the video via YouTube.[ad3media campaign= 1302 ]The FBI should be thoroughly investigated by the Justice Department to find out who is leaking information to a private citizen who also happens to be a surrogate for a presidential candidate who will do anything to smear his opponent in an effort to win the election. This is a major breach within the FBI and it definitely looks like the FBI is working with Republicans to persecute Hillary Clinton.

It would be unprecedented, but he is interfering with the government s right to a fair trial. Akerman was responding to Trump s decision to blast George Papadopoulos, who tried to arrange meetings between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials (including between Putin and Trump), and is now working with the FBI as a cooperating witness. Trump called him a  low-level volunteer  who had  already proven to be a liar,  in his typically pathetic attempt to distance himself from those who are incriminating to him.He then repeated his calls for the Department of Justice to investigate Hillary Clinton, the Democrats, and basically anybody who isn t him or has anything to do with him. His calls for the DOJ to investigate people who ve pissed him off has drawn widespread criticism from legal professionals and analysts.The Fake President is also upset with the fact that he can t control what the DOJ does. He doesn t want an independent Justice Department   he wants a department that will go after who he tells them to go after: The saddest thing is, because I am the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department.

He blocks everyone s views of Bob while screaming,  BOOOOO!  and says he doesn t like Bob. When the boss asks why, he shouts,  Because you chose him!

In the wake of the mass shooting at a church in Texas, we ve all heard the obligatory  thoughts and prayers  and  May God be with yous,  we ve come to expect from Republicans who are more concerned about their NRA ratings than they are about actual lives. So Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut blasted them for it in his official statement on the shooting.In it, he asks a very, very important question: How can you claim that you respect human life while choosing fealty to weapons-makers over support for measures favored by the vast majority of your constituents? This is something he wants each of his Republican colleagues to consider seriously as they go to sleep tonight, because many of these people (like Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan) claim to value human life in the abortion debate, but behave as though the deaths of thousands of people already here on this Earth due to gun violence is simply the price of freedom. That s not valuing life. That s valuing the money they get from various lobbies.Murphy went on to state his heartbreak, not just over high-profile mass shootings, but others as well: My heart breaks for Sutherland Springs. Just like it still does for Las Vegas. And Orlando. And Charleston. And Aurora. And Blacksburg. And Newtown. Just like it does every night for Chicago. And New Orleans. And Baltimore. And Bridgeport. Then he ended it with quite possibly the most powerful statement there is: The terrifying fact is that no one is safe so long as Congress chooses to do absolutely nothing in the face of this epidemic. The time is now for Congress to shed its cowardly cover and do something. Congress continually fails to act because Republicans won t. So while Murphy diplomatically says that we aren t safe because Congress is too cowardly to act, he s laying the blame for this squarely at his Republican colleagues  feet. The saddest part is that the GOP won t heed this. The gun lobby will have to be shut down one way or another for Republicans to open their eyes to reality. You can read his full statement below:Whoa, this statement from @ChrisMurphyCT on the Sutherland Springs, Texas shooting is extremely powerful.

"November 6, 2016","Assuming Hillary Clinton wins Tuesday s election, as she s predicted to do, she will owe at least part of her success to the Senate Minority Leader and Senior Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid.Nevada, which is a traditional red state, is a tossup this year. FiveThirtyEight shows both Donald Trump and Clinton in a statistical near tie, but early voting trends seem to be putting the race firmly in Clinton s camp. This is especially good news for Clinton because if she wins Nevada s six electoral votes, it will mean that she can still afford to lose Florida and North Carolina. Trump won t (and doesn t) have that luxury. If Clinton does win, that will be Reid s doing:Yet about one thing Trump was right: Harry Reid built this. After two years of boosting voter registration among key Democratic demographics, the retiring Senate minority leader has brought turnout among Hispanics in the state to record levels. In doing so, he s almost surely delivered the state for Hillary Clinton and possibly with it the presidential race (Trump has only the narrowest path to 270 electoral votes without Nevada). The reality of this election is that if Clinton wins, especially if she ends up needing Nevada, it s not a stretch to declare that Reid was the single most important person in her victory.Source: PoliticoTrump is complaining about the turnout of Latino voters, but he has no one to blame but himself. His campaign began by attacking Mexican immigrants and calling them  rapists  and  drug dealers,  and it expanded into an all out attack on immigrants. Then, there was the judge he said couldn t be partial since he was  Mexican.  The judge isn t. He s Mexican-American. Or, there are Trump s attacks on Univision s Jorge Ramos. The list could go on, but it s cost Trump big. Clinton has the support of 3/4 of Latinos and Trump has the lowest approval rating among Latinos than anyone in more than 30 years.Reid s ground operation exploited the fear and loathing of Trump to the max, and the early results bear it out: Whereas the Latino vote was 15 percent of the Nevada electorate in 2008 and 18 percent in 2012, data I have seen shows now it is up 30 percent from 2012 in early voting, meaning it could go above 20 percent of all voters by Tuesday evening. We ve been focused on registering and building our Latino turnout from Day 1,  said one Democratic organizer.  That is paying dividends with Latino turnout up in the early vote and potentially up overall. In five out of the six highest Hispanic precincts, turnout in the early vote exceeded  12. Right now, Nevada appears almost un-winnable for Trump. If he loses, that will pretty much seal his fate. As for Reid, well, he will no longer be in office and the Senate race in Nevada is a squeaker, but it s hard to imagine that if Hillary walks away with the state in her pocket, so will Cortez Masto, the Democratic poised to replace Reid.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.

"November 6, 2017","Fox News has decided to cancel certain ads on their network, completing their transition from a conservative network into a safe space for their fragile Trump fans, and after Trump himself threw a livid fit. A series of ads by political activist Tom Steyer, which call for Trump s impeachment, has been pulled because of the reaction to it from their viewers. Seriously: Due to the strong negative reaction to their ad by our viewers, we could not in good conscience take their money. Why, because their viewers will abandon the network if they show any signs of trying to be balanced? Of course, Fox News is a private entity and is allowed to do this, but the question remains: Is it censorship if they did so because of pressure from Trump? The unhinged presidential impostor did go on Twitter to call Steyer  wacky & totally unhinged  when the  Impeach Trump  campaign was first launched in late October.

His lawyer, Brad Deutsch, said that, on Oct. 27, Fox had agreed unconditionally to air the ads for one more week.

"November 7, 2016","Just hours before the presidential election, President Obama gave a powerful speech at Hillary Clinton s final campaign rally in Philadelphia. Taking full advantage of this last opportunity to appeal to voters, the president gave his final plea to Americans before they choose his successor. I know it s been a long campaign. There s been a lot of noise, and a lot of distraction,  he said. At times, it s felt more like a reality show, or even a parody,  Obama continued.  But tomorrow, tomorrow, Philadelphia, the choice you face when you step into that voting booth could not be clearer and could not be more serious. Obama explained that Trump is completely and totally unqualified to serve as president.  Don t take my word for it, listen to the Republicans who refuse to support him,  the president said.  He lacks a basic understanding of the world. The commander in chief joked again about Trump s aides revoking his Twitter privileges, but at the same time, he made a very good point. Over the weekend, his campaign took away his Twitter account because he s erratic,  Obama said.  If his closest advisors won t trust him to tweet, why would any of us trust him with the nuclear codes? Obama then gave one final endorsement of the Democratic nominee.  You don t have to just vote against someone, you have someone outstanding to vote for in Hillary Clinton,  Obama exclaimed. Hillary, he said, will do whatever it takes to deliver on her campaign promises and make life better for the American people.  She will work. She will deliver. She won t just tweet,  the president said.Watch President Obama s speech in its entirety, here:[ad3media campaign= 1325 ]Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images", President Obama Gives Powerful Speech At Hillary Clinton Rally On Eve Of Election (VIDEO)

Desiree Fairooz (@desireefairooz) November 6, 2017She laughed because she felt Senator Shelby s overly-syrupy remarks about Sessions alleged record of treating everyone equally were as ridiculous as they sound. Sessions treats people anything but equally and he has a long track record of that. Code Pink s campaign director said Fairooz  laughter was a reflex action more than anything, which actually does make a lot of sense. Fairooz herself didn t mean to actually laugh, but she did say: I felt it was my responsibility as a citizen to dissent at the confirmation hearing of Senator Jeff Sessions, a man who professes anti-immigrant, anti-LGBT policies, who has voted against several civil rights measures and who jokes about the white supremacist terrorist group the Ku Klux Klan. That s the whole problem, though: The Trump administration doesn t want dissent. And while it s true that Fairooz had several prior arrests for protesting, the number of cases publicly brought against dissenters of this administration is absolutely astonishing.

If the world economy takes a major hit and consequently hurts this country and erases all of the progress we have made since the Great Recession eight years ago, Republicans will OWN this. It will be their fault and they will be the only ones to blame.This election is a seriously embarrassing moment in our history and our reputation around the world just went from one of respect to a total joke.These conservative voters in rural areas just got duped into thinking that this billionaire blowhard actually cares about them, their families, their jobs, and their financial future. But they are about to be severely disappointed because Trump only cares about himself. He does not care about making sure people get a fair wage. He does not care about all those blue-collar workers who somehow think Trump will bring back manufacturing jobs. This is a guy who imports materials from China because he d rather buy cheap instead of buying from American companies.So if you are a conservative and you lose your job, home, and savings.

"November 8, 2017","For the last several months, liberals have been watching the news with frustration over Congress  apparent Keystone Cop incompetency in its investigation of the Trump administration ties to Russia. The Senate has been somewhat better than the House, but still, we are pinning most of our hopes on special counsel Robert Mueller, until now.In a bombshell report in the Daily Beast, it was revealed that Senate Democrats are going behind the backs of Republicans and running their own investigation.According to the report, Senate Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee have been secretly investigating the Trump/Russia connections with hope of making them public soon:Sean Bartlett, a Democratic spokesman for the committee, called the report a  major  effort to expose how Vladimir Putin s government has kept  the Russian public supportive of wars abroad, while distracted from the regime s criminality and corruption at home, and how, over the past decade-plus, it has adapted that toolkit and taken it global.  The report, he added,  describes how these efforts are led by the government s security services and buttressed by state-owned enterprises, Kremlin-aligned oligarchs, and Russian criminal groups that have effectively been nationalized by the state.  It traces how the operations  emanate out of Russia in concentric geographic circles: they began in Russia, expanded to its periphery and former satellites, and then into the rest of Europe and eventually, the United States. It s not completely secret. According to the committee s chairman, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), they know about the investigation, but they have no idea what the Democrats have found. The Democrats would like Republicans to get on board, though.The investigation isn t just about Trump. It s broader, and it explores all of Russia s sins dating back years. They are investigating issues as varied as cheating in the Olympics and Russia s attacks on Soviet Bloc countries, including its illegal annexation of Crimea.That doesn t mean they aren t investigating Trump. As one member of a Republican think tank said: It s not about Trump, but the impact will be:  Hey Mr. President, here s a list of 55 sins of the Russians, and you re kissing Putin s ass   what s the deal?'

"November 9, 2016","Now that he s president-elect, Donald Trump has begun turning his attention to his transition, as well as beginning to build up his cabinet. It s early right now, but sources have told Politico who is in line for some top positions. If you weren t already panicking just from his win last night, now would be a good time to start.Perhaps most alarming are his potential picks for Secretary of DHS. Politico reports that Sheriff David Clarke is said to be a major contender. This is the Milwaukee sheriff who made a name for himself calling for  pitchforks and torches  and armed rebellion if Trump lost.But he seems to be the main contender, not the sole contender. There s also a possibility that Bridgegate Kingpin Chris Christie could be in line for the position, as could Rudy Giuliani. Putting either of these people in charge of agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and more, could potentially be very damaging.For Secretary of State, we have John Bolton, former U.N. ambassador and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Bolton was a controversial figure at the U.N., and he championed George W. Bush s insistence on one-sided foreign policy. Fan-bloody-tastic.Newt Gingrich could also be in line for this position, as could Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee.Trump is rumored to want to put his own finance chief, who s a former Goldman-Sachs exec, in as Secretary of the Treasury. Besides the blatant cronyism, a Wall Street executive in a cabinet position goes against everything Trump claimed about Hillary and her ties to the banks.Rudy Giuliani is rumored to be considered for a host of positions, including Attorney General, White House Chief of Staff, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence/CIA Director. Giuliani is about as erratic and unreasonable as Trump   the most benign position in this list is probably Chief of Staff.Chris Christie may also be up for Attorney General.Trump s top pick for Secretary of Energy is Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm. This guy has shaped a lot of Trump s ideas on energy policy, which includes gutting renewable energy and escalating fossil fuel use.For Secretary of the Interior, the leading candidate right now is Forrest Lucas, the founder of Lucas Oil. An oil executive and a vocal animal rights opponent is such a great pick to protect our lands and our wildlife. We can probably say goodbye to national parks, the endangered species list, and more if he s chosen.Other candidates include none other than Queen Drunken Airhead herself, Sarah Palin, as well as Trump s own son, Donald Trump Jr. No nepotism there at all.Trump wants a business leader, a.k.a. a CEO, for Labor Secretary. Interestingly enough, though, the current commissioner of the EEOC, Victoria Lipnic, is said to be a frontrunner for this job. She s one of Obama s picks and supports things like the Equal Pay Act. She wants to get rid of the EEOC s pay data collection system, though.Trump said early on that he wanted to eliminate the EPA, but has since modified that position. However, he wants to put noted climate skeptic Myron Ebell in charge of the agency responsible for ensuring we have clean air and clean water, so he might as well eliminate it.Ben Carson.  Nuff said.Politico has their full list, and CNN also has a list. It s very early yet, and it s true that not every single person Trump is considering would be a bad choice. For instance, he wants someone who s already got a lot of experience with Veterans  Affairs to head up the VA. However, many of his potential picks are rampant with cronyism and just plain sheer idiocy and cluelessness.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Trump Is Already Mulling His Cabinet Picks And It’s Clear He Has No Idea What He’s Doing

Is anyone else out there as offended by this as we are?Jones first argued that, while the tent of the Democratic Party is diverse, it is not as inclusive as it could be. Right now I don t see Democrats looking at the situation and saying, you know what, maybe we drew our circle too small,  Jones said.  I love that we re hugging LGBT and Muslims and all the people who usually don t get a hug. We re hugging them, but maybe we need a bigger hug, and include some of those folks in Appalachia. That s exactly what the DNC chair said,  co-host Sunny Hostin insisted.  We had Tom Perez on the show, and that s exactly what he said. They are trying to do that,  co-host Joy Behar affirmed. Listen, there may be some leaders who are. Unfortunately, and I have to be honest I get in trouble because I m honest,  Jones said. I know you do,  Hostin interjected. When I listen to liberals, when they re not on TV trying to make it sound good, we re still in grief; we re still mad,  Jones said.  And we re not just mad at Trump, who we should be mad at. We re mad at every single person who voted for Trump, even people who have no jobs, even coal miners who have black lung disease and who are dying and Democrats don t have anything to say about it for years. Behar and co-host Whoopi Goldberg interrupted Jones to take issue with the idea that liberals are mad at Trump voters, asking Jones specifically who he was talking about. Jones explained his point of view comes from conversations with liberals. In my conversations with liberals, it s like  they,   those  Trump voters,  them.   I don t understand how those people could ever do that.  In America, we don t have to agree. We have to try to understand,  he said.Via: WFB",VAN JONES Tells ‘Mad’ Liberals To Go Hug Trump Voters in Appalachia To Win Elections [Video]

Eleven states allow illegal aliens to get driver s licenses.In California, state officials  specifically chose not to make noncitizen license holders searchable in their DMV database,  said True the Vote spokesman Logan Churchwell, who called the newly signed bill  unprecedented. The measure, Assembly Bill 1461,  will effectively change the form of governance in California from a Republic whose elected officials are determined by United States citizens and will guarantee that noncitizens will participate in all California elections going forward,  Election Integrity Project of California President Linda Paine said in a statement.It appears to be unconstitutional.This is what conservatives were afraid of and this is just one more example of a conspiracy theory come true.

How could she possibly give that up? The power and the money are just too hard to pass up for retirement. The on;y problem is that sudden;y Feinstein has challengers How dare they try and dethrone the powerhouse Senator who was once the Mayor of San Francisco Game on!A potential primary challenger to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) is signaling his intent to enter the race for the Senate seat she has held since 1992.California Democratic state senate president Kevin de Le n will throw his hat into the ring to challenge Feinstein in the 2018 race, according to three sources who spoke to CNN. The 84-year-old senator announced Monday she would run for reelection, causing consternation on the progressive left even as she tried to get out ahead of de Le n.In the state senate, de Le n represents Los Angeles and has helped pass measures directed at President Donald Trump, positioning himself as one of the president s fiercest critics. The California state legislature has opposed Trump s agenda by becoming a so-called sanctuary state, as well as trying to force him to release his tax returns and even passing a resolution calling for him to apologize for  racist and bigoted behavior. Feinstein, however, took criticism from the left in August for expressing the hope that Trump would change to be more cooperative with Democrats. I just hope he has the ability to learn and to change, and if he does, he can be a good president,  she said, receiving boos from the San Francisco audience. She later said she is  under no illusion that it s likely to happen and will continue to oppose his policies. De Le n will likely be one of multiple contenders for Feinstein s seat. A source said Democratic mega-donor and environmentalist Tom Steyer is  very much looking at the Senate race,  and in a letter Wednesday he also called on Democrats to impeach Trump.California has an open primary in which the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, face off in the general election.

This is a shockingly weird claim, but it shouldn t be surprising.In an editorial published last month, we wrote about the Left s effort to broaden the boundaries of concepts such as white supremacy and racism in a way that impugns the conduct of well-meaning people. Now, a feminist nonprofit is running a campaign to convince festive imbibers of Pumpkin Spice Lattes they re unknowingly boosting the cause of white supremacy.The co-founder of UltraViolet issued the  shot of racism  statement Sept. 6. I knew Starbucks had a secret menu, but the baristas must really be keeping these racism shots on the down low.A social media post from the group informed readers:  That favorite fall drink of yours is funding rent payments to white supremacy. Given the severity of the campaign s language, one may assume profits from sales of Starbucks  beloved PSLs are being surreptitiously redirected to the Klan or neo-Nazi groups. In fact, UltraViolet s actual complaint is that a couple of Starbucks  24,000 locations happen to be in properties owned by the Trump Organization.According to UltraViolet s logic, by patronizing any of Starbucks  thousands of stores, average consumers of the signature fall beverage are directly boosting the cause of white supremacy.

"Oct 14, 2016","Every day we hear of more voter fraud being uncovered across the United States. This is nothing new and every election we read about more and more early voter fraud being committed. When will Republicans stop cowering to threats of  racism  and voter suppressions levied by the very people who are stealing our votes?There s a mere four weeks left to go before the presidential election, and the allegations of voter fraud just. Keep. Coming.The Kankakee Daily Journal, a local newspaper in a county just south of Chicago, reported last week that several citizens in the small county reported they were offered bribes in return for casting votes for Democrats. Voting officials were also looking into reports that some mail-in voter applications had been filed from outside the county.From the article:The Kankakee County State s Attorney s office says it is investigating possible voting fraud after the clerk s office reported three complaints from people who said they were offered bribes for votes.In a news release issued late Tuesday afternoon, Jamie Boyd, the state s attorney, also said  several  vote-by-mail applications seem to have come from people living outside of Kankakee County. This unprecedented action was taken in response to reports of individuals from Chicago offering gifts to potential voters in exchange for a vote for Kate Cloonen, Hillary Clinton and others,  Boyd said in the news release.  Our office takes seriously the obligation to protect the rights of citizens to vote for the candidate of their choice, and to do so without undue influence from special interest groups. The investigation will also focus on the authenticity of vote by mail requests. Several applications have been filed with the election authority that appear to be fraudulently executed. The report closely followed allegations of voter fraud in Virginia, where at least 20 dead people were illegally registered to vote by a James Madison student working for a local voter registration group called HarrisonburgVOTES. The Washington Free Beacon reported the group is run by one Joe Fitzgerald, the chairman of his local Democratic Committee, and that the student, Andrew Spieles, is also a registered Democrat.Additionally, the Virginia Voters Alliance and the Public Interest Legal Foundation found that at least 1,046 non-U.S. citizens across eight districts had voted in the 2012 presidential election.

Corey s brave admission of his experiences in Hollywood should have been treated as a public service announcement for parents who had child actors working in Hollywood, as he was giving them a  heads up  to take the extra steps to protect them. Instead, he was shamed Feldman appeared in a 2103 episode of The View where Barbara Walters and Star Jones went out of their way to discredit and shut him up. I m saying there are people that were the people that did this to both me and Corey [Haim] that are still working. They re still out there, and that are some of the richest most powerful people in this business. Walters tried to interupt, but Feldman continued,  And they do not want me saying what I am saying right now. Walters asked Feldman,  Are you saying they are pedophiles  and that they are still in this business?  Feldman replied,  Yes. Feldman went on to say,  They don t want me here right now. They want me dead! Star Jones quickly jumped in to try to shut Feldman up so he doesn t scare parents who want their kids in the industry.Feldman clarified, that he s just warning parents to  be careful what you wish for. Don t go into it with naivety.  Instead of considering Feldman s warning, that may be of interest to parents who have children in the industry, Walters interrupted him to admonish him,  You re damaging an entire industry!

"Oct 15, 2017","Apparently, Kimmel s okay with throwing half of his audience away over his uncontrollable hate for Donald Trump and his supporters. The big question is, will parent company ABC be okay with Kimmel insulting, and driving 50% of his audience away?Late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel said he would perform the same emotionally-charged monologues about healthcare and gun violence  again in a heartbeat,  despite a drastic reduction in Republican viewership of his show. Three years ago, I was equally liked by Republicans and Democrats,  Kimmel told CBS   Sunday Morning  of  Jimmy Kimmel Live!  which has aired on ABC since 2003.  And then Republican numbers went way down, like 30 percent, or whatever. And you know, as a talk show host, that s not ideal but I would do it again in a heartbeat. Kimmel earned high praise and sharp rebukes for his foray into the healthcare debate in September, an issue that became particularly important to the comic after his six-month-old son Billy was born with a rare congenital heart defect.He also garnered similar reactions when he choked up during a monologue imploring Congress to act on gun control in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre earlier in October.Critics like conservative commentator Ben Shapiro have slammed Kimmel for parading as a  moral arbiter. I m not. I mean, I agree with him. I m nobody s moral arbiter,  Kimmel told CBS.  You don t have to watch the show. You don t have to listen to what I say. A defiant Kimmel added that he doesn t say  I don t mind  because he preferred  everyone with a television to watch the show.

Chicago politics at its best Hillary Clinton could be prosecuted in federal court for failing to tell President Barack Obama about her private email server at the time she was running it, according to a veteran FBI agent. Obama said flatly during a  60 Minutes  interview on Sunday that  No,  he did not know Clinton sidestepped security protocols with her a home-brew email setup while she was his secretary of state.The FBI agent who spoke with DailyMail.com has had a 20-year career in federal law enforcement and serves in a supervisory capacity in a domestic FBI field office.He said on Friday that failing to put Obama in the loop could be enough to send her to prison for ten years. Via:Daily MailEver since he opined that the police had  acted stupidly  prior to the infamous and embarrassing  beer summit , Obama has shown himself eager to interfere with ongoing investigations for political reasons. When thuglet Trayvon Martin provided an good example of why jumping and beating down a stranger is a bad evolutionary strategy, Obama jumped on the race-baiting bandwagon saying if he had a son, that son would look like Martin. When the Justice Department was looking into the illegal use of the IRS to harass opponents of the administration, Obama said  there is not even a smidgen of corruption.  When deserter and failed turncoat Bowe Bergdahl was released by the Taliban, Obama had his hippie parents over for a Rose Garden ceremony even though he was known at the time to be a deserter. Now Obama has interjected himself into the investigation into the fate of top secret documents illegally stored on Hillary Clinton s private server. From his 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft on October 11:Steve Kroft: Do you think it posed a national security problem?President Barack Obama: I don t think it posed a national security problem. I think that it was a mistake that she has acknowledged and  you know, as a general proposition, when we re in these offices, we have to be more sensitive and stay as far away from the line as possible when it comes to how we handle information, how we handle our own personal data. And, you know, she made a mistake. She has acknowledged it. I do think that the way it s been ginned-up is in part because of  in part  because of politics. And I think she d be the first to acknowledge that maybe she could have handled the original decision better and the disclosures more quickly. But Steve Kroft: What was your reaction when you found out about it?President Barack Obama: This is one of those issues that I think is legitimate, but the fact that for the last three months this is all that s been spoken about is an indication that we re in presidential political season.Steve Kroft: Do you agree with what President Clinton has said and Secretary Clinton has said, that this is not  not that big a deal. Do you agree with that?President Barack Obama: Well, I m not going to comment on Steve Kroft: You think it s not that big a deal President Barack Obama: What I think is that it is important for her to answer these questions to the satisfaction of the American public. And they can make their own judgment. I can tell you that this is not a situation in which America s national security was endangered.Steve Kroft: This administration has prosecuted people for having classified material on their private computers.President Barack Obama: Well, I  there s no doubt that there had been breaches, and these are all a matter of degree. We don t get an impression that here there was purposely efforts  on  in  to hide something or to squirrel away information. But again, I m gonna leave it to This can only be seen as an attempt by Obama to tell the federal prosecutors who will ultimately decide what, if any, charges should be made in this case that there is nothing to see here:Those statements angered F.B.I. agents who have been working for months to determine whether Ms. Clinton s email setup had in fact put any of the nation s secrets at risk, according to current and former law enforcement officials.Investigators have not reached any conclusions about whether the information on the server had been compromised or whether to recommend charges, according to the law enforcement officials. But to investigators, it sounded as if Mr. Obama had already decided the answers to their questions and cleared anyone involved of wrongdoing.The White House quickly backed off the president s remarks and said Mr. Obama was not trying to influence the investigation. But his comments spread quickly, raising the ire of officials who saw an instance of the president trying to influence the outcome of a continuing investigation   and not for the first time.A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment. But Ron Hosko, a former senior F.B.I. official who retired in 2014 and is now the president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, said it was inappropriate for the president to  suggest what side of the investigation he is on  when the F.B.I. is still investigating. Injecting politics into what is supposed to be a fact-finding inquiry leaves a foul taste in the F.B.I. s mouth and makes them fear that no matter what they find, the Justice Department will take the president s signal and not bring a case,  said Mr. Hosko, who maintains close contact with current agents.Several current and former law enforcement officials, including those close to the investigation, expressed similar sentiments in separate interviews over several days. Most, however, did so only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case.Contrary to what Hillary s campaign is saying, we now have it on pretty good authority that the FBI is conducting an investigation under the part of the Espionage Act that pertains to gross negligence in the handling of Defense information. That information, at a minimum, is the two Top Secret Keyhole satellite derived documents discovered by the Intelligence Community IG though it could be any of the over 400 emails containing classified information that have been uncovered so far.(f) Whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information, relating to the national defense, (1) through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer  Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.

"Oct 18, 2017","Thanks to one very brave journalist and filmmaker, FERGUSON, a very important and extremely controversial play, is set to begin in New York City on October 19 and will run through October 30th.The New York version of FERGUSON is directed by Jerry Dixon.Much like the contentious real-life drama that played out on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, when Michael Brown was shot dead by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, filmmaker Phelim McAleer s controversial retelling of what really happened that fateful day in the Ferguson the play, using only the Grand Jury testimony from the Officer Wilson trial, is sure to ruffle some feathers.Black Lives Matter has been perpetuating a lie about Michael Brown and how he was a victim of murder at the hands of a white police officer, who had no grounds whatsoever to shoot him.FERGUSON is a Verbatim Play   it only uses actual Grand Jury testimony from eyewitnesses who saw police officer Daren Wilson shoot Michael Brown. Most of these eyewitnesses are minorities and yet their accounts are totally at odds with the stories spun by the mainstream media and activists.This is why it is so important to bring the truth to New York. Obviously the New York theatrical establishment won t support this play. They seem to really detest anything that challenges their cozy consensus world view.Ferguson the play, was the brainchild of journalist and filmmaker Phelim McAleer, who many know for his hard-hitting documentary Fracknation, that pulled the curtain back on a false narrative being pushed by liberal activists and politicians, and exposed the truth behind the lies Americans were being told about the dangers of fracking.Two years ago, when rehearsal began in Los Angeles for FERGUSON, McAleer found himself having to deal with 9 actors who walked out when rehearsals began, after reading the script (that is based on the verbatim Grand Jury testimony of the witnesses during the officer Wilson trial).What makes FERGUSON so compelling, is that not one word of the Grand Jury testimony is altered or changed. McAleer, who was determined to keep the show alive, explains how difficult it has been to get his play to the New York stage:McAleer tells viewers in the promotional video below, that the truth about what really happened in Ferguson is not what the mainstream media s been telling you.:  The truth was so shocking to so many people, that 9 of the cast walked out during rehearsals in Los Angeles. I was determined that the show would go on, even though the cast walked out. And the cast walked out because what they wanted to believe, didn t match the truth that was in the  Grand Jury documents. They were so convinced by the media, of one version of events, and the truth didn t matter to them, and they couldn t handle it. So that s why it s so important to bring this to New York. Phelim goes on to remind viewers of how Mike Pence was attacked by the cast and audience when he went to see Hamilton in New York.Despite the 9 members of the cast who walked out on the play in Los Angeles and the anger the play incited in many supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement, FERGUSON was very well-received by critics after its debut in Los Angeles.Watch:Phelim McAleer is asking for help to fund his FERGUSON production. Please consider making a contribution to this very worthy cause by clicking HERE to donate.FERGUSON  made for a riveting spectacle and comes as a reminder both of the adversarial dramatic power that is inherent in any courtroom testimony and how even the dry language of a legal transcript can come alive when placed in the hands of skilled actors. Add a standing-room-only audience and the high stakes of this country s ongoing debate about race, police profiling and its use of lethal force, and you ve got the ingredients for an incendiary evening of theater.  -LA WEEKLYHopefully, FERGUSON the play will cause Americans to understand what really happened in Ferguson through the eyes of the people who testified to what they actually saw that day and not through the lies of the mainstream media and the false narrative of Black Lives Matter leaders and activists.",ONE BRAVE MAN Is About To Reveal The Truth About What REALLY Happened In Ferguson…Black Lives Matter and The Media Are NOT Going To Be Happy [VIDEO]

"Oct 19, 2016","Dear Barack Obama, please don t tell me voter fraud isn t possible in a state where the Governor and Secretary of State are Republicans. I live in the very blue state of Michigan where both offices are held by Republicans and I beg to differ I was a poll challenger in the city of Pontiac, MI in 2012 and again, in 2014. The video below is an interview I did with Dennis Michael Lynch where I discuss the unbelievable corrupt behavior by the poll supervisor and voter fraud I witnessed. Dennis starts out the video by discussing Republican Governor Rick Snyder.  Although I am no fan of the Governor s I m not sure he ever knew about the decision by the GOP to ignore the voter fraud we witnessed. But Republican Secretary of State Ruth Johnson s office was fully aware of the voter fraud we witnessed and chose to look away.My best friend and business partner Leisa and I asked  to go to Detroit in 2012 to work as poll challengers. We were given the assignment, left early in the morning and headed into what we were sure was going to be a contentious day. We couldn t have been more wrong. The women who were supervising the polling places were serious and followed the rules to a tee. Besides the fact that every voter coming into the polling place had what is called a  Black Slate  (that s essentially a mock up of the ballot with the spots marked where voters were expected to fill in) we couldn t find a single irregularity or rule that wasn t being followed. The  Black Slate  was a sort of cheat sheet for uniformed voters. There were no decisions that had to be made by the voter, just fill in the ovals exactly as they appeared on the  Black Slate   and voil you ve voted! No need to pick candidates, judges or even to make decisions on ballot proposals, they ve already been made for you by whomever decided how black Michigan residents should vote. We were pleased to see that there weren t any issues at the Detroit polling place, so we decided to move to Pontiac where a friend had been messaging us about some  strange things  that were happening. She had never been a poll challenger before, but was wondering if people should have been putting their own ballots in the machine in the early morning hours just after the opening of the polls.Upon entering the polling place, we were greeting by a supervisor. She was a black woman with a very stern look on her face. We smiled, handed her a box of donuts, introduced ourselves and said we were working for the Republican Party as poll challengers. Her response was,  I ll be watching you watching me.  That was just the start of what turned out to be a very contentious day at the polls.I spent the day with my good friend Dennis Michael Lynch driving around Detroit and talking to people about jobs and other issues. While we were driving, Dennis asked me to tell him my story. Although it s not my most flattering angle LOL here is my story:There were 3 precincts within one building where we landed in Pontiac. The black female supervisor at the precinct where I was working was getting very frustrated by presence at the polls. It was pretty clear they were not conditioned to having anyone watch the voting process, as the workers and supervisors all appeared to be on edge. As voters came through they were asked to show identification in order to get their registration form. After they received their white voter registration form, they moved down the line for the next person who had a voter roll book with the names and addresses of the voters. The person with the book was supposed to check the picture ID against the name on the form and the name in the book. The person with the book appeared to be intentionally blocking me out so I couldn t see the book. I tried to lean around him and the supervisor yelled at me to  get back!  She kept saying,  You re making him uncomfortable!  I continued to move around until I could find a spot within the boundaries I was allowed to stand in, so I could be sure the voters names were matching those in the voter roll book. Every time I would start to get a closer look, he would slam the book shut and either say, their names were in the book, or that they weren t, in which case, he would pull out his flip phone and dial a number. He claimed he was calling the City Clerk and after giving the voters name, he would say the Clerk said  it was okay for them to vote . I would challenge the vote, as I couldn t see the book or the voters name on their ID, the supervisor would ignore me. Over and over again, I said I wanted to challenge the vote, and she ignored me. At one point things became so heated that she pressed her chest up against mine and was physically threatening me to back away from the process. I refused, and  the voters in the line began to cheer for her, like we were in some sort of cage match.After several SOS phone calls to the MI Republican Party hotline, they finally sent an attorney who witnessed the supervisor ignoring me when I asked for her to challenge the vote. Leisa, the attorney who was working for the GOP or Mitt Romney (we never got a straight answer about who he was working for from the GOP) and I took notes, we were all stunned at what we witnessed.I waited a few days after Mitt Romney s devastating defeat hoping I would hear from someone in the Republican Party. I never did. Several days later, I took it upon myself to call the MI GOP Party Chairman, who at the time was Bobby Schostak. I relayed part of my story to him, he didn t seem to be very interested and told me to call our Republican Secretary of State Ruth Johnson. I called her office and explained why I was calling. I never heard back. I called the person who scheduled us at the polling place and asked if the attorney was going to move forward with charges. He told us if the GOP was going to do anything, they would likely contact me. We never heard back from anyone.Two years later we returned to the same polling place and again witnessed more shenanigans. This time they were ready for us. Large men appeared out of nowhere and lined up against the wall directly across from where I was standing. They were watching me. On several occasions, one of them would come up and ask me why I was there. I explained I was only protecting the sanctity of the vote and it wasn t a Republican or Democrat thing. Protecting the sanctity of our vote was for the good of every American. He sneered and walked away. When things became heated between a poll worker and me because she kept insisting I was  making her uncomfortable,  I called and begged for the Republican Party to send a representative to help us out. When they finally sent someone, the City Clerk approached us and told me he had to leave. I explained that he could be there, so she called a Sheriff to come down and deal with me. Together, they threatened to have me arrested if I continued to break the rules. I explained I wasn t breaking any rules and reminded the Sheriff that if he was going to threaten me, he should understand the law. Ten minutes later, the City Clerk approached me and told me she was  sorry  that it appeared I hadn t broken any laws. As it turns out, she was only using the Sheriff as a prop. She wanted to create a news story. She wanted to say they had to call in a law enforcement officer to prevent me from intimidating the voters. When we left for lunch she called the press. The story was printed with no opposition to their lies and we were never contacted to give our side. The GOP party told us to leave after lunch. They said the press was there and they didn t want us to talk to them. We reluctantly left.After our second time at the same polls and not seeing any real improvement, I decided I needed to demand someone from the Secretary of State s office speak to me. I called Ruth Johnson s office and I was directed to her assistant, Linda Lee-Tarver (who for the record is a lovely woman and I do believe she was genuinely concerned about our situation). I spent over an hour on the phone with Linda Lee -Tarver explaining in great detail all that took place on that day. She said she was stunned, and that I should tell everything to Secretary of State Ruth Johnson s Chief of Staff Mike Seneyko. I then spoke with Mike on the phone for over an hour. He promised they would do something. I never heard back from him. To this day, I have yet to hear back from a single GOP official. Apparently, two mothers who risked their safety and possibly our lives to protect the sanctity of the vote was not important enough to them.Will we be poll challenger again? You betcha. Just knowing that we possibly slowed the bleed a bit makes me feel like it was all worth it. Do I trust the GOP to take voter fraud by Democrats seriously? Hell no ",THE DAY I WATCHED OUR VOTES BEING STOLEN…As The Republican Party I Risked My Life For Stood By And Did Nothing [VIDEO]
"Oct 19, 2017","NBC host Matt Lauer on Thursday asked former CIA Director John Brennan whether military officials surrounding President Donald Trump would  tackle him  before he engaged in a nuclear confrontation.Brennan replied that Trump has unilateral authority to authorize military action.Lauer asked Brennan hesitantly about reports surrounding America s procedure to deploy nuclear weapons under Trump, emphasizing the stories of  key players around the president  maybe locking Trump in a room or even tackling him to prevent the use of such weapons. I feel weird asking you this, but you ve read the same stories I ve read,  Lauer said to Brennan.  You know the key players around the president in [Jim] Mattis, [H.R.] McMaster, and John Kelly. Stories are going around out there that if the president inches closer to some kind of a nuclear confrontation with North Korea, that those guys are going to do something. They re going to lock him in a room. They re going to tackle him. Watch the incredible exchange here: You re smiling,  Lauer added.  But these are the stories that are out there. And they will prevent him from carrying out any action that would cause that. Is that all nonsense? No, I think the military leaders, current and former, Mattis, Kelly, also Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, they know the risks of escalation,  said Brennan, who served as CIA director during the Obama administration.  They know just how dangerous the situation is. I think they are governors on the president s instincts to continue to try to intimidate and bully. You re technically not answering the question. Would they take some action to prevent the president from carrying out an order?  Lauer asked. The president has unilateral authority to be able to authorize military action,  Brennan said.  That order goes through Secretary Mattis. Secretary Mattis can try to talk him out of it, disagree with it, carry it out, or not. After Brennan walked Lauer through the usual White House process of authorizing military actions, Lauer pushed his original question about tackling Trump, using a quote from Brennan. In July you said it is the obligation of some executive officials to refuse to carry out some of those orders that are inconsistent with what this country is all about,  Lauer quoted Brennan.Brennan clarified that he made that comment  in the context  of the firing of former FBI Director Jim Comey and the efforts to  delay and to put obstacles in some of the investigations that are underway. We are a country of laws,  Brennan added.  WFB ",WHAT?

Dirty Chicago politics used against Chicago s hometown girl by their master community organizer  The Obama State Department suddenly discovered and turned over 1,300 pages of emails from former Ambassador Chris Stevens.The emails were delivered just two days before Hillary s testimony before the Benghazi committee.None of the seven previous congressional investigations on Benghazi had access to Ambassador Stevens  emails. And they were just released after more than a year of requests.Via: Gateway PunditThe House Select Committee on Benghazi got a special delivery on Tuesday, two days before its high-profile hearing with former secretary of state Hillary Clinton   1,300 more pages of emails from the State Department.The Republican-led panel took to Twitter to vent about the seemingly late-in-the-game document dump of messages from Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya who died in the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the consulate, along with three other Americans.For months, the State Department has been releasing tens of thousands of pages of emails to the committee, but the GOP has consistently complained that the agency has dragged its feet in handing over all the relevant documents. State, for example, only a few weeks ago gave the committee about 900 Libya-related emails from Clinton, which the committee says it asked for at the start of its investigation well over a year ago.

Was Ms. Costello unaware or was she playing dumb? We ll probably never know but the press has been covering for the Obama administration on Benghazi since day one. The cover-up is real and it s happening from the press on up to the White House. The bottom line is that Mrs. Smith is correct and screaming it from the rooftops as any mom would for their child.

She has not called me. She has not contacted me. She has not given me any information,  she said,  except to tell me that I am not a member of the immediate family and I do not need to know.

At the time, Clinton said that it was their job  to figure out what happened and do everything [they could] to prevent it from happening again. Smith s response?  She s lying! She s absolutely lying!

"Oct 22, 2015","How long before US courts are asked to not bother trying cases where illegal aliens are involved, so as not to give the impression of being unfair When Francisco Javier Chavez posted bail on charges of beating a California toddler within an inch of her life in late July, there was little reason to expect the illegal immigrant, who has spent much of his adult life hopping back and forth across the Mexican border, would return to face justice.Two weeks later, at his scheduled arraignment on Aug. 13, Chavez was a no-show. The 27-year-old career criminal had put up $10,000, or 10 percent of the amount set for his alleged crimes by California s bail schedule. His disappearance is hardly a surprise to critics who believe violent illegal immigrants are, by definition, flight risks who should be denied bail in such serious cases. They say judges, especially in border states plagued by illegal immigrant crime, are naive or worse if they expect suspects who regularly cross in and out of Mexico to take the U.S. justice system seriously. Frankly, judges grant bail in cases like these because they are being foolish,  said Hans A. von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department lawyer now at The Heritage Foundation s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies.  The judge can consider bail for you when you are charged with a crime, but does not have to let you out on bail. If the state can show you are a flight risk, you should not get bail. If the state can show you are a danger to the public because of a history of violence, you should not get bail. Frankly, judges grant bail in cases like these because they are being foolish. While Chavez is in the wind, his alleged victim, the 2-year-old daughter of his live-in girlfriend, is now in foster care, paralyzed from the beating that also left her with both arms and a femur broken.Well before he was arrested in San Luis Obispo County for attacking the child, Chavez had compiled a lengthy criminal record that includes assault and drug convictions and arrests for violent acts such as kidnapping, car-jacking and cruelty to a child. He was deported in February 2014, but as in previous instances, found it easy to sneak back across the border and into the U.S. Francisco Javier Chavez, (l.), posted bail and has not been seen again after allegedly beating a toddler. Jose Enrique Vasquez, (r.), was accused of killing a child, but could be freed if he posts bail.Weeks after Chavez slipped out of custody, on Sept. 1, another 2-year-old toddler named Jonathan Montez was run down and killed in San Bernardino County. Illegal immigrant Jose Enrique Vasquez, 53, an unlicensed driver who witnesses said was speeding down the child s residential street, fled the scene, according to authorities. He was arrested two weeks later, and, like Chavez, was granted bail.Vasquez also has compiled a lengthy criminal record under various aliases, including charges of spousal abuse, battery of a peace officer, driving without a license, driving under the influence and armed robbery. But other charges in his criminal record might have given a judge pause in considering bail according to critics, including failure to appear in court, possession of false citizenship documents and eight deportations for illegally entering the country.The systems for granting bail in state courts varies from state to state. California s bail system lays out prescribed amounts for various crimes as a guideline for law enforcement and judges, but judges retain discretion to raise the amount in cases where the suspect is a flight risk or a danger to the public and the district attorney can add, drop or change the charges. Two states, Alabama and Missouri, have passed laws that preclude bail for illegal immigrants suspected of serious crimes, while judges in other states   notably Texas   weigh illegal status in making their decisions. But last year, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Arizona s 2006 law banning bail for illegal immigrant suspects violated their right to due process and amounted to punishment before trial. The 11-member panel s decision called the law a  scattered attempt  to deal with the problem of chronic bail-skipping by illegal immigrants. Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider the lower court s decision.Judges everywhere maintain discretion to deny bail to anyone they believe is likely to flee justice, yet they often fail to consider illegal status as a factor, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies. And critics say it should be obvious that someone here illegally and suspected of a violent crime will bolt rather than face justice, especially in border states such as California, where they can be out of the country an hour after posting bail. Aliens who commit acts of violence should not be released on bail, because they are clearly a danger to the public, and when we have someone with this kind of deportation history, clearly they are an obvious flight risk,  said von Spakovsky.  These judges are making mistakes granting bail to illegal aliens   reckless mistakes that endangered the public. The willingness of judges to grant bail to illegal immigrants charged with serious crimes compounds the ongoing controversy involving so-called sanctuary cities. Such jurisdictions, either by local statute or practice, refuse to inform federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents when an illegal immigrant is detained.But even jurisdictions that do not implement sanctuary policies believe that two federal court rulings, the 2013 California  Trust Act,  which limits  cruel and costly immigration hold requests in local jails,  and an ambiguous White House policy all bar them from holding illegal immigrants who have posted bail until federal authorities can collect and deport them   even if ICE asks them to via what is known as a  detainer request. The American Civil Liberties Union has sued jurisdictions that attempted to honor the ICE detainers, and the Department of Justice has not intervened in the cases to underscore its support of them. As a result, local law enforcement agencies say they have no choice but to let even violent illegal immigrant suspects walk once they are granted bail.

"Oct 23, 2016","How much more criminal activity are American voters willing to overlook? Have we, as Americans gotten to the point that no crime committed by Hillary or anyone attached to Hillary will disqualify her from being elected to the highest office in our nation? Are we willing to accept that we can no longer trust anyone working for a government organization in America? The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton s email use.Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI.The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.Mr. McAuliffe and other state party leaders recruited Dr. McCabe to run, according to party officials. She lost the election to incumbent Republican Dick Black.A spokesman for the governor said he  supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors  Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous. Among political candidates that year, Dr. McCabe was the third-largest recipient of funds from Common Good VA, the governor s PAC, according to campaign finance records. Dan Gecker received $781,500 from the PAC and $214,456 from the state party for a campaign that raised $2.9 million, according to records; and Jeremy McPike received $803,500 from the PAC and $535,162 from the state party, raising more $3.8 million that year for his candidacy.The governor could recall only one meeting with Mr. McCabe when he and other state Democrats met with the couple on March 7, 2015, to urge Dr. McCabe to run, according to the spokesman.The FBI said in a statement that during his wife s campaign Mr. McCabe  played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind. Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton s emails. FBI officials said that after that meeting with the governor in Richmond on March 7, Mr. McCabe sought ethics advice from the bureau and followed it, avoiding involvement with public corruption cases in Virginia, and avoiding any campaign activity or events.Mr. McCabe s supervision of the Clinton email case in 2016 wasn t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife s campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn t part of the email probe, officials said. Once I decided to run,  Dr. McCabe said,  my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be a supportive husband to me and our children. As a federal official everyone who participated in our campaign understood and respected that he could not participate. Mr. McCabe is a longtime FBI official who focused much of his career on terrorism. His wife is a hospital physician who campaigned in northern Virginia, where the couple live with their children.The 2015 Virginia State senate race was Dr. McCabe s first run for office and her campaign spent $1.8 million. The race was part of Mr. McAuliffe s failed effort to win a Democratic majority in the Virginia legislature, which would have given him significantly more sway in Richmond, the state capital.Mr. McAuliffe has been a central figure in the Clintons  political careers for decades. In the 1990s, he was Bill Clinton s chief fundraiser and he remains one of the couple s closest allies and public boosters. Mrs. Clinton appeared with him in northern Virginia in 2015 as he sought to increase the number of Democrats in the state legislature.

"Oct 24, 2015","Of course he s a  racist  for defending legal American citizens Unlike Obama, Trump s not looking to make friends with illegal aliens. Legal American citizens will reward his dedication to defending our borders with their votes Donald Trump, business mogul and current Republican front-runner, has reiterated his stand on the issue of illegal immigration, saying that he would deport up to 11 million illegals and then build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.Trump has taken plenty of heat from Democrats and his Republican challengers, some of whom tried to get him to back down from his non-politically correct views. The Donald will have none of it.In nearly every recent public appearance, and in the second Republican debates on Sept. 16, Trump noted that the number of illegals is likely much higher than 11 million, and that he would deport the lot of them forthwith.Specifically, Mr. Trump said he could facilitate the mass deportation and rid the U.S. of nearly all illegal immigrants within two years, and possibly as fast as 18 months. Saying  We have to get them out,  and  We are a nation of laws,  Trump employed his typically colorful language when he concluded that he would deport the illegals so quickly,  Your head will spin. Trump s 2-year plan would deport, on average, 15,068.4 illegal immigrants per day in order to reach the 11 million mark successfully.Until now, one of the starting points in most debates about illegal immigration, especially among moderate Republicans and Democrats, has been the notion that there are so many undocumented immigrants in the U.S., it would be impossible to deport them all.Trump proposes a fast deportation plan followed by the building of a massive border wall to keep future illegal crossers from coming over. Further, the candidate s proposal includes a provision whereby those who are deported can apply to re-enter the U.S., but they must follow the formal, legal procedures already in place.The formal entry process is lengthy, involves a significant amount of paperwork, and is intended to keep criminals and unsavory characters (like potential terrorists) out of the country. In fact, most developed nations have more stringent immigration policies than the U.S. does. Mexico, for example, is quite strict about its own southern border, where many Central American immigrants attempt to sneak into the country without proper documentation. Typically those illegal entrants are caught, jailed, and then quickly deported.Trump s views are not lost on African Americans, many of whom responded to a recent SurveyUSA poll about their preferences in the upcoming general election. One-fourth of the respondents said they would choose Trump over Hillary Clinton if that were the matchup in November 2016. In most national elections, blacks vote for the Democrat candidate about nine-to-one over the Republican. Many blacks see illegal immigration as one of the reasons for the exceedingly high unemployment rate in their communities.

"Oct 24, 2016","Those who were  shocked  by the latest ABC / Washington Post goal seeking report (aka  poll ) that shows Hillary opening up a 12-point lead with likely voters after the latest debate last Wednesday need to look a little further. Ironically, this  poll  farce was  embargoed for release after 9 a.m.  EST on Saturday, which made it a dominant topic of conversation on all the morning talk shows.Of course, like many of the recent polls from the likes of Reuters, ABC and The Washington Post, something curious emerges when you look just beneath the surface of the headline 12-point lead.Meanwhile, with huge variances in preference across demographics one can easily see how simple it is to  rig  a poll by over indexing to one group vs. another. While the pollsters release the the split of the sample pool by political affiliation, they do not share the split by any of the following demographics which are just as important to determining the outcome of the poll.  Zero Hedge METHODOLOGY   This ABC News poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Oct. 20-22, 2016, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 874 likely voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 36-27-31 percent, Democrats   Republicans   Independents. As we ve pointed out numerous times in the past, in response to Reuters  efforts to  tweak  their polls, per the The Pew Research Center, at least since 1992, democrats have never enjoyed a 9-point registration gap despite the folks at ABC and The Washington Post somehow convincing themselves it was a reasonable margin.Rush Limbaugh weighed in on the suspicious outlier poll that came out on Saturday night: I don t care what network you watch, maybe with Fox exempted, although certain places at Fox you ll find the same sentiment. It s over. And they all cite these polls. They all cite the polls that show Hillary up 10 to 12 points. And even take the low point at 10, I just saw somebody on CNN, a conservative Republican say,  At 10 points with two weeks it s over, there s no way you can reverse that, it s history. So they all believe the polls. In fact, their belief in the polls is biblical. I think these people have a greater confidence and faith in the polls than they do in the Bible. So it s over. And, furthermore, to show you just how over it is, the Democrats are actually now in red states where Trump may win those states, but they re in there and they re working down the ballot and they re gonna win back the House, they re gonna win back the Senate, and Chuck-U Schumer is gonna end up a majority leader in the Senate.And you Republicans, you are toast, do you understand? You Republicans, it s toast, and you Republicans had better start doing your postmortems right now, and you had better starting figuring out why this happened. You lost this because you saw to it that Trump was nominated, and if you weren t for Trump, you better find out who made it possible for Trump to be nominated, and you better do something about those people. Americans who are sick and tired of a corrupt media and the corrupt politicians they prop up, need to ignore these manufactured polls. Instead of wasting time reading this drivel, Americans need to be out knocking on doors and contacting friends, to explain to them why we need a President like Trump to DRAIN THE SWAMP!There has never been a better time to ignore Hillary s media and stay focused on the prize ",BUSTED!

A politician with a spine who respects our Constitution. You really can t ask for much more at this critical time in our nation RUSH: I think that there is a dark horse in this entire thing. I think there is one candidate who is positioned here. Now, I know it s getting late. Trump has had the lead for a hundred days here or more. Well, he s been in the lead ever since he got in. And there are now fewer days to Iowa than he has been in the lead. I mean, he s over the hump in that regard. But there s still a long way to go. It s politics. Any number of unforeseen, unpredictable events are potentially out there, and there has been somebody trucking along here, steady Eddie that has continued to be who he is and continues to lay down foundational markers for himself, and that s Ted Cruz. I think Ted Cruz is positioned, I wouldn t say ideally, I mean I m sure Cruz would love to be in the top two, top three here, but of all the others in the race, Trump and Carson here, and they re at number one and two, Carson s pulled ahead of Trump even in Iowa now, in two polls. But overall Trump leads and his lead continues to expand.But what if it doesn t? What if something happens? We re not shut out here. We still have somebody in our roster who opposes every bit of the Democrat agenda, perhaps more than anybody else in the race, and that s Cruz. I mean, Cruz does not have in his record any statement like Trump does of having supported certain things the Democrats have done. Cruz is inarguably thoroughbred conservative. The more I read about the Millennials, by the way, and I ve got some stuff about them in the Stack today, the more I read about Millennials and where they are attitudinally, politically, socially, economically, Cruz is somebody I think has a great opportunity to connect with them.In fact, before we get to the Trump sound bites, let me find this little thing on the Millennials.  Survey: Millennials Around the World Worry Most About Economic Inequality.  Now, this is typical of young people, young generations. They see injustice and unfairness and inequality out there and they want to right it, they want to correct it. When you have half of the country making   this is unbelievable   51% percent of the country making under $30,000 a year, that just cannot stand. We will not have a standard economy with that kind of reality. We just won t.The website here is USA Today, and the survey comes from the World Economic Forum, and they released it yesterday.  Millennials around the world worry most about social and economic equality, remain skeptical of government and the media, and count Tesla CEO Elon Musk as one their heroes, according to a World Economic Forum survey released Sunday. More than 1,000 young people, ages 20 to 30, from 125 countries and who are all active in the forum s Global Shapers Community. It s a left wing bunch, the World Economic Forum, it s an establishment left-wing bunch, understand, but they still went out and they talked to these Millennials all over the world, 125 different countries.  The average age was 28. The results were released at the beginning of a three-day World Economic Forum conference in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates.  It s right down the road from Dubai.  The survey showed that 65% of the Millennials said one of their top three goals in selecting a job was to make a difference in society, their city or country.  Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, of course they want that. They want to right wrongs. They want to correct social injustice wherever they see it. And when Ted Cruz gets going, that s ultimately what he s all about.He s all about everybody being the best they can be using their natural   he s conservative top to bottom, through and through, no matter how you slice it, left, right, up, down.  They also look for an opportunity to learn, followed by career advancement. More than nine out of 10 said they would be willing to relocate to advance their career.  That is the number one obstacle most people put in their own way. They re unwillingness to move. I ve always said that most of the obstacles people face in life are self-imposed, and the number one obstacle is the unwillingness to move. If you live in a place, let s say you want to be a brain surgeon and you live in a place where there s not a hospital, you re gonna have to move.If you want to get big in media and you live in Peoria, you re gonna have to move. And a lot of people don t want to move. The comfort level of being at home, friends, family, all that, it s a big obstacle. People get past that and nine out of 10 of these Millennials say they would be willing to relocate in order to advance their career, that s a big deal. Anyway, it s just a long way to go here and the Republican establishment has made it clear they are not interested in a conservative nominee. The Republican establishment has made it clear that the role of conservatives in this primary is to once again split the vote and split money.It was the money, don t forget, it was the money that was gonna save Jeb, or, if not Jeb, the next chosen establishment candidate. And the money, the ads, are not working. The ads simply are not overcoming, and they always have, the opposition to some of these candidates.

That is, except for most independent filmmakers like Mr. Hannity, who agreed to become an executive producer and fund most of the $3 million budget for  Let There Be Light,  a faith-based drama opening in theaters Thursday that stars Kevin Sorbo, known for  Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. He s the best executive producer anybody could ever ask for,  Mr. Sorbo said of Mr. Hannity.  He said,  Here s the money. Go make the movie and show me when you re done.In the film, which Mr. Sorbo also directed, he plays Dr. Sol Harkens, a famous book-writing atheist who, while living for the crowd s roars of approval while skewering Christians in packed debates, also struggles with loneliness, the death of his young son and the leery attitudes of his two remaining sons, who are being raised by his Christian ex-wife, Katy, who is portrayed by Mr. Sorbo s own wife, Sam Sorbo.The executive producer of the  Let Their Be Light  movie, Sean Hannity tweeted about the Sorbo s movie: Let There Be Light  opens THIS FRIDAY! Locations listed at https://t.co/9hkyEX1UVi https://t.co/NxlxjswYJG  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 26, 2017President Trump retweeted Sean Hannity s tweet about the  Let Their Be Light  movie, and said that Hannity s movie will be  another Sean success! Will be another Sean success! https://t.co/SlNTENvJLA  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2017The couple s two sons also feature in  Let There Be Light. Sean Hannity interviewed the very talented Sorbo family recently, and asked them what it was like for their family to work together to make the movie:After Miss Sorbo first came up with the idea for the film, she approached veteran screenwriter Dan Gordon ( The Hurricane,   Wyatt Earp ), who agreed to co-write the script with her. A random contact from Mr. Hannity led to his immediately bankrolling the film. Sean Hannity, kind of out of the blue, called my husband and said,  I want to do a faith-based movie, and I want to work with you,  Miss Sorbo recalled.Not long after, Mr. Hannity, who juggles two full-time jobs in radio and TV, found himself in a pitch meeting in New York with the Sorbos and Mr. Gordon. Twenty minutes later, he cut them a check.Here s a sneak peek at the movie  Let There Be Light : It s better than I ever dreamed it could be in terms of the quality, the acting and the cinematic value,  Mr. Hannity said.  I think with all that s happening out in Hollywood, there might be an opportunity here to make more of these independent films that people will go see, and that s why I wanted to lend my name to it.

"Oct 27, 2015","Does this mean Republicans in the House are FINALLY going to start standing up for the Americans who elected them to be their representatives in Washington DC? Does this action represent the change we re all desperate to see now that Boehner is vacating his seat? House Republicans on Tuesday introduced a resolution to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, accusing him of making  false statements  under oath and failing to comply with a subpoena for evidence.In case you ve forgotten, here are two of the most powerful testimonies exposing the tyranny of our government  we have ever posted on our website:Our friend Becky Gerritson (who is currently running for a seat in our US Congress):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4_MT8MkIAAnd then there was the powerful testimony by Founder and Chairman of True the Vote, Catherine Engelbrecht:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db21AQu30XwHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and 18 other committee members introduced the resolution to begin impeachment proceedings. In doing so, they followed through on a threat first made over the summer, when Republicans accused the IRS leader of making inaccurate statements to Congress regarding the Tea Party targeting scandal and its aftermath. Commissioner Koskinen violated the public trust,  Chaffetz said in a statement Tuesday.  He failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress. The IRS issued a statement later Thursday saying,  The IRS vigorously disputes the allegations in the resolution. We have fully cooperated with all of the investigations. The announcement of the impeachment resolution comes on the same day Koskinen testified before the Senate Finance Committee, and after the Justice Department on Friday decided to close its investigation of the targeting scandal without pursuing criminal charges.

In the video below, Watson does a brilliant job of exposing the hypocrisy of the media and why they are not to be believed or trusted when it comes to offering actual news without a nauseating leftist bias.From Ned Ryan of Fox News  You may have heard of the scandal brewing in Washington. Presidential advisers cutting sweetheart deals with a foreign power, signing million dollar lobbying contracts with that foreign power, bribes being proffered, and the foreign government gained unprecedented access to government agencies and crucial U.S. natural resources? And what if I told you that foreign power was Russia?Collusion you say? Perhaps. Collusion with Trump? Nope.I m talking about a news story that fittingly is coming back from the dead just before Halloween to scare a lot of Democrats, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Obama administration officials. If you want to take a deeper dive on this issue, read the book  Clinton Cash,  by Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute. But here are the basics.A decade ago, a long-time Clinton Foundation donor, Frank Giustra, sold his uranium company to another firm, Uranium One. With that deal, Uranium One now owned uranium mines in the western U.S., including Wyoming, with about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity, and about ten percent of the actual uranium mined in the U.S.In 2009, Rosatom, Russia s nuclear agency, took a 17-percent position in Uranium One. A year later, in the summer of 2010, Rosatom bought majority control of the Uranium One, effectively giving the Russian government-controlled entity proprietary access to one-fifth of the U.S. uranium supply.And then there s that whole phony Trump-Russian dossier story Watch, as Paul Joseph Watson DESTROYS the liberal media for force-feeding their viewers with  24/7 phony Trump-Russian coverage, without having so much as ONE actual identifiable or legitimate source to back up their assertions. But when ACTUAL evidence is put forth about REAL collusion with the Russians by Hillary Clinton and the DNC for the purposes of affecting the outcome of the election,  the media goes silent.Enjoy:",HILARIOUS!

She s just been better than anyone America s ever seen at not getting caught On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is  rigged. Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,  said Sen. Clinton.  And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. Chomsky recalls being taken aback that  anyone could support the idea offered by a national political leader, no less that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.

"Oct 3, 2015","This certainly isn t who the GOP power-brokers want to see in the top two Donald Trump has boasted that he s  leading every poll and in most cases big.  Not anymore. The latest IBD/TIPP Poll shows him in second place, seven points behind Ben Carson.The nationwide survey found that 24% of Republicans back Carson, compared with 17% who say they support Trump.Marco Rubio came in third with 11% and Carly Fiorina fourth at 9%. Jeb Bush, once considered a prohibitive favorite, ranked fifth with just 8% support, which was a point lower than those who say they are still undecided.The IBD/TIPP Poll has a proven track record for accuracy, based on its performance in the past three presidential elections. In a comparison of the final results of various pollsters for the 2004 and 2008 elections, IBD/TIPP was the most accurate. And the New York Times concluded that IBD/TIPP was the most accurate among 23 polls over the three weeks leading up to the 2012 election.The October poll, conducted from Sept. 26 to Oct. 1, included 377 registered voters who are Republican or registered independents who lean toward the Republican Party, with a margin of error of +/- 5 percentage points.Peak Trump? Other polls show Trump s support slipping in recent weeks. The Real Clear Politics average of six national polls shows him falling from 30.5% in mid-September to 23.3% by the end of the month. That average does not include the IBD/TIPP findings.  Things appear to be catching up with Trump on multiple fronts,  said Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, which conducts IBD s monthly poll.  In addition to facing increasing attacks from other candidates, Trump s boycott of Fox News may have set him back,  Mayur said, noting that the poll was being conducted during Trump s self-imposed hiatus.When asked on CNBC about his slipping poll numbers, Trump said that  if I fell behind badly, I would certainly get out. Carson s gain comes after his controversial remarks on  Meet the Press  that he couldn t support a Muslim for president. See story here. Rubio s third-place standing shows he has gained considerable ground since the second GOP debate.

She said efforts to locate him were unsuccessful.Sharif faces 11 charges, including five of attempted murder in the Saturday night attack in Edmonton, Alberta. Police have raised the possibility of filing terrorism charges against Sharif because there was an Islamic State flag in his car and he was investigated in 2015 for espousing extremist views.Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Sharif, 30, entered Canada legally in 2012 and obtained refugee status.A preliminary hearing for Sharif opened Tuesday but was recessed so he can find a lawyer. He appeared on closed-circuit television and followed proceedings with the help of an interpreter.

After the terror attack today on the streets of New York City by a radical Muslim who was allegedly here on a  diversity visa , Imam Tawidi took off the gloves on Twitter and told the world that he warned Mayor DeBlasio, but was  Ignored! Tawhidi regularly tweets about the evils of extreme Islam:Extremists cannot force us into their paradise. In fact, I don t want to be in paradise if they re going to be there as well.  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017The Australian Imam is young, well presented and articulate. He is charming, has successfully utilized social media and has a strong following amongst the Australian public. Perhaps most importantly to a government that yearns for unity amongst its electorate, Tawhidi is an immigrant who champions the integration of fellow expats into the Australian community. The complete package, as it were.He isn t shy about calling out Islamic extremists and the people who suffer under Islamic extremist rule. Yesterday, Imam Tawhidi tweeted about his friend who was beaten to death by the Basij Militia of Iran over his anti-terrorist views:My friend Ali Yazdanshenas has passed away yesterday after being beaten to death by the Basij militia of Iran for his anti-terrorist views. pic.twitter.com/E04FJFcPyX  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 30, 2017However, there is a barrier preventing Australian elites from supporting this maverick cleric, and that is that he does not follow the liberal narrative. Instead of simply condemning obscene teachings associated with his religion, Tawhidi demands modification. Rather than apologize for shortcomings within the immigrant community, the Imam has called for immediate action, encouraging a ban on Islamic schools and Islamist organizations like Hizb ut Tahrir. Through this, Tawhidi has even received the endorsement of none other than Ayaan Hirsi Ali   perhaps the most famous anti-Islamist (and Islamic) activist in the world   who has suggested that Tawhidi should be  elevated  to sit amongst and give counsel to politicians and leaders.Tawhidi is, therefore, one of those rare public figures: a reformer who not only denounces elements of Islam but actually seeks to restructure its teachings and interpretations. However, in the current global environment, the courage to promote such ideas inevitably leads to danger; the threat of violence is so present that Tawhidi has been forced to implement constant security measures in both his professional and private life.  The Spectator One might believe that a courageous person like Imam Tawhidi would be a valuable ally to America in their efforts to defeat radical Islam in the United States.  Based on the Imam s tweets, following the terror attack by a  diversity visa  holder in NYC, it appears that Mayor DeBlasio didn t find his warnings to be useful.Imam Tawhidi claims he personally sent letters to Mayor DeBlasio, and that he  did nothing. About #NYC terrorist attack, I personally sent letters to Mayor De Blasio online & in person about terrorist breeding in NYC.He did nothing.

On a sunny day in the Iraqi city of Karbala, Tawhidi was standing outside a mosque when, within earshot, a bomb exploded. As crowds ran from the scene and emergency crews rushed to help the survivors, the speakers of the mosque announced to the street below that Islamic State forces had invaded Mosul. If ever there was a time to speak out against Islamist terrorism, it was then.However, Tawhidi s campaigning has attracted many critics within the Islamic community itself. Calling for the closure of Islamic schools is bound to court controversy, but it is his contention that Islamic teachings are the causal link to Islamist terrorist acts that seems to really rile community leaders. Following the Manchester bombing, Tawhidi appeared in a fiery TV exchange with Dr. Jamal Rifi, imploring his fellow guest to acknowledge that the Islamic holy scripture  teach(es) the beheading of people .Perhaps Tawhidi is just the kind of person America, and the know-it-all liberals in European nations, who are being overrun by Islamic extremists posing as immigrants, need to be listening to, and perhaps next time, they might want to consider taking his warnings seriously ",WOW!

Sheppard Jr) to a surviving student of the shooting.Summary: The immediate on-line web history of Chris Harper-Mercer showed him to be a mixed-race, angry young man in general alignment with various radical racially aligned groups such as Black Lives Matter, Fuck The Police and Fuck Yo Flag   all of which carry a sentiment of favorability and ideological alignment with Islam which was similarly evident in the Ferguson protest movement.[ Against this backdrop shooting  White   Christians  makes sense. ]However, in the course of several hours (one media cycle)   the media narrative is selling a profile of a loner, mentally disturbed individual without any mention of his previous writings (deleted/changed), behaviors (hidden) and social tendencies (ignored).Why?Perhaps the answer lies within the response to the shooting from the White House where President Obama took quickly to the microphones to decry another school shooting without fully understanding the motive and intent.Watch Obama s speech following the Oregon mass shooting. His motive and intent in this video are pretty clear.

"Oct 5, 2015","Mums the word on Christian persecution in the White House.  Just let them get a whiff of possible injustice against a Muslim in America and Obama s radicalized DOJ is on it, like a dog on a bone In its latest effort to protect Muslim rights in the United States the Obama Justice Department is suing an Illinois town for denying a rezoning application to convert an office building into an Islamic temple. Failing to approve plans for the Islamic worship center violates a 2000 law known as the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), according to a Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuit filed this week in federal court. The accused are lawmakers in Des Plaines, a Chicago suburb with a population of about 60,000. In 2013 the Des Plaines City Council voted 5-3 to reject a rezoning request made by the American Islamic Center (AIC) to make a vacant office building in a manufacturing zone to an institutional zone that would allow a worship center.The plan called for 3,661 square feet of worship space that would be used for prayer services on Fridays and Sundays as well as nightly prayers during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan when Muslims fast and commemorate the first revelation of the Quran to Muhammad. The new temple would also be used for youth group events and other gatherings, according the rezoning application.In nixing the plan, Des Plaines aldermen expressed concern about the loss of tax revenue since religious institutions are nonprofits that don t pay taxes. They also cited traffic and safety issues for voting against the project.In its lawsuit the DOJ dismisses those issues and claims that the city s  treatment and denial of AICs rezoning requests constitutes the imposition or implementation of a land use regulation that imposes a substantial burden on AICs religious exercise.  Denying a city zoning change to accommodate a Muslim temple also discriminates against the Islamic group on the basis of religion, according to the feds. Attorney General Loretta Lynch wants the court to issue an order forcing Des Plaines to let AIC construct its worship center in the city. The ability to establish a place for collective worship is a fundamental protection of the First Amendment and our civil rights laws,  said Vanita Gupta, head of the DOJ s bloated civil rights division, in a statement announcing the lawsuit.  The Justice Department will remain vigilant in its mission to ensure that all religious groups enjoy the right to practice their faiths freely.  The federal prosecutor handling the case in Illinois said  the freedom to practice the religion of one s choosing is a precious right in our country  and the DOJ will continue to  enforce the laws that protect this important right. The DOJ s enthusiasm for protecting Muslim rights is in a class of its own, however. Back in 2010 Obama s first Attorney General, Eric Holder, personally reassured Muslims of DOJ protection during an address at a San Francisco-based organization (Muslim Advocates) that urges members not to cooperate in federal terrorism investigations. It was a first for the nation s top federal prosecutor to publicly condone illegal behavior. A few years later the DOJ warned against using social media to spread information considered inflammatory against Muslims and threatened that it could constitute a violation of civil rights.One of the biggest and most unbelievable moves by the DOJ came in 2012 when it issued a broad order changing the way the U.S. government trains federal agents to combat terrorism and violent extremism by eliminating all materials that shed a negative light on Muslims. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) actually destroyed instructional material that characterized Muslims as prone to violence or terrorism and hundreds of pages from the 9/11 attacks were purged because they were considered offensive to Muslims under the new initiative.In 2013 Judicial Watch published an in-depth report documenting and analyzing Islamist active measures and influence operations targeting anti-terrorism training in the U.S.Via: Family Security Matters",UNBELIEVABLE: IL City Denies Re-zoning Request For Islamic Worship Center…That’s When Obama’s Radical DOJ Stepped In

I know Hollywood and NY liberal actors live an insulated life, safe from the security or financial concerns everyday Americans face, but seriously? Does she not have a TV? Does she not have access to Youtube or the internet?How is it possible that she s missed the vicious attacks launched at Trump supporters by Black Lives Matter terrorists, anarchists and leftists of every size, shape and color against innocent Trump supporters?Just the other day, we reported about a young man who attended a Black Lives Matter rally in CA and was beaten by a mob of around 300 people for simply wearing a Trump hat. Did she somehow miss the rioting and attacks on senior citizens, or the woman who was trapped by mobs of anti-Trump attackers who proceeded to throw eggs and various items at her head and body?Donald Trump might have made two guest appearances in HBO s iconic comedy Sex and the City, but the show s star, Sarah Jessica Parker, has speculated his political ascendancy is putting her life in danger.Throwback to when Trump was on Sex and the City. pic.twitter.com/d72FFLvx8w  Billo Rani (@prabhjotkp) September 27, 2016Parker, a high-profile Hollywood liberal who has hosted fundraisers for President Obama, says the political climate generated by Donald Trump has left her fearing she, actor husband Matthew Broderick, and their friends will end up getting hit or worse.SJP, whose new HBO show Divorce begins this Sunday, told Time Out New York:  The thing I keep saying is that even if   please, God   Trump is not elected, I m afraid there is now a climate that has said in silence that it is okay to hurt anybody you not-so-secretly disagree with.   Whether it s how they look or the lifestyle you think they re leading or the color of their skin, or they ve come here to, you know, take advantage of this country. I m terrified.

They re just going to reach out and smack us or beat the shit of us or, I don t know, shoot us, shoot my friends. I m not being dramatic when I think of this. I m shocked. SJP is so shocked that she winds up issuing a rallying cry for Trump:  I will fight to the very end for you to go and vote for Mr. Trump. Go do it. But you don t have to hurt me to do it.

After turning her back and pausing, Cruz does swear to defend the Constitution, and then enthusiastically repeats to uphold the Puerto Rican Constitution.Her approval rating was as low as 24% earlier this year.

"Oct 6, 2016","FBI files reveal missing email  boxes  in Clinton case, allegations of evidence tamperingBuried in the 189 pages of heavily redacted FBI witness interviews from the Hillary Clinton email investigation are details of yet another mystery   about two missing  bankers boxes  filled with the former secretary of state s emails.The interviews released earlier this month, known as 302s, also reveal the serious allegation that senior State Department official Patrick Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change the classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public.The details about the boxes are contained in five pages of the FBI file   with a staggering 111 redactions   that summarize the statements of a State Department witness who worked in the  Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS).  The employee told the FBI that,  Initially, IPS officials were told there were 14 bankers boxes of former Secretary of State Hillary CLINTON s emails at CLINTON s Friendship Heights office.  Friendship Heights is a neighborhood that straddles the Northwest neighborhood of the District of Columbia and Maryland.The State Department witness further explained to the FBI that  on or about December 5, 2014, IPS personnel picked up only 12 bankers boxes of CLINTON s emails from Williams & Connolly. The officials were not sure if the boxes  were consolidated or what could have happened to the two other boxes.  Clinton s chief lawyer at Williams & Connolly, who leads all Clinton-related legal matters, is David Kendall. He has successfully represented Bill and Hillary Clinton together and separately throughout decades of their legal entanglements since the 1980 s, ranging from the former president s sex scandals to missing billing records for Hillary Clinton s work as a partner in The Rose Law Firm on behalf of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and Capital Management Services.In the documents provided by Kendall s law firm, the witness told the FBI they were  unable to locate any of her emails from January-April 2009.  This timeframe is crucial as it covers the start of Clinton s term as secretary of state and when she set up a private server for all government business, in turn skirting public records laws.Read more: FOX News",MISSING: TWO FILE ‘BOXES’ OF CLINTON E-MAILS…Evidence Tampering?

"Oct 7, 2015","THE H-1B VISA PROGRAM IS KILLING JOBS FOR NATIVE AMERICANS! It was just reported in the recent jobs numbers that native-born Americans are losing jobs while immigrant employment is up. Corporations like Disney are bringing in foreign workers with the H-1B visa and having the American employees train the foreign worker for their job. Talk about adding insult to injury! This needs to stop but Washington lobbyists and the Chamber of Commerce really can t help themselves they love that cheap labor. The discrimination against Americans is very real and it s about time the workers fought back!Some U.S. IT workers who have been replaced with H-1B contractors are alleging discrimination and are going to court. They are doing so in increasing numbers.There are at least seven IT workers at Disney who are pursuing, or plan to pursue, federal and state discrimination administrative complaints over their layoffs. Another Disney worker, still employed by the firm, has filed a state administrative discrimination complaint in California. These complaints are a first step to litigation.Separately, there are ongoing court cases alleging discrimination against two of the largest India-based IT services firms, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services. The federal judges in each of cases have given a green light for the plaintiffs to proceed after rejecting dismissal efforts.There may be federal interest in examining this issue. The U.S. Department of Justice s Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices was asked by 10 U.S. senators in April to examine the IT layoffs at Southern California Edison (SCE) and to determine whether SCE or its contractors were  engaged in prohibited citizenship status discrimination. What s being challenged, in sum, is the job replacement system created by the H-1B program. U.S. IT workers, as a condition for their severance, are being made to train H-1B visa-holding contractor replacements to take over their jobs.The contractors often work for IT services firms that employ large numbers of H-1B workers. Most of these workers are from India and regional countries. This practice of replacing U.S. workers with foreign workers constitutes national origin discrimination, say its critics.The court case against Tata, whose plaintiffs include a former SCE employee, alleges that some 95% of its employees are South Asian or mostly Indian. Tata has called the allegations baseless.The Disney IT workers  were terminated because they were American citizens and all their replacements were foreign-born Indians,  said Sara Blackwell, a Florida attorney, who is representing seven of the Disney workers at its parks and resort division. She has set up an organizationto challenge the practice. Other discrimination claims, including age and disability, will be made as well. Those complaints are being filed with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, which sees if a settlement is possible prior to any lawsuit.Disney did not respond immediately for comment. We need to protect American workers,  said James Otto, a California attorney who is representing a Disney ABC Television Group employee in that state. This complaint is being filed in California under the state s Fair Employment and Housing Act, which Otto said is similar to the federal process, but with more protections.Otto s client still works at Disney and had been targeted for an earlier layoff, but Disney rescinded those layoffs. Nonetheless, the complaints being made include a hostile workforce and national origin discrimination.Read more: Computer World",American Workers Finally Fighting Back Against Corporations Replacing Them With Cheaper Foreign Labor

One such recipient is none other than the Open Society Foundation, chaired by billionaire George Soros.2ndVote has found the NFLPA provides financial support to Soros  Center for Community Change Action, the social justice arm of the organization, which, according to the Washington Free Beacon,  has been involved in direct action against President Donald Trump and Republicans before and after the November elections. The NFLPA has been donating to several far-left and anti-trump causes dating back to at least 2013.Soros has a long history of funding some of the most radical and far-left causes in the United States.He is known to have supported the Occupy Wall Street protests of 2012, the National Resource Defense Council, an Anti-Trump environmental organization, pro-abortion movements including Planned Parenthood, as well as numerous anti-Trump  resistance  causes.Soros has also funded at least 56 of the  Key Partners  from the Women s March on Washington, which occurred the day after Trump s inauguration.Despite being touted by the media as  a huge, spontaneous groundswell  and a  grassroots, independent uprising  of women, it turns out to be just another well funded and organized operation by the Soros empire.A RECENT REPORT ON SOROS FUNDING OF LEFTIST CAUSES:WOW!

Soros actually has a group whose stated goal is to take money from rich Jews and give it to those with less. Considering a video just surfaced yesterday showing George Soros (a Jew) admitting that he helped confiscate property from Jews during WWII, the idea that Soros is funding such a group is not really so stunning.They re all here. 187 groups being used to destroy America, thanks to funding by billionaire George Soros. Here are the groups who are using Trump s election as an excuse to take down America:There have been many articles written about George Soros and his collectivist activism. Soros is a business magnate, investor, philanthropist, and author who is of Jewish-Hungarian ancestry and holds dual citizenship. He is chairman of Soros Fund Management. Discover the Networks has published a comprehensive list of organizations funded by Soros and his Open Society Institute.Some of these groups have actively opposed Donald Trump for president and may be part of the recent levels of violence and chaos seen at his rallies. Many of the groups favor: open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice.Organizations that, in recent years, have received direct funding and assistance from George Soros and his Open Society Institute (OSI) include the following.

Nine Brookings economists signed a petition opposing President Bush s tax cuts in 2003.Campaign for America s Future: This group supports tax hikes, socialized medicine, and a dramatic expansion of social welfare programs.Campaign for Better Health Care: This organization favors a single-payer, government-run, universal health care system. Campaign for Youth Justice: This organization contends that  transferring juveniles to the adult criminal-justice system leads to higher rates of recidivism, puts incarcerated and detained youth at unnecessary risk, has little deterrence value, and does not increase public safety. Campus Progress: A project of the Soros-bankrolled Center for American Progress, this group seeks to  strengthen progressive voices on college and university campuses, counter the growing influence of right-wing groups on campus, and empower new generations of progressive leaders. Casa de Maryland: This organization aggressively lobbies legislators to vote in favor of policies that promote expanded rights, including amnesty, for illegal aliens currently residing in the United States.Catalist: This is a for-profit political consultancy that seeks  to help progressive organizations realize measurable increases in civic participation and electoral success by building and operating a robust national voter database of every voting-age American.

"Oct 8, 2015","Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has dropped out of the race for House Speaker. The reason he gave to the Republican Caucus for dropping out:  I am not the right person to lead at this moment.  McCarthy was expected to win the Speakership in a landslide but his comments on Benghazi were frowned upon by his fellow Republicans. McCarthy s mistake of saying the Benghazi investigation was all about politics was exactly what Hillary Clinton needed to revive her campaign. Ultimately, he was concerned he could not get the 218 votes needed to win: McCarthy s decision, announced moments before Republicans were set to nominate their candidate, will postpone the vote for speaker. McCarthy had been running against Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Daniel Webster, R-Fla., before he dropped out, and it s unclear whether other candidates will now step forward.While McCarthy, R-Calif., faced vocal opposition from some conservative members and groups, he was thought to have more than enough support to win the party s nomination in the vote initially set for Thursday. Fox News is told McCarthy, in revealing his choice, simply told colleagues it was not his time.His withdrawal rattled fellow lawmakers, particularly allies in leadership. But addressing reporters afterward, McCarthy said he thinks the party needs a  fresh face.

"Oct 8, 2016","For decades Hillary Clinton has claimed that back in the 1970s the U.S. Marines rejected her because she was a woman. But a look at some of the information released by Wikileaks reveals that the Democrat nominee has more recently changed her story and admitted that the Marines did not reject her because of her gender.One of the earliest reports on Hillary s rejection claim came from The New York Times  Maureen Dowd, who in 1994 reported Clinton s claims as delivered at an event meant to honor military women hosted at the Capital in Washington D.C.Dowd reported that Hillary told those gathered that she was rejected by the Marines because she was a woman. Dowd wrote that in 1975, the year she married Bill Clinton and when she was teaching at the University of Arkansas law school in Fayetteville, Hillary said she went to the Marines to see if she could sign up.She was 27 then, she said, and the Marine recruiter was about 21. She was interested in joining either the active forces or the reserves, she recalled, but was swiftly rebuffed by the recruiter, who took a dim view of her age and her thick glasses.  Not Very Encouraging. You re too old, you can t see and you re a woman,  Mrs. Clinton said she was told, adding that the recruiter dismissed her by suggesting she try the Army.  Maybe the dogs would take you,  she recalled the recruiter saying. It was not a very encouraging conversation,  she said.  I decided maybe I ll look for another way to serve my country. Flash forward to one of her speeches in 2013 that Wikileaks just published. somehow, the lie she told so many years ago had morphed into the fact that the Marines wouldn t take her because they felt she was too old:This according to the excerpt from her 2013 appearance:Question from the audience: Is it true that until 1975 you applied for the Marines and they told you no because you were a female?Hillary: No. Here is what did happen: It was actually   there was a recruiting station, and I thought, you know, maybe I should consider serving my country by joining the military. So I walked into the recruiting station, and the person on duty was a Marine. And I think I was 26, maybe 27, so, an older potential recruit. I said to the young Marine, I said,  Well, you know, I d be interested in getting some information to see whether I could maybe serve. I m a lawyer. Maybe I could help in some way.  He says,  Well, I think you are too old for the Marines but maybe the dogs will take you.  I said,  The dogs?  He goes,  Yeah, you know, the Army.

"Oct 9, 2015","When you re a Republican and get a ringing endorsement from radical pro-amnesty carnival barker, Luis Guti rrez  you should probably re-think your party affiliation Friday on MSNBC, Rep. Luis Guti rrez (D-IL) said Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI)doesn t want to be House Speaker because he would have to work with the  extreme  Republicans who want to take away the rights of gays, woman and minorities.Guti rrez said,  Look, they cannibalize their own. First Cantor, then McCarthy, before that Boehner. That s why Paul Ryan doesn t want to be the Speaker of the House. He doesn t want to be the Speaker of the House because he understands that there are 35, 40 Republican members of the House that didn t come here to govern. They came here to destroy government. They came here to take the government down. They don t want to coalesce and work with the other side of the aisle. They want to take the country backwards. He continued,  Yesterday I was at a hearing, the judiciary committee. What do they want to do now they have a new committee and a new investigation into Planned Parenthood. Why? Because they want to turn the clock back on women. They want women to go back to the  50s and that  Mad Men  series that we watch on cable TV where women didn t have rights. That s what they want to do, and that s why he doesn t want to take on the Speakership. They want to turn the clock back, and they have chaos. Look, if they can t do something as fundamental as pick a new leader, as fundamental as pick a new leader, and every time they pick a leader, they cannibalize that leader. How are they going to lead this nation? Complementing Ryan he continued,  Let me just say this. smartest person, I believe, in the GOP conference and would be good for the country, would be good for the Republican Party, would be good for the House of Representatives   because Paul Ryan is the kind of individual that will work with other people on the other side of the aisle, and I think that that s what need. He added,  He would work with Democrats in order to solve the problems of America and that s exactly what the 35, 40 members, these extreme members, very vocal, organized, extreme members of the Republican caucus don t want. They don t want an American solution. They think, you know what, gay people should go back in the closet, women should be at home in the kitchen, and those Latinos and Asians, why don t we just make them invisible again or deport them altogether? That s their philosophy of government. They want to go back before there was a Voting Rights and a Civil Rights Act in America. When I was born in America in 1953, it was separate but equal. But let me assure you, it was separate but not real equal for people like me. That s the America they want to take us back to. and guess what? the vast majority of the American people are going to push back strong against that attempt to take us backwards.

"Oct 9, 2016","Wow! If I were Hillary, I d stop sending people to her website during the debates as a way to deflect from actual issues. They may find out something pretty horrifying like maybe a TRILLION dollar tax hike! Trillion dollar tax hike   Hillary s tax hike proposals will raise taxes on the American people by over $1,000,000,000,000 over the next ten years, based on her campaign s own numbers.Payroll Tax Hike   Hillary said she would not veto a payroll tax increase on all Americans should such a bill reach her desk. She said she would set her middle class tax pledge aside. This took place Jan. 12 in Iowa, and it s on video:Moderator:  Democrats have introduced a plan that Senator Sanders supports that you ve come out against because it is funded by a payroll tax. If that were to reach your desk as President, would you veto it in order to make good on your tax pledge? Hillary Clinton:  No. No. Soda Tax Hike   Hillary endorsed a steep new soda pop tax in Philadelphia. This will cost soda purchasers an extra $2.16 per 12-pack. Bernie Sanders called out Hillary s violation of her middle class tax pledge: Frankly, I am very surprised that Secretary Clinton would support this regressive tax after pledging not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. This proposal clearly violates her pledge,  he said.Sanders also said:  The mechanism here is fairly regressive. And that is, it will be increasing taxes on low-income and working people. 25% National Gun Tax   Hillary endorsed a new national 25% retail sales tax on guns.  I am all for that,  she told the Senate in 1993. On June 5, 2016 she was asked about her gun tax endorsement by George Stephanopoulos on ABC s This Week. She acknowledged her gun tax endorsement and did not disavow it, saying she wanted the gun tax money to pay for Hillarycare. If you have any doubts about her strong desire to impose a new gun tax, watch her face in the video.Doubling of federal excise tax on guns   Hillary also endorsed a doubling of the existing federal excise tax on guns.65% Death Tax   Hillary is now pushing a 65% Death Tax. And her own finances are arranged to shield herself from death taxes.Capital Gains Tax Hike   Hillary has proposed the most complex and Byzantine capital gains tax regime in American history, with ten different rates. She raises the top capital gains tax rate from 23.8% to 43.4%.No Corporate Income Tax Rate Relief for Anyone   Hillary offers no income tax rate reduction for any business. The USA has the highest corporate income tax in the world, which kills jobs and makes us less competitive. Even Bill Clinton understands the need to cut the corporate rate.No Personal Income Tax Rate Relief for Anyone   Hillary offers no income tax rate reduction for any American.Carbon Tax   Hillary s campaign has opened the door to a carbon tax if she wins the White House. Democrat Senate Leader Chuck Schumer is also fantasizing about a carbon tax under Hillary, and a carbon tax is part of the official 2016 Democrat party platform.To learn more about Hillary s tax hike plan, visit ATR s dedicated website: www.HighTaxHillary.com ",STUNNING: Hillary’s Own Numbers Show Her Tax Hike Proposals Will Cost American Workers Additional $1 TRILLION

Who wants to support anything this snarky woman promotes? The rude comments go on and on First Lady Melania Trump wasted no time in responding. We give her credit she called it exactly what it was:  attention-seeking and self-serving noise Ivana Trump said she should be considered the  first lady  because she was President Trump s first wife, prompting a stinging rebuke from third wife and current first lady Melania Trump that the remark was  attention-seeking and self-serving noise. Ivana, the mother of Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric, said she has a line to the White House but tries not to call Trump too often because it makes Melania Trump jealous Ouch!Ivana Trump to @arobach: I don't like to call POTUS at the White House: ""I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy"" https://t.co/SiTlUUDX2S pic.twitter.com/nyvSj3Wk9O  Good Morning America (@GMA) October 9, 2017THE FACT THAT IVANA THINKS SHE WOULD CAUSE ANY JEALOUSY IS LAUGHABLE! I have the direct number to White House, but I no really want to call him there because Melania is there,  Ivana told ABC s  Good Morning America  during an interview on Monday.  I don t want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that because I m basically first Trump wife. MELANIA WASTED NO TIME RESPONDING: Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President. She loves living in Washington, DC, and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books,  spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to CNN.  There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex, this is unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise. Ivana Trump, 68, who married Donald Trump in 1977 and divorced him in 1992, has been making the rounds of talk shows to promote her memoir,  Raising Trump,  which was published on Tuesday.WHAT A B*TCH! IVANA THINKS IT MUST BE  TERRIBLE  FOR MELANIA TO BE IN WASHINGTONDespite her comment that she should could carry the mantle of  first lady,  Ivana Trump said she really wouldn t be happy in the White House and wouldn t be willing to change places with Melania. I think for her to be in Washington must be terrible,  Ivana Trump said.  It s better her than me. I would hate Washington. IVANA TAKES A SHOT AT MELANIA!But then she took a veiled shot at the first lady s White House role. Would I straighten up the White House in 14 days? Absolutely. Can I give the speech for 45 minutes without [a] teleprompter? Absolutely. Can I read a contract? Can I negotiate? Can I entertain? Absolutely. But I would not really like to be there. I like my freedom,  she said.Ivana also takes  full credit  for raising their three children because he was  on the telephone making the deals. He was a loving father, don t get me wrong, and he was a good provider, but he was not the father which would take a stroll and go to the Central Park or go play to baseball with them or something,  she said,  It was only until they were about 18 years old [that] he could communicate with them, because he could start to talk business with them.

"October 1, 2016","The chorus of voices saying,  Show us your taxes,  has been growing steadily as Trump continues to hide behind the flimsy excuse of an audit for keeping them hidden. Now, documents obtained by The New York Times may easily explain why he doesn t want the public to see them: While we all have been diligently paying our taxes each year, he very well may not have paid any income taxes at all for the last 18 years.18 years. That s astounding. That s disgusting, particularly for someone with a really fat bank account that s running for President. Trump has likely has paid so much less than his fair share that he helped to bilk the American people out of much needed services.What did the Times find? In 1995, Trump declared a $916 million loss on his taxes. That s a big enough loss to wipe out his federal income tax for the $50,000 to $100,000 he made on each and every episode of  The Apprentice,  and the $45 million he earned serving as chairman of the company that owned his failing casinos in Atlantic City from 1995 to 2009.Joel Rosenfeld, an assistant professor at New York University s Schack Institute of Real Estate, and also a tax expert, told the Times: He has a vast benefit from his destruction. Yes he does. Atlantic City and New Jersey were left picking up the pieces of his failed ventures there. But what s more damning is what Rosenfeld would say if a client came to him with a $916 million loss like Trump s: Do you realize you can create $916 million in income without paying a nickel in taxes? Wow. Yes, Trump was taking advantage of a tax system that s very heavily weighted in favor of real estate investors, and many would say that s just good business. However, just because something is legal doesn t make it right. Furthermore, when the issue of his taxes came up in the debate, and Hillary brought up his bragging that he pays as little as possible in taxes, he said: That makes me smart. Oh please. Smart? Many would say yes. However, that s anything but patriotic or presidential. It s selfish. It s shockingly selfish. It harms the veterans he claims to want to help, and the infrastructure he claims to want to fix, and everything else he claims he can turn around in his quest to enrich himself turn America into a shining golden city on a hill.And yet, this is the biggest example yet of his sheer hypocrisy. So is his campaign s statement on the matter: Mr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required. That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes.Mr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it. No, he wants to tilt it even further towards people like himself. Trump himself hasn t said anything about this on Twitter yet, but expect him to soon. Perhaps at 3 a.m., when he s writhing in fury on his bed that the Times has unmasked him yet again.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images", BREAKING: Trump Tax Documents Leaked And They’re STUNNINGLY Incriminating
"October 1, 2017","Some are saying that Trump has not botched the relief effort in Puerto Rico (Newsflash: He s botched it horribly), but even if that were true, he s doing worse than botching the PR for it. Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 20. On the 22nd, he decided to go golfing for four days, and rage-tweeted at the NFL the whole time. Then he rage-tweeted at the  ingrates  in Puerto Rico who aren t showing him the proper appreciation for what he s not doing. Today, he was at the Presidents Cup golf tournament, avoiding real work and participating in the trophy presentation instead.And while he was there, he decided to dedicate the trophy to the victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. According to Steve Kopack of CNBC, Trump said that conditions in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico are  really under control,  and that he was dedicating the trophy to victims of storms:For those asking, President Trump was speaking on @GolfChannel s coverage of the Presidents Cup trophy presentation.  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) October 1, 2017Here are his own words: On behalf of all of the people of Texas, and all of the people   if you look today and see what is happening, how horrible it is but we have it under really great control   Puerto Rico and the people of Florida who have really suffered over this last short period of time with the hurricanes, I want to just remember them.And we re going to dedicate this trophy to all of those people that went through so much that we love   a part of our great state, really part of our great nation. Because a trophy is seriously what they need right now. Forget disaster relief funds, forget personnel and equipment. Forget food, water and medicine. Forget restoring electricity and communications. What they really need a participation trophy, which is what this amounts to for all the good it ll do.The relief effort is disastrously inadequate in Puerto Rico, where people are starting to suffer from Dengue fever, viral conjunctivitis and Zika. They re at increasing risk for cholera due to the lack of clean drinking water. In fact, the number of people without access to clean drinking water has shot from 44 percent to 55 percent between Wednesday and yesterday, and will continue to rise until we actually get our butts moving with the relief effort there.Furthermore, the contaminated floodwaters are putting Puerto Ricans at risk for hepatitis A, meningitis and salmonella, even if they don t drink it.This isn t just a meaningless gesture, it s damned insulting. You don t dedicate a goddamn trophy, presented at a tournament full of wealthy people who are safe in their well-moneyed cocoons, to hurricane victims. You just don t. It wouldn t be surprising to start hearing more outcry from homeless, sick, and suffering Puerto Ricans   people who are already angry at the lack of response from Trump s administration and his characterization of them as lazy all over Twitter.Featured image via Elsa/Getty Images", Trump Just Dedicated A F**king GOLF TROPHY To People Who Are Suffering In Puerto Rico
"October 10, 2016","Donald Trump s presidential campaign is collapsing, thanks to his poor performance in the presidential debates, a campaign message with limited appeal, and the misogynistic assault comments he made about TV host Nancy O Dell that were released last Friday.Now it seems that groups aligned with Hillary Clinton plan to take advantage of Trump s problems, along with the huge exodus of Republicans who rescinded their support for him over the weekend.Until now, Priorities USA has spent the 2016 election cycle entirely focused on the top of the ticket   getting Clinton elected. The fact that they may use their resources to also promote Democratic candidates in down-ballot races suggests how increasingly confident they are in a Clinton victory.According to a source familiar with the plans, Priorities USA is currently producing television ads to potentially air in Senate contests in North Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania   all competitive races that are also battleground states for the presidential race.Hillary Clinton is relying on Democratic members of Congress to help her enact an agenda and defend President Obama s gains, should she be elected to the office. A so-called  wave  election would go a long way to ensuring that situation be put in place.The last time conditions were similar was in 2008 when President Obama was first elected to the White House. Two years before, Democrats won a ton of seats in the House and Senate which gave them majorities in both bodies. As a result, Democrats were able to get the economic stimulus passed, along with the Affordable Care Act (both without the help of Republicans, who had decided to completely block the Obama agenda, no matter what).Since then Republicans have put in place more so-called  gerrymandered  seats, which are congressional seats whose districts are designed to consistently favor one party over another. Republicans have done this in so many states, it is wildly believed that they have insulated themselves from being dislodged. But not everyone agrees that this majority status lives on forever.Featured image via Flickr"," As Trump Collapses, Team Clinton Makes A HUGE New Move To Crush The GOP"

He s apparently not looking for anyone who has diplomatic negotiating experience though, since he thinks negotiating is negotiating. Noooo he actually wants Ron Burkle, co-owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins, on this team because he believes Burkle is great at negotiating.The Penguins were visiting the White House in the tradition of champion sports teams, where Trump praised Burkle s negotiating abilities and said: Ron, how about negotiating some of our horrible trade deals that they ve made? Here s what I want, I want to get him. Oh, I would love to have Ron Burkle. And it s great to have you Ron. But I really mean that, if you want to get involved in negotiating NAFTA, I like it. Because we re renegotiating NAFTA, Ron. The U.S. is entering its fourth round of NAFTA talks, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s visit to the U.S. tomorrow overlapping that. Trump hates NAFTA in part because he wants trade deals that are heavily even unfairly weighted in our direction. He has threatened to walk away from these talks because he s not getting what he wants.Worse, like the Paris Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he thinks terminating our involvement in international agreements is the best way to get his idea of a good deal: I happen to think that Nafta will have to be terminated if we re going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you can t negotiate a good deal. Said the desert to the grain of sand. This is a man who has bankrupted so many businesses and hurt so many people that way that it s astonishing anyone thinks he s a great businessman.

"October 11, 2016","Steve Bannon, Trump s campaign CEO who was the editor-in-chief at right-wing rag Breitbart, apparently ordered his staff there to destroy Paul Ryan not too long after Ryan took over Boehner s mantle as Speaker of the House.

This was back in December 2015, and now, Bannon s probably thinking they should step up their game after Ryan refused to campaign with Trump. Compared to Trump and Bannon, Ryan is a paragon of human decency. Like any decent human being, he was sickened by the leaked audio tape of Trump saying his celebrity status allowed him to  grab women by the pussy. Trump himself went nuts on Ryan on Twitter after Ryan condemned him, calling him weak and ineffective. He also slammed the entire Republican Party for not standing by him in what his hour of need? Do alpha males even have those?A former Breitbart employee also confirmed that Bannon used to tear into Paul Ryan all the time. Bannon, apparently, can be at least as crazy as Alex Jones when it comes to conspiracy theories. He had his own conspiracy theory about Ryan s succession to House Speaker: [Bannon] goes on these amazing rants. He thinks Paul Ryan is part of a conspiracy with George Soros and Paul Singer, in which elitists want to bring one world government. It also includes a belief that Ryan  masterminded a failed plot to bring down Trump.  It s difficult to get more crazy than this, but this is the man who is Trump s campaign CEO.Of course, people who are close to both Trump and Bannon are framing this latest feud of butthurt as general anger with the establishment, and nothing more. That seems to be an attempt to distance Trump from all the conspiracy nuts, and might be effective if Trump wasn t a conspiracy nut himself.This is probably why Trump wanted Bannon   they re two peas in the crazy pod. One of these days, these two idiots may actually figure out that they re the problem, and not everyone else. But we shouldn t hold our breath for that.

"October 11, 2017","It s pretty clear that Donald Trump has no idea how the country works, or what is actually in the US Constitution.Earlier today, Trump attacked NBC News for reporting unflattering   but true   content about him. The network had first infuriated Trump several days ago when it reported that his Secretary of State had called him a  moron , and most recently the network enraged Trump again by reporting on the reason Rex Tillerson called Trump a moron   which was because Trump wanted to increase the US nuclear arsenal tenfold. For no other reason than because his fragile ego can t handle it, Trump reacted to that story by threatening to take away the press  broadcasting license.Trump made things even worse as the day went on when he actually said,  It s frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write, and people should look into it. Understandably, there was a huge uprising in opposition to all of this, with one of the most brilliant responses coming from CNN s Jake Tapper. During the opening of his show The Lead, Tapper responded to Trump by telling him to go read the Constitution. With a pocket Constitution in hand, Tapper told Trump,  You might want to start looking into it too, Mr. President.

"October 12, 2016","Trump s supporters, and some in the press, believe that if it wasn t for Trump being a disgusting sexual predator, Hillary Clinton would have been done when Wikileaks released a bunch of emails from her campaign. However, an aide to Hillary, John Podesta, has made an interesting connection, too. One of Trump s close allies, Roger Stone, communicates with Wikileaks.And Stone has just admitted to it. I do have a back-channel communication with Assange, because we have a good mutual friend,  Stone told CBS4 News [Miami] Wednesday evening.  That friend travels back and forth from the United States to London and we talk. I had dinner with him last Monday.' He claims he doesn t have direct communication with Assange, though, and he insists he has nothing to do with their email dump. Democrats and U.S. officials believe that Wikileaks might be working with Russia on this, which wouldn t be surprising since they hacked the DNC over the summer and are showing interest in trying to rig our election.Podesta has also accused Stone of having advance knowledge of what was going to be in Wikileaks  email dump   an accusation that Stone flatly denies: I have a back-channel communications with WikiLeaks,  Stone told NBC News.  But they certainly don t clear or tell me in advance what they re going to do.' What s the point of the communication, then? Given what Wikileaks is busy doing trying to expose Hillary as corrupt, which could tilt the election in Trump s favor it s not really all that difficult to imagine that this  back-channel communication  is actually collusion directly between Stone and Assange.In fact, back in August, Stone said he was in direct communication with Assange and that they were actively working to bring down Hillary s campaign. Speaking to the Southwest Broward Republican Organization, Stone referred directly to the so-called  October surprise,  saying, according to Mediaite: Well, it could be any number of things. I actually have communicated with Assange. I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there s no telling what the October surprise may be. Lately, it seems that everything anyone involved with Trump tries to do to bring Hillary and the Democrats down backfires. If Stone communicates with Wikileaks, that implicates the Trump campaign. He s admitted to back-channel communication. He has said he s spoken to Assange, although he denies it now. This won t look good for Trump s already faltering campaign.Featured image via Ben Jackson/Getty Images for SiriusXM", Close Trump Ally Just ADMITTED He Communicates With Wikileaks

The song is played as the American flag is brought down the pole at the end of the day and secured for the night.The Commander-in-Chief of nine months had no idea what was happening as the song began to play.

Now, it s not like Donald Trump was  in uniform  as the official leader of America s military while he sat there with the second-biggest* asshole on television.

He s appealed to their bosses, he s attempted to turn America against them, and he s generally been the most racist asshat on the planet about the whole process.Now we see that his offense at the NFL protests had nothing to do with patriotism, but with trying to dictate where and when it was okay for black people to protest.*the biggest asshole on television without question is Pat RobertsonFeatured image via Stephen Chernin/Getty Images"," After Whining About NFL ‘Disrespect,’ Trump Laughs And Jokes During Military Ceremony"
"October 13, 2016","Donald Trump has often campaigned as the self-described  law and order  candidate in the 2016 presidential election. But one of the men Trump tried to persecute is speaking out against the reality TV star.As recently as last week, Trump argued that the Central Park Five should be behind bars. The men were five young black men who were railroaded by the criminal justice system and falsely accused of raping a white woman (known as the Central Park Jogger). Eventually, after they were imprisoned, another man was connected to the crime via DNA evidence and the Five were released. They received a court judgment and were rewarded monetary damages for their unjust incarceration.Trump took out a full-page ad during the trial, calling for the boys  execution. Now, one of those men, Yusef Salaam, is speaking out about Trump and his incitement and what Salaam describes as  calling basically for us to be murdered. Yusef Salaam said Donald Trump s infamous full-page ad calling for the deaths of the Central Park Five would in an earlier era been the impetus that sparked  mob justice    in a new ad against Trump. They had our names, our phone numbers and addresses in the papers so what would ve happened? Somebody from the darkest places of society would ve come to our homes, kicked in our doors, and drug us from our homes and hung us from the trees in Central Park. That would ve been the type of mob justice that they were seeking. Trump still refuses to accept that these men are innocent, part of a troubling pattern from the Republican nominee in a blas  attitude towards black concerns and safety. Asked during the debates about police brutality against blacks and the protests of the Black Lives Matter movement, Trump has instead gone at length about  stop and frisk  and inner city crime.

While dealing with multiple ethical issues and investigations, the administration never gets a day of rest as they are in constant reaction mode and doing damage control on his constant blunders. Today was the perfect example of an administration that is hanging on by a thread.Earlier today, Trump displayed his blatant stupidity as he gave a speech at the conservative Values Voter Summit. During that speech, Trump shocked over 3,000 attendees (and the world) when he said he d met with the  president of the Virgin Islands.  This was Trump s direct quote: I went to Puerto Rico, and I met with the president of the Virgin Islands, these are people that are incredible people. They ve suffered gravely, and we ll be there. We re gonna be there. We have, really, it s not even a question of a choice   we re going to be there as Americans. Trump apparently doesn t know that HE is the president of the Virgin Islands, because the islands are a part of American territory! As expected, Twitter dragged Trump for this: There s really no way to gracefully fix this, but still the Trump administration had to try. In a half-ass, hilarious attempt to minimize Trump s very obvious f*ck up, the White House released a transcript of Trump s remarks   and crossed out the word  president  and replaced it with the correction of  governor of the Virgin Islands.

"October 14, 2016","The FBI thwarted an act of domestic terrorism on Friday when they arrested three white men for plotting to blow up an apartment complex in Kansas.Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright, and Patrick Stein were all taken into custody after an investigation that took eight months busted the trio for planning a massive terrorist attack in Garden City.Their target was an apartment complex and a mosque that serviced 120 Somali refugees.According to KWCH, United States Attorney Tom Beall said  the men stockpiled a large cache of firearms, and ammunition. Beall said the men planned to park vehicles full of explosives at all four corners of the Garden City apartment complex. The men said they wanted to  wake people up .Beall said the men wrote a manifesto, which they wanted published after the bombing.According to an affidavit, the were a part of a group called the Kansas Security Force and the Crusaders. These are militia groups whose members support and espouse sovereign citizen, anti-government, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs,  read the affidavit.The three men had planned to carry out the attack on November 9th, one day after Election Day.And as it turns out, Curtis Allen is a supporter of Donald Trump and his Facebook page is full of anti-Muslim rhetoric. I personally back Donald Trump,  an unhinged Allen wrote in a post ranting about how Hillary Clinton is supposedly going to put Americans in FEMA camps and take all guns away.Allen was also particularly paranoid about Muslims. Here is just a sampling of his posts.Clearly, this guy hates Muslims, and his hate and paranoia was only perpetuated by Republican nominee Donald Trump.Trump has built his campaign on bashing Muslims, especially Muslim refugees. So Allen decided to join with two other guys in an effort to kill Muslims. Whether the other two are Trump supporters as well is not known, but this is how dangerous Donald Trump has become in our country. He is making right-wing nut jobs blood thirsty and paranoid enough to commit acts of domestic terrorism.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images", BREAKING: Trump Supporters Busted By FBI For Plotting MASSIVE Terrorist Attack

"October 15, 2016","When you see a Trump supporter parroting his blatantly false talking point about the electoral process being  rigged,  just send them to istheelectionrigged.com.Recent polls have been disappointing for Trump and his followers, to say the least. In response they ve began to accuse the election of being rigged, but where is there proof? Because we have plenty of facts that say otherwise.The electoral process in America is thorough, to say the least. Thorough enough to earn the United States an 11/12 score on the electoral process from Freedom House, an independent, nonprofit organization that rates democratic institutions. You can find their reasoning through the link above.Voter fraud, for example, is virtually nonexistent. In 2014, a study showed that out of a billion ballots casted since 2000, there s only been 31 cases of voter fraud. So where s this fraud Trump is talking about? Oh, wait, it s just another one of his lies.The right-wing really screwed us over when they chose Trump as their candidate. He s brought nothing good to our country, ever. Donald Trump is a child, and what do children do when they don t get their way? They whine, saying it s unfair or try to blame it on someone else. There is no fraud going on in our election, Donald is just running out of excuses. He s a liar, just saying what people want to hear. His supporters are the type of people to follow blindly, never actually doing the research themselves   otherwise they wouldn t be his supporters. This is slightly worrisome, especially with recent talk of taking up arms against the corruption. Trump s rhetoric is undermining faith in United States democracy, with absolutely no evidence of fraud or wrongdoing. He s taking advantage of low information voters and, through his own narcissism and grand stupidity, may cause violence to break out when he inevitably loses (make sure to vote!).There s no proof of fraud or  rigging  in our electoral process, and there s been plenty to disprove it. Unfortunately, it s incredibly doubtful that this news will stop Trump and his supporters from angrily blaming the system for Trump s failure."," When You See A Trump Supporter Calling The Election ‘Rigged,’ This Is The PERFECT Reply"
"October 15, 2017","Christian cake baker Jack Phillips gained national infamy when he violated Colorado s non-discrimination law by refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple s wedding. He was subsequently sued, and now his case is headed to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, with the current makeup of the court and Donald Trump s administration in place, it is quite likely that discrimination will be codified into law. Nonetheless, The Satanic Temple has come up with a brilliant way to point out that religious freedom cuts both ways: By having these bigoted bakers make cakes for Satan.Jack Phillips has already had his first request via email from a Satanist seeking to celebrate Satan. It reads:Dear Mr PhillipsI would like to get a quote on a birthday cake, for a special event. It is a cake that is religious in theme, and since religion is a protected class, I am hoping that you will gladly bake this cake. As you see the birthday cake in question is to celebrate the birthday of Lucifer, or as they are also known Satan who was born as Satan when he was cast from heaven by God. The cake only needs to be a simple 9 13 single layer cake, with red and black icing. As well as to contain an upside down cross, under the head of Lucifer. And I thought I would seek you out, to bake this cake since you appear to be a very moral person since you refused to bake a cake for same sex couples. And since religion is a protected class, I hope you will be willing to bake this cake, so my small group of religious friends can celebrate the birthday of Lucifer this coming November, just a few days after Halloween.Sincerely,(Name redacted)Here is a sample cake posted to Twitter by The Satanic Temple s co-founder, Lucien Greaves:Did you know: bakers can't refuse service to The Satanic Temple because religion is a ""protected class""? #SatanCakes pic.twitter.com/9VrVndkbSi  Lucien Greaves (@LucienGreaves) September 26, 2017The whole point here is not to torment bakers or anyone else. It is to point out that if you own a business that is open to the public, you may not discriminate, period. Now, at the federal level there are no non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. However, religion   EVERY religion   is a protected class. If Jack Phillips or anyone else refuses the Satanists their cakes, this will be an open and shut court case.Mr. Phillips, it would have been a hell of a lot easier if you had just baked the damn wedding cake.Here is video of the Temple s co-founder explaining his position:Featured image via video screen capture", Satanists Brilliantly Troll Anti-Gay Baker By Requesting A Birthday Cake For Lucifer (VIDEO)

Todd asked the vice president why Trump didn t deserve to get the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the sexual assault allegations against him that have been piling up. Biden s answer was simple:  His own words. His own words, I don t even have to go to the accusers,  Biden explained.  When a man says what he said, that is a textbook definition of sexual assault. I mean, it s a textbook definition. But what makes it believable that he engaged in that kind of activity, it s not that just that he said it, but sort of his instinctive abuse of power. He acts like that in private sector and he acts in the way he treats employees,  he continued.  You know,  I live in the penthouse. I m a billionaire, I m a star and I can do what I want.

During his interviews, he rated women on a scale from one to ten, told Stern it was okay to call his daughter Ivanka a  piece of ass,  and bragged about his own sex life. (I ll wait while you gag.) These comments have come back to bite Trump in his orange derriere repeatedly throughout his run for the White House.Howard Stern, who happens to be a Democrat, is finally commenting on the impact his past shows have had on this year s election. He said that having the billionaire on his show to talk about sex and degrade women was no accident, Trump fit the part by nature. Stern also said that he was not replaying the tapes of the GOP nominee s old interviews because he considers Trump a friend and doing so would be a  betrayal. Donald Trump did the show in an effort to be entertaining and have fun with us,  Stern said on his Sirius satellite radio show.  I fully knew what I was doing when I interviewed Trump. I knew I had a guy who loved to talk about sex.   I had a guy who loved to evaluate women on a scale of 1 to 10. These are avenues I went down because I knew it would entertain the audience. Stern said that he was stunned that the tapes from his show hadn t surfaced earlier. He added that he had asked Trump what the heck he was thinking when he launched his bid for the presidency. I said,  Why are you doing this? Why would a guy with billions of dollars (run for president)?   Don t you know what they re gonna do to you? Don t you know they re gonna open up everything?'

"October 17, 2017","After two days of controversy over Donald Trump s lack of response, attention, or even seeming to notice the four soldiers who died in an ambush in Niger nearly two weeks ago, he finally called the pregnant widow of one of the fallen soldiers, Sergeant LaDavid Johnson. At Miami International Airport, where she awaited the remains of her 25-year-old husband, Myeshia Johnson took the president s 5-minute call.On hand with Myeshia Johnson was Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, the US Representative from Johnson s district. Wilson has been critical of Trump s response   or lack of one   for longer than this has even been in the national spotlight. Sgt. Johnson s body was left behind after the ambush, and not recovered by the military for two days after the operation. Many questions remain about the ambush, the operation, and the planning that went into the entire effort. Some consider Trump s bluster on calling military families and his attack on President Barack Obama to be a distraction from those questions that have arisen.According to Rep Wilson, the phone call was  insensitive and insane,  and if accurate, what she conveyed from Sgt. Johnson s widow is possibly the worst thing anyone has ever said to the widow of a soldier, let alone the worst thing a president has said. Trump told Mrs. Johnson, He knew what he signed up for But when it happens it hurts anyway. Those are the words of a man who has either never suffered a loss or has never cared about one.The call was first reported by Ross Palombo, the Washington Bureau Chief for an ABC affiliate in Miami. After Palombo tweeted about the Congresswoman s account of the call, he was contacted by the White House, only for officials to chide him and tell him that the affair was none of his business:BREAKNG: Top White House official tells me about @realDonaldTrump comment to soldier s widow  The President s conversations with the families of American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice are private.  @WPLGLocal10  Ross Palombo (@RossPalombo) October 18, 2017This kind of response is, unfortunately, just what America has come to expect from the disgusting Donald Trump and his cohorts in the White House.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images"," Trump Finally Delivers On Promised Phone Call To Soldier’s Wife, Says The Most Disgusting Thing EVER"

So every time someone seems scared of them, it s another boost to their ego.Fortunately, most people are in on the joke at this point, and state and local leaders have become more accustomed to the violence that neo-Nazi rallies bring with them. Even businesses have gotten in on trolling Richard Spencer and his pathetic band of white supremacist losers.Case in point: Alligator Brewing, a craft beer maker located in Tall Paul s Brewhouse in Gainesville had an amazing idea the other day   to allow anyone holding two tickets to Spencer s event at UF to come trade them in for a free beer: Ticket become available this Saturday, October 14th and each person can get two with a valid ID.

"October 2, 2016","For years Republicans have been screaming about the  takers  in our society, which to them include minorities, the middle class, and immigrants, undocumented or not.But a recent expose in the New York Times shows that their candidate for President of the United States, Donald Trump, may have used his 1995 losses (which equate to almost $1 billion) to get out of 18 years of federal income tax payments. The self described  billionaire  (who knows if that s even true), recently told the whole world that not paying taxes makes him smart. His surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie, say he s  brilliant  for avoiding his tax obligations for almost 20 years.No, morons, it doesn t make you smart, it makes you a freeloader and a con artist.But besides from the glaring truth, one group in particular actually pays more in taxes than Donald Trump, and they re the people he hates the most: undocumented immigrants.In our society, people seem to think immigrants (or  Mexicans,  as they blanket them), are coming into this country, sucking up our resources while paying absolutely nothing back to the society that they live in. Silly Republicans, that s Donald Trump you re thinking of.According to a 2016 study from Institute on Taxation & Economic Policy showed that undocumented immigrants pay upwards of $1.1 billion in personal income taxes (out of a grand total of $12 billion paid in taxes   including property, sales, other goods and services:Various studies have estimated between 50 and 75 percent of undocumented immigrants currently pay personal income taxes using either false social security (SSN) or individual tax identification (ITIN) numbers   Undocumented immigrants are currently ineligible to receive the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and state versions of the credit because they lack the legal authority to work in the U.S. Accordingly, the impact of state EITCs has been removed from the current personal income tax estimates. This has the effect of increasing the effective income tax rates paid by these undocumented taxpayers under current law.Trump, who has made demonizing hardworking immigrants a staple in his twisted, divisive and racist campaign, literally (as far as we know until he releases his tax returns) pays less than undocumented immigrants in personal income.Let that sink in.While these immigrants are paying for our troops, military, veterans, and social programs that keep millions out of poverty, Trump is skipping out   while simultaneously pretending to care about all these issues.And of course his supporters are eating it up, and they campaign is neither confirming nor denying his cheating, slimy ways.Bottom line, Donald Trump contributes less (or even nothing) to our military and future generations than the immigrants he wants to cruelly deport, and that should be enough to show the American people what a fraud and con artist he really is.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images", Even Undocumented Immigrants Pay More Income Taxes Than Donald Trump
"October 2, 2017","Like increasing numbers of heartless people on the right, Bill O Reilly has weighed in on the Las Vegas massacre with one of the worst things you can say about any mass shooting. The former Fox News host is an avid 2nd Amendment  fan,  meaning he believes that guns are more important than people s lives, and he reminded us that he feels that way in an absolutely disgusting blog post today. The NRA and its supporters want easy access to weapons, while the left wants them banned,  he says. Sorry, but  easy access to weapons  is a big part of the problem. Stephen Paddock had multiple firearms and clips, and over 100 rounds of ammunition. In videos of the shooting you can hear the rapid fire of assault weapons. Guns are already too easy to get.The fact that Paddock managed to kill over 50 people and wound more than 500 more from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, which has no balconies or patios, is proof positive that more guns is not the answer. All the  good guys with guns  in the world would not have stopped that. But the above isn t what makes Billo the Clown so repugnant right now. It s what he said afterward, about the price of freedom, that s so vile: This is the price of freedom. Violent nuts are allowed to roam free until they do damage, no matter how threatening they are.The Second Amendment is clear that Americans have a right to arm themselves for protection. Even the loons. Three words come to mind: FUCK. OFF. ASSHOLE. The 2nd Amendment makes clear no such thing. All we can conclude from this is that NRA-types like him no longer value American lives. If they did, they d be calling up all their Congresspeople (like we all should be doing right now) and demanding a thorough review of current federal laws regarding gun ownership to determine how best to prevent things like this in the future. They d be calling their state lawmakers (again, like we all should be doing) and demanding their states do the same thing.The House is supposed to vote on a law that loosens regulations on silencers today. How bad would it have been if Paddock had managed to silence his weapon? It would have taken longer for people to figure out what was happening and even more would have died. But conservatives, both Republican and Democrat, are saying,  Oh, we have to protect the hearing of hunters and sport shooters.  Really? This target shooter knows there are squillions of other ways to do that.  Protecting people s hearing,  is a ridiculous and tone-deaf rationalization for what they re about to do.

Speaker Pro Tem Peggy Mast, R-Emporia, who happens to also be the No. 3 Republican in the Kansas House, posted the offensive quote to her Facebook page.Great quote from Hitler in the video,  she wrote on Thursday morning, in a post that contained no video.  Please listen to it closely. His words are profound! Let s start using discernment. Christie Kriegshauser, House Speaker Ray Merrick s chief of staff, failed to follow Mast s line of thinking. Sorry, I m confused,  Kriegshauser wrote in response to her first post.  What video and how is there a great quote from Hitler? Although Mast did not return phone calls, she did take to Facebook yet again to, ahem, clarify what she meant by touting quotes from the leader of the Third Reich. She claimed that she  was not in any way agreeing with Hitler s words,  and was just trying to compare him to Planned Parenthood.About an hour later, she added a link to an article from JulieRoys.com, a Christian blog, to her Facebook page. The article contained a video of anti-abortion activist Gianna Jessen giving testimony to Congress regarding Planned Parenthood. In her testimony, Jessen quoted Hitler and argued that he used the same kind of propaganda as the women s health provider. The receptivity of the masses is very limited, their intelligence is small, but their power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these facts, all effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these in slogans until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand by your slogan,  Hitler said in the quote. Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of Kansas Interfaith Action, a group that fights against racism, was also unimpressed with Mast s post. There s nothing profound, and there s no room in American politics for the words or thought of Adolph Hitler,  Reiber said.In one of her Nazi-loving Facebook posts, Mast wrote:  To clarify the intent of my previous post: Planned Parenthood has learned well the same tactics and deception used by Hitler regarding innocent lives.   I was making a connection between the ideology he used and the arguments made by Planned Parenthood. In an email, Laura McQuade, president of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes, wrote that Planned Parenthood  is a trusted health care provider for thousands of Kansans and we reject and condemn Representative Peggy Mast s offensive remarks. Thankfully, Mast is not running for re-election.Featured image via YouTube", This Kansas Republican Thought Touting ‘Profound’ Hitler Quote Was A Good Idea – It Wasn’t
"October 20, 2017","Donald Trump is having a hard time recovering from his fallen soldier debacle, not only because he continues to make it worse, but because America is tired of his nonsense and demands the truth.It was only yesterday that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly infuriated everyone by criticizing Rep. Frederica Wilson for calling Trump out for disrespecting a Gold Star widow. Kelly also went after Wilson for an old speech in 2015, stating that she d bragged about how she had gotten money for the FBI acknowledging two deceased agents. Little did Kelly know, this lie would ignite a sh*tstorm for the Trump administration.Earlier today, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was the unfortunate recipient of the media s frustration with the dishonest Trump administration. Reporters blasted Sanders with questions in the press briefing, directly pointing out that Wilson s FBI speech completely contradicted Kelly s claims. When a reporter boldly pointed out that Wilson had never boasted about funding in her speech, Sanders stumbled through her response: Absolutely, General Kelly was stunned that Representative Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain FBI agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation. As he pointed out, if you re able to make a sacred act like honoring American heroes all about yourself, you re an empty barrel. Or as we say in the South, all hat, no cattle. This was hardly the end for Sanders. Because she d defended Kelly despite being faced with facts that challenged his claims, reporters attacked her and asked if she d even seen the speech. Sanders claimed she had, and a reporter pointed out that she should know that Wilson actually praised the FBI agents and didn t talk about funding. Even as her spot was completely blown up, Sanders pathetically defended Kelly.The icing on the cake was when a reporter asked if Kelly would respond to more questions over the matter. When Sanders said he already had yesterday, the reporter pointed out: He was wrong yesterday! As usual, the Trump administration responded with intimidation and bullying. Sanders fired back: If you want to go after General Kelly, that s up to you. If you want to get into a debate with the four-star Marine general, I think that s something highly inappropriate. Go ahead. You can watch Sanders get grilled by reporters below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images", WATCH: Reporters DRAG Sarah Huckabee Sanders In Brilliant Fact-Check (VIDEO)
"October 21, 2016","Donald Trump probably thought that running for president would be a huge boon for all his businesses. However, it s starting to look as though that may not be anything like true. Trump Hotels just announced that they re dropping Trump s name from all their new hotels. His name will stay on existing hotels, but new ones will carry the name  Scion. According to Travel and Leisure, the company insists that this move is an attempt to reach Millennials, and has nothing to do with how Trump may have damaged his own brand. They re ignoring the fact that Trump s newest hotel, built inside the historic Post Office building in D.C., actually had to reduce prices to fill rooms during the peak season.But worse than that   they had to drop prices below $500 per night to try and get people in for the International Monetary Fund conference two weeks ago.Every other luxury hotel in that same area sold out weeks ahead of time for that conference, while Trump International struggled to attract guests. As New York Magazine put it: For a five-star hotel in downtown Washington to have vacancies during major IMF meetings is a little like having empty rooms when the Super Bowl is in town.  The reason why there were vacancies is the political atmosphere. People don t want to go there for fear that they would be asked,  Why are you staying here?  says Ada Pena, a travel agent with ABA Travel in Washington, D.C. In addition to that, reservations throughout the company have plunged by well over 50 percent, too, showing that Trump s absurd campaign is destroying his name. A destroyed name means a destroyed brand   he s not nearly the wonderful, amazing, brilliant person and businessman he believes himself to be.It s so bad that, on Oct. 7, Mark Cuban tweeted that Bernard Madoff had a better brand than Trump. For those that don t know, Madoff was behind one of the biggest Ponzi schemes this country ever saw, and is now behind bars. That s how toxic Cuban believes Trump has become to his own businesses.Every single @realDonaldTrump hotel and golf course is toast. Done. Over. Bernie Madoff now has a better brand.  Mark Cuban (@mcuban) October 8, 2016Trump s bragging about being able to sexually assault women definitely doesn t help.

"October 21, 2017","Donald Trump and his disgraceful team deserve to be throttled for their horrendous responses and disrespect to Gold Star families, particularly after Rep. Fredericka Wilson called Trump out on his insensitive remarks to the widow of a fallen soldier.After both Trump and his Chief of Staff, John Kelly, attacked Wilson and lied their a**es off to clear Trump s name, MSNBC anchor Joy Reid brought on a guest that would make Trump sorry he ever challenged Wilson. Noting that Wilson was currently at the funeral of fallen soldier La David Johnson while Trump was playing golf, Reid said: She is at that funeral as we speak. While General Kelly and his boss, Donald Trump, are still standing by their attacks on her. Like I said, extraordinary. Then, she turned to one of her guests, retired Colonel Jack Jacobs, and asked: Donald Trump likes to hide behind his generals, he likes to push them out front in order to give himself credibility. What do you make of General Kelly s willingness to be used in that way this week and then to add this extraneous story that turns up not even to be true slamming the congresswoman? It was as if Jacobs, a Medal of Honor recipient, had been waiting all day for the opportunity to rip Trump and Kelly apart. He said: Well, it s quite surprising because I know   I don t know him very well, I m not that close to him   but I know General Kelly I m quite surprised. Attacks like this don t make any sense from anybody. The retired colonel, who is also the recipient of two Silver Stars, three Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts, also stated that Trump and Kelly owed Wilson an apology: If it were I, I would. I mean, I d pick up the phone and say,  look, this has gone far enough, I apologize.  But that should have been the case from the very beginning when whatever is emanating from the White House was inaccurate as well. And the trashing continued with this brilliant attack: I can say this about Donald Trump, he s not real good at talking. If I were Trump, I would have picked up the phone and said,  look, that was my ham-handed way of being sympathetic, I m not good at that and I apologize.  And all this stuff would have been over. Another guest, a former combat veteran, agreed with Jacobs, while Reid reminded everyone that  It s not going to stop because Donald Trump this morning, got up bright and early and starting tweeting again attacking Congresswoman Wilson. So Donald Trump doesn t want it to end and he doesn t want the discussion to be about the fact it took him 13 days to call the families of these four fallen soldiers. He wants it to be about Congresswoman Wilson. Here s that tweet:As usual, Trump just makes things worse for himself. Jacobs was dead on when he stated that Trump could have easily ended this whole debacle by apologizing for his disgusting response and all the lies. But because he s Trump, we all knew that wasn t going to happen. Trump has gotten himself into this mess, and now he must pay the price.You can watch Jacobs crush Trump below: Featured image is a screenshot", Trump And John Kelly Just Got RIPPED APART By A Medal Of Honor Recipient (VIDEO)
"October 22, 2016","During all the fallout from the  Access Hollywood  tape that first revealed Donald Trump to be a sexual predator, and now, with all the women coming forward to accuse him of sexual assault, Ivanka has stood staunchly by her father. It seems, though, that such support is hurting her own business. Ivanka has a clothing line, which is sold in stores like TJ Maxx, but women who ve been forced to relive their own pain from sexual assault because of Trump are boycotting Ivanka s brand.Cosmopolitan spoke to Lindsey Ledford, a sexual assault survivor, about what seeing the Trump name on a blouse did to her: My first thought was,  Grab them by the pussy. We can do anything we want. Don t even ask,  Ledford told Cosmopolitan.com. The blouse was triggering traumatic flashbacks to physical abuse she d suffered in the past, and to times she d been grabbed or groped by men without her consent.  None of them ever asked how I felt, what I was thinking, or what I wanted. They didn t wait,  she wrote in a flurry of tweets at T.J. Maxx after fleeing the store.  That is what  Trump  means to me,  she told me: complete disregard for women and their bodies.  It doesn t matter if Ivanka s name is in front of it, or Donald s.' There s a growing coalition of women who are working to boycott both Ivanka s brand and the stores that carry it because it s too closely linked to Donald Trump. This plan came about because of Shannon Coulter, the CEO of a boutique marketing agency, just after the  Access Hollywood  tape came out. She tweeted:Not enough to not buy Ivanka s collection. She campaigns for him. We should avoid stores that carry it. #fashionnotfascism #ivankant  Shannon Coulter ? (@shannoncoulter) October 12, 2016Ivanka herself has said that she s a daughter, not a surrogate, and it s been hard for women to condemn her for supporting her father because it s hard to be objective about family members. However, increasing numbers of women see Ivanka as representative of a culture that demeans women to the point where it s okay to harass and assault them.Cosmopolitan also spoke to several other women. One said her revulsion at seeing Ivanka s name inside a shoe was a  visceral response,  because her attacker used almost the exact methods Trump spoke of in his tape.Another woman threw out some pumps from Ivanka s line, and refused to shop at stores that carried the brand, when it came to her wedding.  My wedding is a day of love. I m not going to wear clothes that represent hate,  she said.Those who are busy defending Trump don t really seem to know or care what this revelation has done to women all over the country. Perhaps worse, especially for women, is that Ivanka has actually defended her father s vile treatment of women: He recognizes it was crude language. He was embarrassed that he said those things, and he apologized. That s not language consistent with any conversation I ve ever had with him, or any conversation I ve ever overheard, so it was a bit jarring to hear. I think he was sincere in his apology. It s hard for women who have been harassed and assaulted to listen to a fellow woman defend the very type of predator that hurt them. Although Ivanka s brand hasn t yet lost a ton of business, this boycott movement will likely grow as her father makes increasingly disgusting remarks about how he s going to get his revenge on the women accusing him of assault. That will be particularly true if she continues to openly defend him.Featured image by Joe Scarnici via Getty Images", Ivanka’s Clothing Line Could Be In A LOT Of Trouble Because Her Father Is A Sick Sexual Predator
"October 22, 2017","Rex Tillerson was right. Donald Trump is a f*cking moron.After years of slamming polls as  fake,  Trump had the nerve to tout a poll on Sunday morning after Fox & Friends reported on it.The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll results show that 46 percent of respondents think the media fabricates stories about Trump.So, of course, the poll sent Trump to Twitter so he could literally scream about it and claim that his constant labeling of news outlets as  fake news  are  sinking through It is finally sinking through. 46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS, even worse! Lost cred.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2017Let s all keep in mind that this is ONE poll. Furthermore, the results were largely split down partisan lines, with 76 percent of Republicans believing that the news media make up stories about Trump. That number rises to 85 percent among Trump s most ardent supporters.If this poll had the opposite results, Trump would be dismissing it as a fake. And we all know it.Trump only thinks news stories and polls are accurate when they kiss his ass. That s why Fox & Friends is watched by Trump on a daily basis. They not only kiss his ass, they practically give him a blow-job every morning.Back in July, a PPP poll showed that a majority of Americans trust the news media more than they trust Trump.Over 50 percent of Americans said they trust NBC, CNN, ABC, the New York Times, and The Washington Post more than they trust Trump. The percentage of people who said they trust Trump more only hovered in the mid-30s.You know what else currently stands in the mid-30s? Trump s approval rating. The latest Gallup poll shows that only 35 percent of Americans approve of Trump s job performance. The Politico poll has it at 44 percent, so you can probably guess which poll Trump will call  fake.

This is never thrown into sharper relief than buy the extreme shifts in policy positions since he decided to run for president as a Republican. In doing so, Trump read the tea leaves when it comes to what it takes to appeal to the bigoted GOP base.

"October 23, 2017"," I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ. That s a pretty easy quote from Gandhi to understand. The man was complicated and problematic in a lot of ways, but this one quote never loses its edge for me, because it s so simple.I have no doubt, however, that firebrand GOP Senate hopeful Roy Moore would dismiss it as the ramblings of a skinny brown cultist. I mean, Hinduism has to be a cult, since there s no story of a savior coming back from the dead, no fire and brimstone and angry gods. I mean, there are, but not Roy s angry God.Roy s angry God is apparently the guy responsible for the murders of 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary five years ago this December. You see, Roy s God is the one from the Old Testament of the Bible, and the book that Roy gets this particular idea from was apparently written 800 years before Christ came around. Laws were different then. You couldn t eat shrimp or cut your hair at the temples, and I guess if you were a biblical lady, you probably should have been essentially in hiding the entire time you menstruated, because holy shit, was that frowned on.In fact, that book of the Bible, Hosea, has 197 verses in it, and they re essentially all about how terrible everyone is, and how God wants to smite them because they don t love Him enough.They turned away from the Laws Of God, you see, and that meant the Almighty laid the smack down on them. Translated into current context, Roy Moore says, that means God instructed Adam Lanza to pull the trigger on those children and eventually himself, because America, like the Northern Kingdom of Israel before her, is worshiping false idols.Personally, I think Hosea himself was just an angry dude. His wife (Gomer) cheated on him, and God made him give his kids funny names, and he wasn t even sure if the last kid was his  Well, the story s pretty convoluted, really, but suffice it to say, if I had been designated as one of God s main spokesmen and I was going through some shit like Hosea was, I can imagine telling my wife that all the bad things happening to her were happening because she was a sinner.It s not very Christian, though.In fact, it s pretty gross.

"October 24, 2016","Trump has been very clear for the last week or so   he will not accept the results of Election Night if he s not the winner. He even said at a rally in Ohio: I would like to promise and pledge, to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election   if I win. He also told Chris Wallace, the moderator of the final presidential debate, that he will keep us all in suspense until Election Night is over. And he s made noises about contesting the results if Hillary wins, presumably because there s no way  Crooked Hillary  could win in his world.He s in for a shocker, though. Election law doesn t really allow a candidate to just contest election results because he s butthurt over losing. We have 43 states that allow losing candidates to call for recounts, and half of those have  trigger margins,  where a recount is automatically triggered when the vote is within those margins.They re typically very narrow, though. If Trump is hoping that automatic recounts will be triggered in some of the battleground states, he will probably be badly disappointed. If he thinks he can just say,  I don t like the results in that state, please recount,  because he thinks that s what Al Gore did in 2000, he s got another think coming. Despite that, he s actually said: If Al Gore and George Bush had agreed three weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case. I m being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters. The truth there is that Florida s results were so close that their automatic recount was triggered. That, in turn, led to the longest, most annoying dramatic presidential election imaginable.Electoral votes are sent on to the Senate for certification in early January, and then the Senate President, who s actually Joe Biden, signs off. It s not likely that very many in Congress will want to help draw out Trump s drama if the election s results are clear in their view (which very well could be different from  clear  in Trump s view).Trump has taken a ton of flak for his cries of  RIGGED!  and for his statements that he might not accept the results if he loses. That could be true even if he loses bigly, despite his claims of being willing to accept a clear result. He ll no doubt make noises about sending investigators to all the battleground states that went to Hillary to check for the widespread fraud he ll be sure gave her the win. He won t concede, which many don t like. Even Sen. John McCain, who lost to Obama in 2008 and had to swallow that loss and give a concession speech, says: I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance. A concession isn t just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader s first responsibility. Trump isn t a leader, though. He s a narcissistic toddler who plans on screaming and crying and stomping his feet in front of all of America on Nov. 8 if he loses. He ll have so much fun watching Paul Ryan, possibly alongside Mitch McConnell, give his concession speech for him.Featured image by Mark Makela via Getty Images", Trump In For TREMENDOUS Shock If He Thinks He Can Just Refuse To Accept Election Night Loss

If he wasn t, he wouldn t be threatening lawsuits against everyone under the sun, and promising to change libel laws so it s easier to sue media outlets that dare to report bad things about him (even if they re true). At a private lunch, years ago, when Richard Branson was expecting to just talk with Trump about whatever over lunch, it turned out that all Trump could talk about was his bankrupt companies and the people who d refused to help him financially.In an interview on CNN, Branson flat-out said: It was just the two of us. I was expecting an interesting lunch talking about various things in the world.And instead I got a lunch where all he talked about was his bankrupt companies. Then Trump said that he d tried to get help from five different people, all of whom had told him, more or less, to go fuck himself. Branson then said what Trump had planned for those people: And then he spent the rest of this lunch telling me how he was going to spend the rest of his life destroying those five people. He s also hell bent on destroying any press outlets, like The New York Times, that won t make him look good. And he s obsessed with destroying the women who have accused him of sexual assault, because they aren t helping him either.Maybe Trump had lunch with Branson because he was hoping Branson would help him out financially? Branson is only the 288th wealthiest person in the world, but Trump is 335th, according to Forbes. That s this year. Several years ago, when this lunch took place, Trump may have been in considerably worse shape. Certainly his companies were in terrible shape.Branson went on to say that Trump s vindictive nature is dangerous for America. In fact, he couldn t believe that such a vengeful and petty man would even get this far in a presidential election. He s hoping he can get through to people who think Trump is wonderful, and will be good for America and the world.Trump is not a good man.Photo of Richard Branson by Mike Coppola via Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival.

"October 25, 2017","You might never suspect that up here in beautiful Washington State, we have one of the largest numbers of white supremacist groups in America. After all, it s gorgeous and relatively quiet, and this is a  blue  state, right? But under all of our fall colors, our lakes, our bike lanes, and our farmer s markets is the same hate you see in the Deep South or the rural Midwest or really anywhere in the United States.In fact, here in the northwest part of the Northwest, there are a surprising number of  Alt-Right  adherents. But considering how rural much of the area between Seattle and Canada is, nobody should be surprised at how many Trump supporters there are. And that seems to have been the catalyst for many people in my neck of the woods who at one time were relatively self-policing: Permission from the president to be bigots. If you listen to Donald Trump when the conversation moves to white nationalism, the subtext is almost that bigotry makes you more American, and we have got some flag wavers in these parts.So last month when my local paper covered a local murder that was, at least peripherally, connected to the Alt-Right, it really wasn t shocking to me. My (now-adult) son and I have attended any number of rallies up and down the freeway corridor we live on, and there is a strong presence of Richard Spencer wannabes and Milo Yiannopoulos sycophants at every single one. But over the fold was a face I knew: Lane Davis, a 33-year-old guy who lived a few doors down from my mom s old house. I saw him in stores and on the street. I bummed him a smoke outside the Safeway more than once.I touched that guy s hand.Image via FacebookHe killed his dad out on Samish Island, an island that s only actually an island because of a river that crosses the farmland you have have to drive through to get out there. You don t think about white supremacists on your way to Samish Island. I didn t anyway. I thought about my niece s wedding and my grandpa s funeral, both held at the Samish Island Community Center. I think about the herons and red-tailed hawks that hang out in those fields. I think about my mom sometimes. She s a Trump supporter and a bigot, but she wouldn t stab anyone like Lane Davis did.Davis worked for Milo for a little while, and he went by the online name  Seattle4Truth,  under which he posted to Reddit, his YouTube channel, and later, a super-mega-extremely-far-right website,  The Ralph Retort  (which I just won t link, so get to googling if that s your thing). And really, the link at the beginning of the last paragraph has a pretty in-depth profile of his various exploits, after The Daily Beast got their hands on the 911 call his mother made that fateful day.But it s incomplete. This is a small place, and it s personal. The judge who signed off on Davis  probable cause affidavit was the same man who gave me custody of my son. My friends are friends with Lane Davis  friends. I guarantee without texting her to ask her that the saleswoman who used to sell furniture for me knew Lane Davis personally and had possibly been to his house. When I tell you about the little place I live in, and how I casually handed out smokes to an eventual murderer, and the geography and wildlife near where that murderer lived, what I want you to do is go back to the words in bold letters a few paragraphs ago.Before Donald Trump, the white nationalists, racists, skinheads, Klan members, and just generally hateful people around here might have said something racist in public once. Maybe they had  No Trespassing  signs all over their deep-woods properties 20 miles up the Skagit River. Maybe they sported  III%  or  Prius Repellent  stickers on their giant trucks with the smokestacks tuned to blast creosote every time they leave a stoplight.Now they kill their dad because he called them a Nazi and tried to kick them out of the house when he got sick of their bullshit.Heck, Lane Davis isn t even the first murderer I ve ever known. I used to play D&D when I was a kid with a dude who killed another guy after a party back in the early 90 s. But that guy, by the time we were teens, we knew he was going to end up in prison. He was disturbed. He was morbid. He was violent.Lane Davis was just a racist until Donald Trump came along.Featured image via screen capture"," Alt-Right Trump Lover Loses His Sh*t, Kills His Own Dad For Calling Him A Nazi"
"October 26, 2016","Democrats appear to be completely fed up with Donald Trump s bizarre conspiracy theory where he alleges   without evidence   that the presidential election will be  rigged.  Trump has also called on his supporters to show up in minority-heavy voting precincts in a move that many believe is an attempt to suppress the vote, to  rig  things in his favor.Now Democrats are suing the Republicans.The Democratic National Committee is suing the Republican National Committee for aiding GOP nominee Donald Trump as he argues that the presidential election is  rigged,  claiming that Trump s argument is designed to suppress the vote in minority communities.The suit, filed Wednesday in US District Court in New Jersey, argues that the RNC has not sufficiently rebuked Trump for the line of attack, which he has used as a rallying cry and is assumed to be a way to explain away a potential loss on Election Day.The Democrats argue in the filing that  Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be  rigged  based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in  certain areas  or  certain sections  of key states. Republicans are still bound under a consent decree due to a previous court case, which limits their ability to officially send people to polling stations to intimidate voters. At the same time, outside fringe right wing armed militia groups like  The Oath Keepers  have recently sent out calls to patrol voting booths on Trump s behalf.Knowing how vital the votes of Latinos, blacks, and others are to Democratic hopes   especially with President Obama off the ballot   Republicans appear to be highly invested in any and all schemes focused on cutting down the number of voters. If they can suppress minority turnout, which has always been anti-Republican but could now form the foundation of a landslide, Republicans think they could pull out a (tainted) victory.Featured image via Flickr", Democrats SUE Republicans Over Plot To Rig Election

Well, Donald and Melania Trump can t do that because The Donald isn t allowed to set foot there anymore.Trump proposed to Melania at the Met Gala in 2004 where he presented her with a $3 million dollar ring he got for half price. The annual $50,000 per ticket event has been a favorite for the Trumps, who have frequently attended since their engagement. On Wednesday, the woman who has hosted the event since 1999, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, announced that Trump is no longer welcome to attend.The announcement happened on The Late Late James Show with James Corden during the  Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts  segment. Wintour was presented with the option of eating pickled pigs  feet or answering one of Cordon s questions, and she chose the latter. Celebrities from all walks of life are desperate to get a ticket, , Corden said.  Everyone from Beyonce to George Clooney attends, so my question is who would you never invite back to the Met Gala?

"October 27, 2016","A new report indicates that Vice President Joe Biden s long tenure in Washington, D.C. may not be over just yet if Hillary Clinton has anything to do with it. According to Politico, the Clinton brain trust is considering offering Biden one of the most important roles in her administration if she wins the election. Joe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary Clinton s transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO.This would be the first major Cabinet candidate to go public for a campaign that s insisted its focus remains on winning the election, and perhaps the most central choice for a potential president who was a secretary of state herself. The report indicates that a formal offer of the position has not been discussed yet between Biden and Clinton.Biden has years of experience with foreign policy, including time leading the Foreign Relations Committee when he was a U.S. Senator from Delaware, and he has been one of President Obama s closest advisors on the topic while serving as Vice President.Biden considered running for President this year, and some polls indicated he would have been a strong challenger to Clinton. After the death of his son Beau, he decided against the campaign and has endorsed Clinton. His speech in favor of Clinton at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia was one of the highlights of the event.He has been holding campaign events on her behalf and is among the all-star team of surrogates including the President, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Senator Bernie Sanders that are promoting Clinton s campaign.Biden has also dedicated himself to leading the so-called  moon shot  project to cure cancer, a position that President Obama announced for him during his final State of the Union address.Featured image via Flickr", Report: Hillary Wants Joe Biden For HUGE Role In White House
"October 27, 2017","Special Counsel Robert Mueller appears to have turned something up in his investigation into the Trump-Russia scandal. The first official charges have been filed according to CNN, and someone may well be taken into custody in just a few days. While the House and Senate seem to be throwing in the towel on their investigations, and Republicans including Trump himself are ramping up their calls for investigations into Hillary and Uranium One, Mueller is still doing his job.CNN has an exclusive story on this. The charges are currently sealed by order of a federal judge, and Mueller s office would not comment. However, they say: Plans were prepared Friday for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as Monday, the sources said. It is unclear what the charges are. Mueller was appointed special counsel shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. The original investigation was into whether Trump obstructed justice in firing Comey, but lately, he and his team have been interviewing everyone from Paul Manafort to Michael Flynn   both of whom have known ties to Russia and pro-Russia groups.Mueller s office has also been looking into a meeting between Don Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and a Russian attorney who claimed to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Don Jr. even said he  loved it  when he said he d take the meeting. He promptly lied about it, saying it was about adoptions, and then released emails proving he lied.Since it s not clear what the charges are or who they re against, there are all sorts of possibilities. The dominoes clearly are starting to fall, and Trump s increasingly loud focus on Hillary and Democrats shows that he s running ever more frightened.Featured image via media library", BREAKING: The First Charges Have Been Filed In Mueller’s Russia Investigation
"October 28, 2016","Donald Trump has repeatedly accused Democrats of rigging the election against him, but it turns out his own supporters are doing everything they can to rig it in his favor.And that includes voting twice, something Republicans continually claim that Democratic voters always get away with doing.The Des Moines Register reports,Terri Lynn Rote, 55, was booked into the Polk County Jail about 3:40 p.m. Thursday on a first-degree election misconduct charge, which is a Class D felony.Rote, a registered Republican, reportedly cast an early voting ballot at the Polk County Election Office, 120 Second Ave., and another ballot at a county satellite voting location in Des Moines, according to a Des Moines police report.So just to recap, Rote literally committed voter fraud in a desperate attempt to get Trump and the Republican Party an extra vote in this election.That s the precise definition of election rigging, but you won t hear Trump say anything about this because he thinks that Democrats are the ones committing voter fraud, which is why he has called for his supporters to intimidate minority voters at polling places.But this incident is far from the only time during this election that a Republican has been caught trying to rig the election.A Wisconsin city clerk was recently busted for trying to deny an extra polling place near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she argued in an email that students lean Democratic. I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,  Kris Teske wrote. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats. Imagine if a Democratic clerk denied letting a church be a polling place on the premise that most religious people are Republicans. The outrage and whining would last for days.And a right-wing group is literally creating fake badges so they can infiltrate polling places in order to intimidate voters on Election Day. Keep in mind that Republicans often accuse Democratic voters of using fake IDs to vote multiple times, but here s a right-wing group making fake IDs so they can use voter suppression tactics to swing the vote in favor of Trump.Thus far, it appears that only Donald Trump s supporters are trying to rig the election, not Democrats as he so often claims. And just think, there are still ten days left until Election Day. Still plenty of time for even more hypocritical Trump supporters to be caught trying to rig the election for the small-handed man who whines about how unfair our democratic system is.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images"," BUSTED: Trump Supporter Tries To Rig Election For The GOP, Gets ARRESTED"

Oh is that today?  Clinton said, linking Silver s tweet.The article Silver links notes that the letter Comey sent to Congress telling them the FBI had learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation  into Clinton s private email server,  upended the news cycle and soon halved Clinton s lead in the polls, imperiling her position in the Electoral College. Republicans and the majority of the media shoved the letter in the American people s faces seemingly non-stop, sticking us with the useless egomaniacal danger to our country who, unlike his predecessor, is embroiled in a legitimate scandal that actually threatens the future of our nation, that we know and hate today.It s good to see that Clinton was able to keep her sense of humor through all of this.

While Trump is a bit beyond the age of schoolyard scuffles (don t tell him that), he does like to challenge people who are much smarter than him to intellectual  scuffles.  One such smart person is retired Col. Jeff McCausland, who is a military expert   one Trump thinks he can teach  a couple things.  McCausland says, bring it on. Trump won t.McCausland is a visiting professor of international security studies at Dickinson University. He s the former dean of the Army War College. He s also a retired army colonel, so, yes, he knows a thing or two about military strategy. He says Trump doesn t  know a damn thing  about it.Trump, when asked about it by George Stephanopoulos, couldn t leave well enough alone. Instead, Trump said about McCausland,  You can tell your military expert that I ll sit down and I ll teach him a couple of things. McCausland, on Dickenson University s website, had a response for Trump: I can t wait to sit down with Mr. Trump and hear what he has to teach me about military strategy. I m happy to compare my record of over 45 years working in national security affairs with his any time. First, let s review Donald Trump s record on military strategy. He never served in the military and never served the government. During the primary campaign, Mr. Trump also made it very clear that he had no understanding of the nuclear triad or nuclear strategy. This is perhaps the most important thing any potential commander-in-chief needs to understand. He goes on to talk about specifics and how Trump is literally wrong about everything, but especially his assertion that Mosul is a  disaster. The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2016McCausland wrote: When it comes to the question of the Mosul offensive, Mr. Trump doesn t understand that 99.9 percent of the troops involved are Iraqi. War remains politics by other means, as Clausewitz once said. The Iraqi government has had a political imperative to publicly state that they would liberate Mosul since it was occupied by ISIS over two years ago. It is the second largest city in the country, and consequently Prime Minister Abadi has had a political imperative to reassure the Iraqi people that this was a goal. Iraq is a sovereign state, which has always been a goal of U.S. policy, so once cities like Ramadi or Fallujah in southwestern Iraq were liberated, everyone knew Mosul was next. He also criticized Trump s plan to take the oil from Iraq, saying that it would take a mind boggling number of troops and would create a lot of casualties. He also says that the population of Iraq would never stand for it. Why would they. Plus, it s a war crime. Not that Trump cares about that.In the end, he simply says,  I reassert my statement to the New York Times: Mr. Trump doesn t know a damn thing about military strategy. The fact is, Trump has literally zero experience with military strategy. Like so many rich kids, he never served in Vietnam. In fact, the man who touts his stamina on the campaign trail was excused from the war for having bone spurs on the heels of his feet. Trump is dangerous, and as so many have said, he should be allowed within miles of the nuclear codes.Featured image via Dickinson.edu. ", Military Expert Vows To Take Trump Up On His Challenge
"October 29, 2017","There s a lot of talk that, if Mueller indicts friends and associates of Trump over the Russia scandal, Trump will just pardon them and nobody will get punished, least of all Trump. There are two problems with that: First, to accept a pardon is to admit guilt, so he d be throwing them under the bus. But secondly, and perhaps more importantly, any pardons he issues could land him in hot water just that much sooner. According to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), his pardoning power is not exactly absolute.Schiff told ABC News: I don t think the president s power is all that absolute, as people have been suggesting.The president cannot pardon people if it s an effort to obstruct justice, if it s an effort to prevent Bob Mueller and others from learning about the President s own conduct. So, there are limitations. This whole thing really took off when Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate whether Trump obstructed justice when he fired James Comey. It s true that the Constitution does give the president broad power to issue pardons for  offenses against the United States.  However, we currently don t have any precedent for a president pardoning people tied to his own campaign, and rumors have been circulating that Trump wants to test his pardoning powers to see just how far they actually go.That could be part of why the Tweeter-In-Chief was panicking so badly on Twitter that he screamed,  DO SOMETHING!  in a rant about Hillary Clinton and Uranium One. He might be aware that not only is Mueller getting closer to something that implicates him, which we just can t have, but also that he can t pardon anyone Mueller indicts (or perhaps has been strongly warned away from trying).A pardon would require an admission of guilt, but it would also prevent people from flipping on Trump and singing out the truth in exchange for lesser charges or a lesser sentence. Depending on who s indicted, and what they do, the man who would be king in the White House will find it far more difficult to keep claiming that Russia is just a distraction and there s nothing to it.And so will all his lackeys.Too bad.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images", Attempts By Trump To Pardon Anyone Indicted By Mueller Could Backfire On Him In A BIG Way
"October 3, 2016","Ivanka Trump has been sort of the female face of her father s campaign, but despite being a woman, she really doesn t get it. That s quite evident in her new video touting her father s childcare plan, which she kicks off with following gender stereotyping words: The most important job any woman can have is being a mother. That is the height of irony, considering the fact that this video is directed towards working mothers. Working mothers value their jobs and their children, and many resent being shunted into sexist gender roles like this. Such a dismissive attitude toward women, both mothers and non-mothers, will do nothing to warm them up to Trump at all.But wait! There s more. Ivanka goes on to say: Donald Trump understands the needs of the modern workforce. Har de har har. Don t make us laugh too hard, it hurts. Ivanka s father once said that pregnancy is an inconvenience for business, and told a woman she was disgusting for needing to pump her breasts. He s a serial cheater, a serial sexual harasser, and a serial body-shamer.The AP published a story earlier today that exposes Trump s harassment of women on the set of  The Apprentice.  According to that story, he rated women contestants on the size of their breasts, and openly talked about which ones he d like to sleep with. He also wanted them to bare more cleavage and wear shorter skirts, and asked one woman to twirl for him so he could ogle her figure.As a woman who, at a previous job, was repeatedly asked to twirl around so a manager could ogle my figure before he d even answer a question I had, these revelations make me positively ill.Trump even compared a camerawoman s looks to the beauty of Ivanka on the set of  The Apprentice. Ivanka hasn t had a very good role model for a father, let alone for anything to do with feminism and women s rights. Trump always saw his parental duties as limited to providing funds for his children. He never actually parented, and he s said both of the following to boot: I mean, I won t do anything to take care of them. I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. It s not like I m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park. Marla used to say,  I can t believe you re not walking Tiffany down the street,  you know in a carriage. Right, I m gonna be walking down Fifth Avenue with a baby in a carriage. It just didn t work. And: There s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife and you know there s a lot of husbands that listen to that  I m really like a great father but certain things you do and certain things you don t. It s just not for me. This is understanding the needs of working mothers, women, and the modern workforce? Not hardly.Ivanka is in awe of her father, it seems, and carries a ton of internalized misogyny because of him and because of society. She s ill-equipped to reach out to women on this level on behalf of her father, because that takes a lot more than simply being a female face.Watch the entire ad below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video", Ivanka Just Fell Flat On Her Face Trying To Convince Women Fall In Line Behind Her Dad (VIDEO)
"October 3, 2017","A text message which was sent in January to U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, a staunch  pro-life  Republican representing Pennsylvania s 18th District, is now being revealed. In the text, a woman with whom Murphy was in a relationship outside of his marriage, took him to task for an anti-abortion statement posted on Facebook from his office s public account, the Pittsburg Post-Gazette reports. And you have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,  wrote Shannon Edwards, a forensic psychologist in Pittsburgh with whom the congressman admitted just last month to having an extramarital relationship. Mrs. Edwards is now going through a divorce following the affair.Murphy publicly admitted to the affair last month. Last year I became involved in an affair with a personal friend. This is nobody s fault but my own, and I offer no excuses. To the extent that there should be any blame in this matter, it falls solely upon me,  he said in a statement at the time.The Gazette notes that a text, which the paper obtained, from Murphy s cell phone number that same day responded to say,  I get what you say about my March for life messages. I ve never written them. Staff does them. I read them and winced,  he continued.  I told staff don t write any more. I will. So, he never believed the anti-choice messages he touted.The Gazette reports:The congressman has been lauded by the Family Research Council, for his stance on abortion, as well as for family values, generally. He also has been endorsed by LifePAC, which opposes abortion rights, and is a member of the House Pro-Life Caucus, an affiliation that is often cited by his office.In addition to Murphy s other problems, a six-page memo to the Pennsylvania Republican, presumably written by his chief of staff, Susan Mosychuk, described a hostile workplace in which Murphy repeatedly denigrated employees, threatened them and created a state of  terror. Apparently, being a  pro-life  Republican means not respecting life while secretly opting to be pro-choice for them. Murphy has voted against funding for Planned Parenthood and voted against federal funding for research that utilizes human embryonic stem cells.

"October 30, 2016","Chicago doesn t tend to be one of the cities one thinks of when one thinks of the religious right. Unfortunately, they do exist here, and some of them decided to do something unspeakably disgusting and cruel for Halloween. Calling themselves  Christians,  which they aren t, they put together a haunted house with 10 rooms   one of which showed the mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando.Pulse was a club frequented by the LGBTQ community, and there are many on the religious right who seem to think that the victims of that horror simply got what was coming to them. The so-called  Christians  who put this atrocity together called it,  THE ROOM: A JOURNEY TO HELL. What s the implication there? It s pretty clear. In each of the 10 rooms were scenes in which people supposedly made choices that would send them to hell. The inclusion of the Pulse shooting indicates that the group who put this together believes that the clubgoers who were brutally murdered that night went to hell due to their  choice  of living the  homosexual lifestyle. Ergo, getting murdered was what they deserved for willfully committing that sin.The haunted house was to happen at Fernwood Elementary School, which is part of Chicago Public Schools. An elementary school is not an appropriate venue for anything like this, even though children under 13 were supposedly prohibited from going through it. CPS very wisely decided not to allow the haunted house at all, according to the Windy City Times, and a spokesperson for CPS said: The event organizers mischaracterized the true content of the event, and we did not approve any association with the activities the organizers have now advertised. The event will not be held on CPS property. Because of course they did.The event organizers posted an ad on Facebook asking for volunteers for the event, and the event has now been banned there, too, as well it should be.

Immediately after the news of the indictment hit, Hannity was ready with his defense of Trump which means he s blaming Hillary:Not that there wasn t Russian collusion with a 2016 presidential candidate. It s just that her name was not Trump. We now have real evidence that the FBI uncovered a Russian plot dating back to 2009 that involved bribery, extortion, blackmail, money laundering and racketeering. It all came a year before Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration approved the corrupt Uranium One deal. We have evidence of another Russia scandal, also involving a 2016 candidate not named Trump. We now know that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid over $9 million to help fund the discredited, Russia-linked dossier crafted to ruin then-candidate Donald Trump. This was nothing short of a collaborative effort with the Russians to manipulate the outcome of the last presidential election.Not surprisingly, Trump s statements are mirroring Hannity:Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.

"October 31, 2016","Trump has repeatedly said that all the ways he avoided paying taxes was legal, and has even shown his ignorance about how our government works to paint Hillary as incompetent because she didn t single-handedly change these laws during her time in the Senate. However, while he was busy avoiding taxes in the 1990s, his own lawyers warned him against doing, well, exactly what he did.A new report in The New York Times explains that, order to avoid total financial ruin, Trump didn t report hundreds of millions that was technically income. He didn t just not report it, though   the IRS would have seen through that immediately. Instead, his first step to avoiding taxes was successfully pushing his various bondholders to cancel the hundreds of millions he owed them.To the IRS, a dollar of canceled debt is a dollar of taxable income. That could have crippled the self-proclaimed master of debt and taxes about as badly as all that debt he couldn t pay. So what did he do? He used what s called a  stock-for-debt  swap maneuver.Except Congress banned that practice for corporations in 1993. However, Trump s real estate holdings in Atlantic City the ones that were all in trouble weren t corporations. They were partnerships. So he thought he could still swap what s called  partnership equity  for his debt.Apparently, this works even if the stocks, or, in Trump s case, the equities, are worth considerably less than the canceled debt. The Times says that this is as close as anyone can get to making taxes just magically disappear.But legally, this is fraught with its own problems and Trump s own lawyers actually warned him against doing it. He asked his tax attorneys for formal opinion letters on his plan, which all came back saying: The letters bluntly warned that there was no statute, regulation or judicial opinion that explicitly permitted Mr. Trump s tax gambit.  Due to the lack of definitive judicial or administrative authority,  his lawyers wrote,  substantial uncertainties exist with respect to many of the tax consequences of the plan.' In other words, they felt that his scheme wouldn t stand up to IRS scrutiny. We don t know if the IRS went after him for this because nobody has the whole story. However, from what we do have, tax expert and former chief tax council for the House Ways and Means Committee, John L. Buckley, was able to say: He s getting something for absolutely nothing. Buckley also said: He deducted somebody else s losses. He is double dipping big time. Buckley means that the only people who should have been able to deduct those losses were the bondholders who canceled his debts, and thus, lost out on their investments.This could be one of the bombshells he s hiding in his tax returns. Since all of this involved partnerships, profits could go straight to his personal returns, as could other items. With Trump refusing to release those, though, we don t know just how badly he stretched the law, if not broke it altogether.This scheme quite possibly laid the groundwork for his massive $916 million loss in 1995, which may have allowed him to avoid paying taxes again for 20 years. In other words, not only has he possibly sailed along while Americans who earn an honest day s pay for an honest day s work dutifully paid their taxes, but he very likely broke the law in all his machinations here in a way that the regular Americans he claims to understand would never get away with (hell, we wouldn t even know where to start, most likely).Oddly enough, using partnership equity swaps to avoid taxes was banned by Congress in 2004. Among the Senators who voted to close that loophole was Hillary Clinton.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images"," Was Trump’s Tax Evasion Perfectly Legal, As He Claims?

Polls have begun emerging showing Trump down 5-6 percent, and by as much in some polls as 10 percent against Clinton.And it might even be worse than it appears. Internal polls   which have a tendency to show the candidate paying for them in a better position than public polls   are reportedly showing a massive collapse for Trump.Mr. Trump has already slipped perceptibly in public polls, trailing widely this week in Pennsylvania and by smaller margins in Florida and North Carolina   three states he cannot afford to lose. But private polling by both parties shows an even more precipitous drop, especially among independent voters, moderate Republicans and women, according to a dozen strategists from both parties who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data was confidential.Liesl Hickey, a Republican strategist involved in several House races in swing states, said she was dismayed by a sudden exodus of independent voters in more diverse parts of the country. They are really starting to pull away from Trump,  said Ms. Hickey, describing his soaring unpopularity with independents as entering  uncharted territory. These voters are not responding well to Trump s unhinged attacks on former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who has become a symbol of the nominee s bias against women and Latinos. They also don t like the way he is engaging in gutter politics, by promising to bring up President Bill Clinton s marital infidelity.Yet Trump seems undeterred by the negative reception he s received for these proposals. Surrounded by a phalanx of  yes  men and women, Trump seems to believe that these lines of attack will work for him and expand his support beyond the uneducated older white males that are the bulk of his supporter.That probably isn t a good bet.Featured image via Flickr"," BREAKING: Secret GOP Polls Show Trump In TOTAL Collapse, Congressional Candidates Fear Wipeout"
"October 5, 2017","On Sunday, August 13th, Salt Lake City Police seemed to have a routine bicycle stop under control. Patrick Harmon, a 50-year-old black man who was pulled over on his bike for riding without a working taillight at night, was standing on the side of the road with officers complying with their requests. Officer Clinton Fox asked Harmon if he knew about his warrants, which Harmon answered in the affirmative. Harmon was in tears throughout the encounter.Then, as Harmon finished removing his backpack as Officer Fox requested, he decided he was too scared of jail to stay. He got loose of the straps of his pack and ran.Did Clinton Fox, fellow human being, decide to run after Patrick Harmon? Not on your life. Or more precisely, not on Patrick s. One assumes that Fox, being a police officer, was in far superior shape to the middle-aged man smoking a cigarette only moments before, but rather than expend the energy it would ve required to run his suspect down on foot   like police do every damn day   he instead chose to draw his service weapon and fire three shots into Harmon s back as he ran. His finger was already pulling the trigger the first time by the moment he shouted  I m gonna fuckin  shoot you! Harmon s sobbing can be heard as he lies prone on the sidewalk. The light of another officer s taser, which had been at the ready well before Officer Fox shot Harmon in the back, circles around Patrick s heaving body. I got  im,  says Officer Fox.The DA would later say that the shooting was  legally justified,  before the body camera footage you re about to see was released. The police report would alternately first say that Harmon was on foot, then on a bike. It would say that he had a gun, then it was changed to a knife. His rap sheet was public long before the footage.Patrick s sister Antoinette drove 1,300 miles to join the rally held by Black Lives Matter organizer Lex Scott to demand the release of the body cam video. Ms. Scott has held many such rallies. This is about accountability and transparency. This is about Patrick Harmon s family deserving to see that footage. If [SLCPD] did nothing wrong, wouldn t they have released the footage by now? Now the footage has been released, and it is damning.Will Officer Fox face consequences for the apparent murder of Patrick Harmon? The shooting, by any metric, is certainly not justified. Will the DA withdraw their statements? Will the SLCPD form a tight ring around their comrade, squeezing out truth and transparency?Let s hope this incident breaks the pattern and there is accountability.THE FOLLOWING FOOTAGE IS GRAPHIC AND SHOWS THE SHOOTING OF PATRICK HARMONFeatured image via George Frey/Getty Images"," SLC Cops Murder Crying Suspect, Shoot Him In The Back AND Taser Him Without Even Pursuing"
"October 6, 2016","Florida s Republican governor Rick Scott is not allowing the impending pressure of Hurricane Matthew to interrupt his partisan push on behalf of Donald Trump in his state. The storm is expected to disrupt day-to-day operations in the state at multiple levels, with multiple state and county agencies, as well as hundreds of private businesses, shutting down to ride out the weather event.The storm is sure to affect the impending deadline for voter registration on October 11. But when Democrats asked Governor Scott to extend the deadline as the population digs out from the storm, he decided to refuse.Republican Florida Governor Rick Scott on Thursday evening said the state will not extend an October 11 voter registration deadline. I m not going to extend it,  Scott said at a news conference on the storm.  Everybody has had plenty of time to register. I don t intend to make any changes. Scott is not a disinterested third party by any stretch. In addition to being a fellow Republican, Scott currently serves as the national chairman of a super PAC helping the Trump campaign, Rebuilding America Now.The governor s behavior is part of a long-standing election year pattern amongst many Republican officials, where they do whatever is in their power   often as Secretary of State or Governor   to ensure that as few Democrats as possible are eligibile to vote. In the south, particularly, a lot of these actions are targeted at counties with large black populations.The government of North Carolina was recently rebuked for designing a voter ID system that was designed from the ground-up to exclude voters from areas with black populations that were more likely to vote Democratic.Hurricane Matthew is expected to hit somewhere along the northern part of Palm Beach county and above, along Florida s east coast. That is an area of the state that leans more Democratic, and as such the storm path would impact that demographic.And it becomes very clear why the governor made the decision he has.Featured image via Flickr", Florida Governor Uses Hurricane Matthew As Excuse To Try And Help Trump Win
"October 6, 2017","Proving that Donald Trump and his administration is the most clueless, out of touch team to  lead  America, Vice President Mike Pence just had a really awkward run-in with one of the survivors of Hurricane Maria.As Puerto Rico is absolutely ravaged from the recent hurricane, Trump has decided to turn his back on U.S. citizens and instead focus on attacking NFL players and the media. Meanwhile, his team is trying to do damage control to pick up the slack, and sent Pence to Puerto Rico to assure survivors that everything would be okay. Unfortunately, that plan backfired tremendously.Everlinda Burgos, a survivor of Hurricane Maria from central Puerto Rico, ruined Pence s photo op by holding the Trump administration accountable and pointing out that they weren t doing nearly enough. As cameras rolled, Burgos put Pence on the spot and said: Don t go to San Juan. Go inside the country, like where I live. I live in Naranjito, that s inside the country. Right now, inside the country is where you re going to see the disaster. Where you can t   there s towns you can t go in. Burgos also nailed Pence s boss by bringing up Trump s disgusting, insensitive comment that Puerto Rico officials should be  very proud  that only sixteen people had died. Burgos said: You don t know the people that has died there because they don t know, they don t have no communication. You know? So, right now they say 18 people died. No, no, no. We have more people died. But we don t have no communication. So, go in. And things got even worse for Pence. Off-camera, a woman jumped in to correct Burgos and said the most current death toll stated thirty-four. Burgos added: Thirty-four today. Right now, that s what they say outside. Pence didn t know what the hell to say, so he muttered  Good to talk.  But Burgos wasn t done with him. She said: I would like you to go to the center. Because that s where the disaster is. Pence made a half-ass agreement and then asked,  You ll be fine, your son, your family, and then you ll be able to go home, right?  Clearly, he was still clueless of how bad the situation was, and likely had no intention of going through with his promise.You can watch his awkward exchange with Burgos below:The people of Puerto Rico deserve better.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images", WATCH: Mike Pence’s Photo Op With Puerto Rico Survivors Just Went TERRIBLY Wrong (VIDEO)
"October 7, 2016","Earlier today, an audio recording surfaced of Donald Trump talking about working really hard to fuck a married woman eight months after he married Melania. But this is about more than just a leaked extramarital affair; he actually tried to assault this woman and he bragged that he just starts kissing beautiful women, which is likewise sexual assault.His inner circle and surrogates don t know what to do with this.Mike Pence actually dodged his press pool and then disappeared when they asked him about it. Politico s Matthew Nussbaum got that on video and posted it to Twitter earlier today:My attempt to get Pence to respond to the Trump tape. He ignored the question. pic.twitter.com/jgv5rUJZIb  Matthew Nussbaum (@MatthewNussbaum) October 7, 2016Perhaps, when he s had a chance to calm down, he ll tell the press that Trump never said those things he said. He s good at that. Maybe he ll even say the audio was doctored, the Washington Post s David Farenthold obviously fabricated it, whatever. It ll be the only way that Mr. Mike Family Values Pence can deal with this without cracking up.One of Pence s campaign staffers said that his hasty departure with no comment to his press pool had nothing to do with this news. We call bullshit on that.Ben Carson, another staunch defender of  family values,  and who s one of Trump s surrogates now for whatever reason, said through his spokesman that this is no big deal, because everyone cheats on their spouse: You know, these things happen. I m sure somebody could find a video of Bill Clinton talking like this   are we gonna say Bill Clinton was the same person as president that he is today? Obviously not.People commit adultery. It happens. Ministers. Heads of state. Everyday people. People are human, they do human things. It s nothing unusual that somebody committed adultery on their spouse. Women do it. Men do it. Should we be shocked by it? No. The difference is that Republicans tried to argue, back in the day, that Bill Clinton s sexual escapades made him unfit to be President. They felt, at the time, that presidents should be held to a higher standard. Yet here s Ben Carson, a staunch evangelical and Republican, basically saying,  Eh. Everyone does it. So what? Others are not so quick to defend him, though. Paul Ryan, who had finally managed to swallow his bile enough to appear with Trump, disinvited him to the Wisconsin event tomorrow and will appear alone.He said: I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who has spent an awful lot of time defending Trump from various attacks since the July convention, blasted him: No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever. And one of his own campaign advisers said: This should have never happened. I wish it had never happened. I think I know that men talk this way sometimes, but it s nothing I would ever want to hear or condone or approve of. My reaction is   it s appalling. It s just flat out appalling. The adviser said,  Another day in Trump world I hate it. Trump s campaign did issue an apology, but it was lukewarm and backhanded and tried to deflect some of the backlash by saying Bill Clinton was probably worse.And so it goes. If Bill Clinton was unfit to serve because of his extramarital affairs, then what s Trump for sexually assaulting women and openly bragging about it? The GOP will never coalesce around a response for this.Featured image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images", Trump’s Revolting ‘Hot Mic’ Moment Has Just Blown His Campaign And The GOP To Bits (VIDEO)
"October 7, 2017","If Republicans have their way, rape victims will continue to be terrorized by their rapists.The victim was only 12 years old when Christopher Mirasolo raped her and impregnated her. Despite also threatening her life, Mirasolo only spent six months in prison, only to spend four more years in prison for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl.That being said, Mirasolo should NOT be allowed anywhere near a child and should still be rotting in prison.But a Michigan judge has decided that Mirasolo should have joint custody of the child his victim gave birth to eight years ago.According to The Detroit News, county officials surveyed the victim s use of food stamps, aid she relies on to take care of her eight-year-old son.For some reason, the county connected her to Mirasolo and a DNA test was taken. It appears the county was searching for a reason to kick her and her son off the food stamp program so they did all of this without her consent.Well, despite the fact that Mirasolo is the victim s rapist, Sanilac County Circuit Judge Gregory S. Ross gave him joint custody of child, ordered the victim to move back to Michigan, and gave her address to Mirasolo.In other words, Judge Ross just put a woman s life in danger and endangered a child.And by giving Mirasolo joint custody, he is allowing a rapist to continue terrorizing his victim. I think this is all crazy,  the victim told The Detroit News.  They never explained anything to me. I was receiving about $260 a month in food stamps for me and my son and health insurance for him. I guess they were trying to see how to get some of the money back. Her attorney is also rightfully pissed off.This is insane,  attorney Rebecca Kiessling said.  Nothing has been right about this since it was originally investigated. He was never properly charged and should still be sitting behind bars somewhere, but the system is victimizing my client, who was a child herself when this all happened. And the same scenario could play out across the nation if Republicans have their way. House Republicans recently passed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks and you can be damn sure they will keep trying to ban abortion entirely, with zero exceptions for rape victims. That means rapists will be able to seek joint custody in order to make their victim s lives a living hell. Imagine having to interact with the person who raped you and having to hand your child over to them.It s a terrifying scenario that no rape victim should have to face. Conservatives are constantly telling us that rape victims should carry these pregnancies to term because the baby isn t to blame. But as long as rapists are able to pursue custody and terrorize their victims for the rest of their lives, women should never lose the right to choose. Because no one should be forced to live their life in terror and fear.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Conservative Dream Come True: Judge Grants Rapist Joint Custody Of Victim’s Child
"October 8, 2016","Hillary Clinton and most of her surrogates have stayed silent, apparently waiting to pounce on Donald Trump during the debate scheduled for Sunday night. The Vice President, though, couldn t hold his opinion. He took to Twitter and said exactly what most women are thinking about Donald Trump s disgusting remarks about  grabbing  women by the  pussy.  Joe Biden called it sexual assault.The words are demeaning. Such behavior is an abuse of power. It s not lewd. It s sexual assault.  Joe  Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 8, 2016Much of the media (and Republicans) is treating the tape, in which Trump is heard talking about groping women and kissing them, without permission, as just more words. It s Trump as usual, they say, only raw and on steroids. The problem with that, though, is that Trump is describing criminal acts. He s clearly in the habit of using his power and money to take anything he wants, and women to Trump are just things.Biden has long been an advocate of women s rights. He has been a driving force behind helping to end the backlog of unprocessed rape kits.Biden was also key in the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in the Senate and calls it  the proudest thing I ve ever done.  His goal is to change the culture in this country. When a woman is raped, when a woman is abused, the first thing other women ask is what did you do? Why were you there? What were you wearing?  Biden said.  Folks, all the opportunity and entrepreneurship in the world is good. But ultimately, starting in this country, we have to change the culture. And we re not going to change that culture until not a single woman who is abused ever asks herself:  What did I do? Source: Huffington PostTrump supporters, of course, are doing the only thing they know how.

"October 8, 2017","People like to pretend that Mike Pence is the grown-up in the room compared to Donald Trump s brash childishness from the White House. However, he proved that wrong on Sunday, when he left the Indiana Colts football game because a few of the players on the team opposing the Colts chose to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black and brown Americans. Taking a leaf out of Trump s playbook, Pence tweeted:I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.  Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem  Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017Just like Trump, Pence forgets the meaning of the First Amendment, and seems to think that his position gives him the right to try to bully owners, players, and ultimately the National Football League into following his orders. Further, it is worth noting that the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers, which is the former team of Colin Kaepernick, the man who started this protest before being blacklisted from the NFL for taking a stand against police brutality against people of color. Further, Pence and Trump admitted that they used the situation to divide the country and make some kind of point on the taxpayers  dime   because of course we paid for Pence to travel to that football game. For one thing, the press was kept in the van, in anticipation of Pence stirring the pot and then leaving:The media pool was kept in the vans ahead of the game instead of being led in with VPOTUS. https://t.co/NXIFZCp3fb  Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) October 8, 2017FLAG: Was Pence leaving Colts game a political stunt?

"October 9, 2017","Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker announced last month that he wouldn t be seeking reelection when his term expires at the end of next year, but now President Donald Trump and Corker have had a public falling out on Trump s beloved platform, Twitter.It all kicked off on Sunday morning when Trump posted a series of tweets claiming that he denied Corker s request for an endorsement. Todd Womack, Corker s chief of staff, refuted the claim later in the day, saying in a statement that the President called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times. Trump s Corker-directed fit of tweet-rage came just days after the Senator publicly criticized the President, a move that never sits well with Trump, leading him to try and seek revenge:Senator Bob Corker ""begged"" me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said ""NO"" and he dropped out (said he could not win without  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017..my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said ""NO THANKS.""

Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.  Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017Corker later decided enough was enough and opted to tell it like it is in a phone interview with The New York Times on Sunday night, claiming that Trump was treating the presidency like  a reality show,  making reckless threats against other countries that put the United States  on the path to World War III. He concerns me,  Mr. Corker said.  He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation,  he said. He was far from done.  I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it s a situation of trying to contain him,  the Senator said in the interview.When it came to the tweets, Corker simply confirmed what we already knew. I don t know why the president tweets out things that are not true,  he said.  You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.

The state s efforts follow complaints from Muslim and Sikh agencies that some residents have been asked to remove religious head coverings.The Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund brought the issue to Illinois  Secretary of State s office about a year ago after Sikh residents complained that they had been asked to take off their dastaars, the turbans Sikhs wear around their heads, for photos. We had been getting complaints from around the states from Sikh Americans who were being asked to remove or modify their turbans to get their photo ID,  the executive director Jasjit Singh told Fusion Friday.Muslims became the state s fastest growing and third-largest group in 2012, according to the Chicago Tribune. And while there is no readily available state data about the Sikh population, there are half a million Sikhs living in the United States.A spokesperson for Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White emphasized to Fusion that it has always been illegal to ask people to remove their head covering, and that the fliers serve as a reminder for government employees of how to respect religious diversity. No change has actually taken place to our procedures,  said Henry Haupt, Deputy Press Secretary for the Secretary of State s office.  What we re doing was always allowed the religious head coverings of this nature but what we want to ensure is that the public s aware of them because we were told that some individuals were unaware that they could have their photo taken for the drivers license wearing them.

I am here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday at a Justice Department news conference.Sessions was critical of the Obama program implemented through executive order in 2012 to give work authorization and government benefits, like Social Security to nearly a million illegal aliens.  MRCTV Watch: The brilliant Jessica Vaughan, from the Center for Immigration Studies, shared these important facts about DACA recipients in America, compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales, called the National UnDACAmented Research Project. There are important (self-acknowledged) caveats to the findings: The research is based on an online survey of just over 2,000 self-described DACA-eligible respondents and about 200 follow-up interviews. Gonzales believes that for a variety of reasons, the respondents are more educated and well-off than the DACA population as a whole.Nevertheless, the findings are interesting. Here is a sample:73 percent of DACA recipients he surveyed live in a low-income household (defined as qualifying for free lunch in high school); 22 percent have earned a degree from a four-year college or university; 21 percent have dropped out of high school; 20 percent have no education beyond high school and no plans to attend college; 59 percent obtained a new job with a DACA work permit, but only 45 percent increased their overall earnings; 36 percent have a parent who holds a bachelor s degree; and 51 percent were already employed before DACA. None of this is to suggest that these individuals should not be considered for an amnesty or legalization program, but to suggest that the arguments in favor of such a program are largely political rather than economic. Immigrants who are not highly educated and who are working in low-paying jobs are more likely to access welfare and other public assistance programs over the course of their lives.

"Sep 12, 2015","Is it a coincidence that more and more evidence keeps magically appearing in the case against Hillary and the misuse of her private email account? Is the timing with Joe Biden s (Obama s puppet) entry into the Presidential race and the release of more damning evidence against Hillary accidental or is the Chicago mob politician just getting warmed up It looks like Hillary might be beaten by Barack yet again The Denver-based company that stored Hillary Clinton s private email server said that the emails might still be recoverable, because there s no evidence that the server was properly wiped clean. Platte River has no knowledge of the server being wiped,  Platte River representative Andy Boian told The Washington Post.  All the information we have is that the server wasn t wiped. If the server was not wiped clean, and investigators can still get all of the information off it, then Clinton-World s attempts to stonewall the investigation could be rendered null and void.Clinton did, in fact, delete all of her emails earlier this year, but it is possible that she never managed to physically damage the server itself to the degree that all of the information on it would be lost forever. Thus, the server, which is now in the possession of the FBI and Department of Justice investigators, could still pull up some of the confidential emails that Clinton thought would never see the light of day.But Platte River s statement to The Post might also be an example of the company running interference for the Clintons.Boian, it should be noted, is representing Platte River Networks through his small, Colorado-based public relations firm Dovetail Solutions, which also employs top Clinton operative David Goodfriend, a major Washington cyber security lobbyist and friend of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Platte River Networks  vice president David DeCamillis also went to high school with Clinton s 2008 tech chief Nathaniel Pearlman, who supervised Clinton s server manager Bryan Pagliano.Pagliano has pleaded the Fifth to protect himself from having to give up any information about his work on Clinton s server.Via: Breitbart",NOT BREAKING…HILLARY LIKELY LIED: Does Obama’s Support For Biden Have Anything To Do With New Bombshell Discovery That Hillary’s E-mails “Might Still Be Recoverable”

That s the plan,  White House press secretary Josh Earnest said when asked if the President planned to veto the bill, saying it would  complicate diplomatic relations. Earnest defended the administration s stance against the bill saying it is not  an effective, forceful way for us to respond to terrorism.

"Sep 14, 2016","Who knew, that one of the wealthiest entertainers in America and the New Black Panthers biggest cheerleader, has a sister who is also a perpetual victim of racism? When she s not beating the shit out of her brother-in-law Jay-Z in an elevator, Solange Knowles is a professional victim of racism. Beyonc s crazier less talented sister recently attended a concert, as a fan not as a performer, and wouldn t you know it, racism reared it s ugly head. Apparently someone asked her to sit down and since she is black, it was a hostile act of racial aggression.If you have nothing better to do, and haven t already witnessed the circus that ensues when a celebrity husband cheats on his celebrity wife with another woman, forcing the sister to even the score in an elevator, you can watch it here:Back to the Solange and her racist manifesto, where she goes to great lengths to explain the racism she encounters in just about every aspect of her life, like the time she got pulled over or the other time she had to show her passport crossing an international border. She describes the perpetrators of racism as,  a product of their white supremacy and are exercising it on you without caution, care, or thought. The main point of this crazy thing was what happened to her at a recent concert. It s written from a weird 2nd person perspective, but this is what I was able to figure out:Solange took her 11-year-old son to a Kraftwerk concert. They arrived late, despite Solange s claim that she is a big fan. Right off the bat an elderly black usher had to tell her son to stop vaping. Solange claims her young son was not vaping, so therefore it was racism.It gets worse. Solange was standing up and dancing when someone behind her asked her to sit down. She refused to sit and eventually someone threw a slice of lime at her. Again: racism. She turned around to confront whoever threw the lime but nobody s white privilege would let them admit to it. For the third time, she experienced racism.Granted, this is a one-sided explanation of things. It s entirely possible that Solange was being rude and obnoxious and the people behind her gave her a gentile reminder to behave herself in public. Then again, maybe none of this stuff even happened.The crazy level rises significantly when Solange tries to put her harrowing experience in perspective by saying:You constantly see the media having a hard time contextualizing black women and men as victims every day, even when it means losing their own lives.Shit, can you believe she almost died in this racist lime attack?She then says that she isn t claiming this incident was racism, even though she said it many times, and chides the media for potentially reporting it that way, followed immediately by this:This is why many black people are uncomfortable being in predominately white spacesFrom there Solange rants about all of the racism in America and ends with the odd statement that she has  many white friends.

God forbid you address the war on law enforcement (that you started), because it s not nearly as important to you as shining a spotlight on supposed racial inequality is it? President Barack Obama issued a personal invitation via Twitter to a Muslim high school student who got in trouble last week in Texas for bringing a home made  briefcase clock  to school, touching off a terrorism scare.Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.  President Obama (@POTUS44) September 16, 2015Fourteen year-old Ahmed Mohamed was taken in handcuffs by police from MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas after he brought his invention to school the Monday after the fourteenth anniversary of the 9/11 Islamist terror attacks on the U.S. An alarm for the briefcase clock went off in class, prompting a teacher to observe the devise looked like a bomb. Police investigated and on Wednesday announced no charges would be filed. Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It s what makes America great.At Wednesday s press briefing held right after Obama tweeted his invitation to Mohamed, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest attacked the teachers at Mohamed s school for erring on the side of caution in an era of Islamist terror attacks and  troubled student  school massacres.Earnest also announced Obama was inviting Mohamed to the White House Astronomy Night on October 19. (Quotes assembled from transcribing and various sources.) I think the president like many of us was struck by the news reports of this particular incident. The fact is that America s best teachers in our schools, in our best schools at least, nurture the intellectual curiosity of all of our students. In this instance it is clear that at least some of Ahmed s teachers failed him. That s too bad (It s not) too late for all of us to use this as a teachable moment. This episode is a good illustration of how pernicious stereotypes can prevent even goodhearted people who have dedicated their lives to educating young people from doing the good work they set out to do. This is an instance where you have people who have otherwise dedicated their lives to teach our children who failed in that effort, potentially because of some things in their conscience and the power of stereotypes. The White House was pleased to extend an invitation to Ahmed to participate in Astronomy Night. We ll bring together NASA scientists, others to spend time with young people. It will be an opportunity to talk about science, the solar system. It should be a good event. We re hopeful he ll feel right at home.

"Sep 16, 2017","Hungary has slashed illegal immigration by over 99 per cent after rolling out a series of powerful border fences in response to the European migrant crisis, possibly providing a lesson as to the potential impact of constructing President Trump s much-discussed southern wall in the U.S.A razor-wire fence built along Hungary s southern border with Serbia and Croatia has helped to sharply reduce the number of migrants from the hundreds of thousands who last year moved up from the Balkans towards northern Europe, especially Germany.Hungary says it has registered 19,140 asylum applications in 2016 and more than 14,000 migrants have crossed its southern borders illegally.Speaking on the second anniversary of the government s move to seal Hungary s border with Serbia   which is also an external border for the European Union   Prime Minister Viktor Orb n s Chief Security Advisor Gy rgy Bakondi announced that the fences have caused illegal immigration to collapse from 391,000 in 2015, to 18,236 in 2016, to just 1,184 in 2017.In February 2017, Prime Minister Orb n took his war against George Soros public:Hungary s populist prime minister on Friday lashed out against billionaire financier George Soros, claiming he and groups backed by him want to secretly influence the country s politics.In his annual state of the nation speech, Viktor Orban said groups partly funded by Soros, who was born in Hungary, needed to be made transparent and identifiable. Large-bodied predators are swimming here in the waters. This is the trans-border empire of George Soros, with tons of money and international heavy artillery,  said Orban, who received a Soros-funded scholarship as Hungary was transitioning from communism to democracy in the late 1980s. It is causing trouble   that they are trying secretly and with foreign money to influence Hungarian politics,  Orban said.Breitbart:  The system of technical barriers is the key to the success of border security, and without it, it would be impossible to stop the mass arrival of immigrants , the security chief explained.Hungary had to respond rapidly to the migrant influx which burst upon Europe after Germany s Angela Merkel announced there was  no limit  on the number of asylum seekers her own country would accept, so its frontiers are defended by twin fences peppered with watchtowers and patrolled by thousands of newly recruited border guards rather than a solid wall   which would have taken longer to construct.Nevertheless, as it has been steadily reinforced illegal migration has slowed to a trickle   drawing the ire of open borders activists like billionaire financier George Soros and globalist officials at the European Union and the United Nations.In June 2017, Orb n told the Hungarian parliament that his country  will not give in to blackmail from Brussels and we reject the mandatory relocation quota.  Schulz shot back swiftly at Orb n in his speech on Tuesday.His comments came as the European Commission voted to launch infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary for not taking in refugees under a mandatory 2015 quota system advocated by Germany that aimed to relocate 160,000 refugees across the Continent.Hungary s badass Prime Minister Viktor Orb n has consistently stood up to leftist EU bullies who are demanding that all EU nations take their  fair share  of the mass influx of mostly Muslim refugees.

We ve always admired his courage to stand up to union thugs who have done everything in their power to shut down his opposition to the Leftist, Democrat supporting unions. Brian penned this awesome letter to the Detroit Free Press. We d like to share it with you here:As a blue-collar worker in a UAW-represented plant, I m seeing an enthusiasm for a Republican candidate that I have not seen in the 20 years that I have worked at Ford Motor Co. There s a lot of talk about who will win the labor vote this season. But we have to ask, just who does the term  labor  actually represent when it is used today?In the 21st Century, labor unions increasingly represent college educated workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2015 nearly half of all union members worked for the government. Public sector workers (those paid with your tax dollars) are almost five times more likely to belong to a union than private sector workers. And while unionized workers in Michigan can now refuse to pay union dues, even while working under the terms of a negotiated contract thanks to Right to Work, many feel intimidated and are afraid to exercise that right due to veiled threats from union bosses and some coworkers.The support that Donald Trump has from union families and blue collar workers may be surprising to some. Two polls cited in the Free Press recently showed that 30% of those who said there is a union member in their household plan to vote for Trump. But you have to look beyond measures of union-represented workers. Today, many blue-collar workers, including some represented by unions that have endorsed Hillary Clinton, are looking to Donald Trump s candidacy to return the power to them, and bring jobs back to America that left after bad trade deals, including NAFTA.In an online poll conducted for Bloomberg News, 55% of whites with no more than a high school degree, said they support Trump. In my plant, there are a lot of people who are saying  I m voting for Trump and I m not ashamed of it. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has supported NAFTA and the TPP in the past, while Donald Trump has promised to re-negotiate NAFTA and to oppose the TPP. Union members like that kind of talk, and that s why so many of them are breaking with their union bosses to support Donald Trump.Brian PannebeckerFORD Assembly Line Worker, MI","WOW!

He doesn t just like Putin, he wants to be like Putin,  Clinton said of Trump on MSNBC s Rachel Maddow show Thursday night.But as secretary of state, Clinton took pains to engage with the Kremlin. Just one week prior to sending out the invites, Hillary flew to Geneva and presented the Russian foreign minister with an actual  reset button  to symbolize a new beginning in U.S.-Russia relations.Beyond the Putin invite, many serious conflicts of interests arose from the sitting secretary of state s invite list.Judicial Watch explains further:The list includes dignitaries from Saudi Arabia, which gave $14.5 million to the Clinton Foundation; Kuwait, which gave between $5 and $10 million; Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar   all of which donated between $1 and $5 million over the years.

FOX News   Hidden in a remote area off a primitive dirt road lies a mysterious 70-acre compound in which more than 100 Muslims live in seclusion, following the teachings of its founder, a radical cleric with alleged ties to terrorism.It s neither a Taliban stronghold outside Jalalabad, nor an extremist madrassa on the outskirts of Karachi.It s a place called Islamberg, a closed and seemingly quiet community at the foot of the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York, about three hours north of Manhattan.It s also a compound shrouded in local rumors, mystery   and fear   sitting near the huge reservoir system that provides New York City with most of its drinking water.Quietly nestled in the woods, Islamberg remained unnoticed for the two decades leading up to Sept. 11, 2001, when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked by a determined band of Islamic extremists.That s when people started questioning the community s ties to a Pakistani cleric allegedly connected to worldwide terrorism. They also started talking about the unusual sounds of gunfire and explosions some said they heard emanating from the compound.But before you leap to conclusions and head to the Catskills to personally fight the war on terror   you need to know the entire story. The truth, as is often the case, is a lot more complicated than the headlines suggest.Islamberg got its start about 20 years ago, when   inspired by the words of the Sufi cleric Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani   a group of primarily black Muslims from Brooklyn left New York City to escape crime, poverty and racism. Aiming to lead what they believed was a peaceful and holy Muslim life, they built a community of some 40 family houses, their own grocery store and a bookstore.And they weren t alone. Other groups, also inspired by Gilani, have set up similiar communities in 19 other states. According to the group s own Web site, the Islamberg community is still  struggling,  and is asking for donations to complete its mosque.According to locals, the land previously belonged to a Deposit, N.Y., woman who opened up her home in the in the late 1970s or early  80s to disadvantaged youths from the city so that they could avoid being led astray by a financially and morally bankrupt urban environment.Those boys, according to locals who were friendly with some of the group, eventually went on to form Islamberg, and at some point they were joined by another group of more militant Muslims, who created something of a rival faction within the community.The group lived quietly there for years with little interaction with the local communities except for forays into town for supplies or to sell baked goods at the weekly flea market. Some of the men had jobs at a local credit-processing center or working for the Port Authority in New York City (where they are said to maintain a residence near a bridge that runs between two boroughs).In the few instances when they did have relationships with the locals, they were almost always friendly, many said. Sometimes local children would visit their friends in the compound. There was a sense of camaraderie with them,  one woman said.Watch video here:There was a notable exception, a situation involving the local schools in the late 1990s when some of the Islamberg boys got into a scuffle with local boys. They broke my nephew s nose,  said a Hancock, N.Y., woman, who asked that her name not be used.Another man said the Muslim boys  trashed  the school in Deposit.Locals variously blamed the fighting on an angry attitude on the part of the Muslim boys, racism on the part of the local boys or the  usual  relatively trivial events that lead almost all teenage boys into a confrontation at one point or another in their lives.According to Joy Felber, 62, a retired taxidermist who s lived in Deposit for 19 years, the cause lay with a group of local boys who picked a fight with the Muslims. We had some young boys in town who were causing trouble   not from the Muslim community   but they were antagonizing the boys in the Muslim community,  Felber said.  It was lack of knowledge. When people don t know other people, they have a tendency to lash out. And you put two teenage boys together and sparks fly. After a further controversy about whether the Islamberg boys should have been going to public school in Deposit or Hancock (the compound lies on the border between the two towns, and even longtime residents differ on whether it s technically in Deposit, Hancock or nearby Tompkins), the boys were pulled from the schools and the Muslim community drew away from town life.All Islamberg children are now schooled on the compound in a school that, according to one report, has a total of 62 students.",TRUMP GETS HAMMERED [Video] For Not Condemning Question At Town Hall About Muslim Training Camps In US…But He Was Right…And Here’s The Proof

"Sep 19, 2016","Will this FINALLY be the straw that breaks the camel s back? Wow and it s not even October yet! Things are not looking good for #CrookedHillary The House Oversight Committee is reviewing a Reddit post that alleges an IT specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton s private server sought advice on how to alter the contents of  VERY VIP  emails, according to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.).Meadows is the chairman of the panel s Government Operations subcommittee. The Reddit post issue and its connection to Paul Combetta is currently being reviewed by OGR staff and evaluations are being made as to the authenticity of the post,  Meadows told The Hill. Reddit users appear to have uncovered a two-year-old post from an account believed to belong to Combetta, an engineer with Platte River Networks. The Denver, Colo.-based firm managed Clinton s private server.The Reddit Archives that are allegedly Combetta s, can be found near end of article. Combetta was granted immunity from Obama s Department of Justice in their investigation of Clinton.Combetta was the employee who deleted all of Hillary Clinton s emails.According users on Reddit, Combetta asked for assistance in July 2014 from Reddit users on how to purge emails and how to strip VIP s email address from  a bunch of archived emails.  -GPhttps://twitter.com/juliangwan/status/778006379596509184The post, which has been deleted but can be read in images archived by Reddit users, coincides with the discovery of Clinton s use of the server.Busted:Proof of Intent to Obstruct Justice 2 Years Ago from #HillarysHackerReddit Post Reveals. pic.twitter.com/aVgdV8gDla  The Truther (@4evertruther) September 19, 2016 I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email  Basically, they don t want the VIP s email address exposed to anyone, and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out,  reads the post, by a user called  stonetear.

If it is determined that the request to change email addresses was made by someone so closely aligned with the Secretary s IT operation as Mr. Combetta, then it will certainly prompt additional inquiry,  Meadows told The Hill.  The date of the Reddit post in relationship to the establishment of the Select Committee on Benghazi is also troubling. The Reddit message was sent on July 23, 2014, according to an archive of the page saved by other users. The day before, the Benghazi Committee had reached an agreement with the State Department on the production of related records, according the FBI s investigation into Clinton s use of the server.The identity of the  stonetear  user is not confirmed. Reddit users point to the fact that an account on the online marketplace Easy for a Paul Combetta has the username  stonetear  and the inactive website combetta.com is registered to the email address stonetear@gmail.com.Combetta appeared under subpoena in a committee hearing last week on the alleged destruction of evidence, but both he and colleague Bill Thornton exercised their Fifth Amendment right not to testify.borismkv: There is no supported way to do what you re asking. You can only delete emails after they re stored in the database. You can t change them. If there was a feature in Exchange that allowed this, it could result in major legal issues. There may be ways to hack a solution, but I am not aware of any. permalinkembedsavegive goldstonetear: As a PST file or exported MSG files, this could be done though, yes? The issue is that these emails involve the private email address of someone you d recognize, and we re trying to replace it with a placeholder address as to not expose it.exproject: To my knowledge, there s no way to edit existing messages, that s a possibility for a discovery nightmare. To strip/rename on outbound/inbound you could rewrite it with a transport rule.stonetear: That wouldn t work on existing messages though right?odoprasm: Is there no way to access and edb manually?stonetear: I have full access to the server   what are you suggesting with the EDB file?stonetear: I think maybe I wasn t clear enough in the original post. I have these emails available in a PST file. Can I rewrite them in the PST? I could also export to MSG and do some sort of batch find/replace. Anyone know of tools that might help with this?exproject: Just because you have the messages available in multiple formats and locations doesn t change that it s an attribute of the envelope not meant to be rewritten. The functionality is just not built into any tool I know of. Having that functionality would create the ability to screw with discovery (I mean, there could be mitigation with versioning, but that would need other configuration) While it may not be a read-only part of the envelope(I m not actually sure), the only tool that MIGHT be able to do what you want is MFCMapi, and I don t think you want to play with that for this job. The chance of getting it wrong would be pretty high I think and it is not a particularly friendly tool. I m not sure it could be scripted with it either. My recommendation would be what /u/borismkv said. Making a mailbox for VIP and telling them to use that. Forwarding to VIPs mailbox would be ripe for them to just respond directly instead of responding through his relay mailbox. As for your existing messages, if the current users absolutely cannot see the existing messages, you ll need to do a search and export and just forcibly remove the messages from their mailboxes. It s not clean and not advised by me, but if they don t want VIPs address out there it will need to be removed. I would do a search with his email address as the query with -LogOnly -LogLevel Full and see what kind of results you get.EDIT: Holy shit they actually deleted all their comments from a 2 year old reddit post, I think we hit gold on this one. Archive.is link of the deleted reddit postCan somebody make sure we have the twitter posts archived too? I really don t trust twitter to keep those up.  Gateway PunditHere is the ARCHIVE of the messages that were deleted on Reddit.UPDATE: Here s a screengrab of the archived pictures from Reddit:The committee has scheduled another hearing on the  preservation of State Department records  for Thursday.Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has issued a criminal referral asking the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to investigate deletions from the server.This latest probe stems from revelations from the 58-page report issued by the FBI summarizing its investigation into Clinton s use of the server.According to the FBI s report, an unnamed Platte River Networks technician deleted an archive of emails from the server in March 2015   after the House Select Committee on Benghazi had issued a subpoena for records relating to the 2012 attack on the Libyan outpost.According to the FBI s notes, longtime Clinton aide Cheryl Mills instructed Platte River Networks to delete a set of archived emails in December 2014. Mills told investigators Clinton had decided she no longer needed access to emails older than 60 days.But the technician apparently forgot the request and didn t immediately comply. According to the FBI report, between March 25 and March 31 of 2015, the technician  believed he had an  oh shit  moment and   deleted the Clinton archive mailbox from the [Platte River Networks] server. Reporting from The New York Times has since identified Combetta as that technician, citing an anonymous law enforcement official and others familiar with the FBI probe.Clinton and Mills told the FBI that they had no knowledge of the technician s deletion of the emails. The technician, according to the report,  was aware of the existence of the [Benghazi Committee] preservation request and the fact that it meant he should not disturb Clinton s email data on the [Platte River Networks] server.

"Sep 19, 2017","A speech for the ages was given today by President Donald Trump. He addressed the 72nd meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York for the first time in his presidency. The transcript is below.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, world leaders, and distinguished delegates: Welcome to New York. It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. The stock market is at an all-time high   a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time. And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.To put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear.This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Those three beautiful pillars   they re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity.The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time,  Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world.We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success.Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures, and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution   the oldest constitution still in use in the world today.This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity, and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity, and the rule of law.The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are:  We the people. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs.In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our government s first duty is to its people, to our citizens   to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values.As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. (Applause.)All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. But we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return. As long as I hold this office, I will defend America s interests above all else.But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it s in everyone s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations Charter. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall. America s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe to the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion, or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values.That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats, and even wars that we face. Or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today, so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.We were all witness to the regime s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictator s brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea s spies.If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles.The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. That s what the United Nations is all about; that s what the United Nations is for. Let s see how they do.It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. Thank you to all involved.But we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.We face this decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime   one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room.The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran s leaders are, in fact, its own people.Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors. This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad s dictatorship, fuel Yemen s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. (Applause.) The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don t think you ve heard the last of it   believe me.It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran s government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained. And above all, Iran s government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people, and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran s people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers.Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? Or will the Iranian people return to the nation s proud roots as a center of civilization, culture, and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again?The Iranian regime s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing.In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people.The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of ISIS. In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined.We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens   even innocent children   shock the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.We appreciate the efforts of United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process.For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach.For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries.For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform, and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms.For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.I want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Nigeria and Yemen.We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief; the President s Malaria Initiative; the Global Health Security Agenda; the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery; and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.We also thank   (applause)   we also thank the Secretary General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Too often the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process.In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council.The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.Major portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, militarily or financially. Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse.The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch.As a responsible neighbor and friend, we and all others have a goal. That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela. (Applause.)The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. (Applause.) From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action. All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules. And our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government: the duty of our citizens. This bond is the source of America s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the  independent strength of its members.  If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign, and independent nations   nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit.In remembering the great victory that led to this body s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved.Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain.Today, if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts, and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities, and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucrats   we can t do it. We must solve our problems, to build our prosperity, to secure our futures, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was  effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued, and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism.History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself.Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others, and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all: a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth.This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people, and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world: We will fight together, sacrifice together, and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity, and for the almighty God who made us all.Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.",‘One for the Ages’ Full Video and Transcript of Trump’s Incredible UN Speech [Video]

The shooting set off a long night of violent protests and Wednesday the demonstrations continued for a second night, starting off as a peaceful march through downtown Charlotte. But when the demonstrators neared an Omni Hotel, some people climbed the roof of an outdoor mall and started throwing objects at the crowd.Other people were banging on the doors of the hotel, and police in riot gear emerged in the entrance.His family said Scott, an African-American, was unarmed and sitting in his car reading a book, waiting for his son to come home from school.But Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Scott exited his car with a gun, not a book. He said officers couldn t find a book at the scene. It s time for the voiceless majority to stand up and be heard,  said the police chief, who is black.

This is the meat of the interview: I agree with you we are very divided. And maybe this is one of the reasons. A lot of this is disingenuous. Anyone who looks at cyber warfare will tell you, any honest person, will tell you the Chinese military is the primary culprit in the United States, hacked into the White House not too long ago  Nobody said anything. You guys in Hollywood sell your movies in China. You bow to the imperatives of their propaganda and censorship office. You change your movies to suit them. And yet no one says we re at war with China.Notice how Reiner brings up the Facebook ads that the left is now going after because a Russian group spent $100K on ads during the election. So it comes down to the fact that this is an effort at (ironic) propaganda to convince Americans that Russia stole the election. Did you catch that Clapper is part of this??? WTH?

Maybe she ll finally be held accountable for Benghazi. This is going to get very interesting.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has successfully recovered personal and work emails from Hillary Clinton s private email server, according to a new report.Sources told Bloomberg News that some of Clinton s emails have been extracted from the server, thus disproving the claim that Clinton managed to wipe her server clean after she deleted all of her emails earlier this year.Therefore, some of the emails that Clinton deleted   the ones that she determined were NOT relevant to federal investigations   are now in the hands of the FBI.The federal investigation, therefore, is now out of Clinton s control.Outside computer specialists have said the FBI has the technical capability to recover deleted e-mails. The exact number of personal e-mails recovered by the FBI could not be learned. Once the e-mails have been extracted, a group of agents has been separating personal correspondence and passing along work-related messages to agents leading the investigation, the person said. Since the existence of the e-mail system became public in March, Clinton has seen her standing in polls slide, particularly in regards to questions about her trustworthiness. She also has been heavily criticized by congressional Republicans who have raised questions over whether the private server jeopardized the security of sensitive data. Internal government watchdogs have determined that classified information ended up on the system.

Pope Francis paid a short visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor community in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday to support them in their court case over the contraception mandate, the Vatican s spokesman revealed.It was a  short visit that was not in the program,  Father Federico Lombardi, director of the Holy See Press Office, said at an evening press conference during the papal visit to the nation s capital. This is a sign, obviously, of support for them  in their court case, he affirmed.The sisters have filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration for its 2012 mandate that employers provide insurance coverage for birth control, sterilizations, and drugs that can cause abortions in employee health plans. The sisters have maintained that to provide this coverage would violate their religious beliefs.Even after the Obama administration modified the rules as an  accommodation  for objecting organizations, the sisters held that the revised rules would force them to violate their consciences.The majority of a three-judge panel for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in July that the Little Sisters of the Poor did not establish that the mandate was a  substantial burden  on their free exercise of religion, and thus ruled they still had to abide by the mandate.The papal visit was not on the official schedule for Pope Francis  Washington, D.C. visit, which included Wednesday visits to the White House, a midday prayer service with the U.S. bishops at St. Matthew s Cathedral, and the canonization mass for St. Junipero Serra at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.It was a  little addition to the program, but I think it has an important meaning,  Fr. Lombardi said.He added that the visit  is connected  to  the words that the Pope has said in support of the position of the bishops of the United States in the speech to President Obama and also in the speech to the bishops. Pope Francis, with President Obama at the White House, called religious freedom  one of America s most precious possessions  and had hearkened to the U.S. bishops  defense of religious freedom.  All are called to be vigilant, precisely as good citizens, to preserve and defend that freedom from everything that would threaten or compromise it,  he had said.In response to the news of the visit with the sisters, Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville, president of the U.S. Bishops Conference, said that he was  so pleased  to hear of the visit. As you know the last thing the Little Sisters of the Poor want to do is sue somebody. They don t want to sue in court,  he insisted.  They simply want to serve people who are poor and elderly, and they want to do it in a way that doesn t conflict with their beliefs.Via: Catholic News Agency",POPE MAKES VISIT TO NUNS OBAMA REGIME IS SUING For Not Conforming To Obamacare Contraception Mandate

"Sep 26, 2016","Who won the debate tonight? Donald J. Trump or the Lester Holt-Clinton team?NBC News  Lester Holt had his  Candy Crowley  moment at the first debate of the 2016 presidential election on Monday night, bowing to pressure from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the liberal media by  fact-checking  Republican nominee Donald Trump on the question of his support for the Iraq War.Holt lived up to the expectations of his peers. But he lived down to the worst expectations of conservatives, who routinely see Republican candidates treated unfairly by debate moderators.Hillary also went over the 2 minute mark several times, while there were several times when Lester Holt would cut Donald Trump off after only having a little over a minute to answer a question. Again and again, Holt asked Trump tough questions that were straight from the Clinton campaign s talking points, and which were obvious set-ups for Clinton to attack (and for fact-checkers to pounce on whatever Trump asserted in his own defense).Here are the five worst examples.Tax returns. Holt never asked Clinton about her e-mail scandal, about Benghazi, or about the Clinton Foundation and its dubious dealings. But he did ask Trump about his tax returns, arguing   not asking   that there might be questionable information in them that the American public deserved to hear.Birther conspiracy theory. Holt never asked Clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her  super-predator  remarks as First Lady, or her explicit appeal to  white Americans  in her 2008 primary campaign against Obama. Yet he asked Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist.Stop-and-frisk. After an exchange between the candidates over the policy of  stop-and-frisk,  Holt interjected to bolster Clinton s point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in New York because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. Trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over. A presidential look.  Towards the end of the debate, Holt asked Trump about what he meant by saying Hillary Clinton did not have  a presidential look.  He did so after noting that Clinton had become  the first woman  to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting Trump up as a sexist. As Trump answered, Holt interrupted him, then gave Clinton a chance to respond with her talking points about Trump s past comments on women.Iraq War. The question of whether Trump supported the Iraq War or not has been widely debated. What is beyond doubt is that Hillary Clinton voted for it. Holt only represented one side of the debate about Trump, and never asked Clinton about her own vote.

"Sep 26, 2017","Luther Strange will likely be the first and last establishment candidate Trump will make the admitted  mistake  of supporting Roy Moore defeated Alabama Sen. Luther Strange in Tuesday s Alabama Republican Senate primary runoff.The primary took on national importance as President Trump endorsed Strange, while traditional Trump allies, such as former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, backed Moore. They re going to say,  Donald Trump, the President of the United States, was unable to pull his candidate across the line. It is a terrible, terrible moment for Trump,  the president said while imitating news anchors at a Friday rally in Alabama in support of Strange.Strange become a senator when Jeff Sessions left his seat to become attorney general. The senator is a former lobbyist and was backed by a super PAC linked to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Chamber of Commerce, a typical establishment GOP partner. Mitch McConnell and this permanent political class is the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country. They think you re a pack of morons. They think you re nothing but rubes,  Bannon said at a rally Monday in support of Moore.  They have no interest at all in what you have to say, what you have to think or what you want to do. However, Trump contended at his Friday rally in support of Strange that the senator barely knew McConnell, and that the Alabama senator is  determined to drain that swamp. The president would go on to say,  I ll be honest, I might have made a mistake,  and said he would campaign  like hell  for Moore if he were to win the primary. The former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice led the race throughout in the polls, and was up by 11 points in the final public poll.Moore is a major figure in Alabama and became nationally known in 2003 when he was removed from office after defying a federal court s ruling to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the Alabama state Supreme Court building.Like Trump, the former judge has a brash and sometimes offensive manner of speaking. Now we have blacks and whites fighting, reds and yellows fighting, Democrats and Republicans fighting, men and women fighting. What s going to unite us? What s going to bring us back together? A president? A Congress? No. It s going to be God,  Moore said in a campaign speech.  Daily Caller ",BREAKING NEWS: Controversial ALABAMA GOP Senate Primary Race Winner Announced
"Sep 27, 2015","It apparently wasn t shocking enough when the American taxpayer found out the Obama regime spent $500 million to put  four or five  fighters on the ground in Syria. This latest news just adds insult to injury A Syrian rebel commander who recently completed a U.S. training program has told the U.S. military that he surrendered six coalition-provided trucks and ammunition to an intermediary linked to the al-Qaida affiliate in Syria, known as the Nusra Front. U.S. Central Command said late Friday that roughly 25 percent of the equipment assigned to that unit was apparently turned over earlier this week in exchange for safe passage within the region.U.S. officials said the Syrians continue to insist that they have not relinquished any actual weapons to the Nusra Front and that all of their personnel are still accounted for.Air Force Col. Pat Ryder, a U.S. Central Command spokesman, said the command is looking into the incident.But the report contradicts information the Defense Department provided earlier in the day, which said reports of U.S.-trained Syrian rebels defecting and missing equipment going to the Nusra Front were incorrect.The report underscores persistent problems with the U.S.-led coalition s effort to train and equip Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State.Ryder said the Syrians had told the U.S. earlier Friday that no equipment or people were missing, but the U.S. found out later on that some of those assertions were wrong.He said providing equipment to the Nusra Front is a violation of the training and equipping program. In light of this new information, we wanted to ensure the public was informed as quickly as possible about the facts as we know them at this time,  Ryder said.

"Sep 27, 2017","How very bold of the white Yahoo sports writer Greg Wyshynski, who affectionately refers to himself as  Puck Daddy  to call out one of only a handful of black men in the NHL for not standing up for the Black Lives Matter, anti-cop movement, that disrespects our flag, and our veterans in one fell swoop Wyshynski writes: P.K. Subban said on Tuesday that he will  never  kneel during the national anthem to protest something politically.Subban performed at a fundraiser on Tuesday night at Zanies Comedy Club in Nashville, to benefit Comedy Cares. He told the audience that he would  never  take a knee during the national anthem because he has too much respect for the American flag. His comments were sent to us by two eyewitnesses and confirmed by the Predators. Subban, who is Canadian, is considered the most prominent black player in pro hockey.Earlier in the day, the Nashville Predators announced that, as a team, they would not engage in any protests during the national anthem. This came less than two days after hundreds of NFL players, coaches and executives showed solidarity in rebuking President Donald Trump s comments that players who protested police brutality against African-Americans during the national anthem were  sons of bitches  who deserved to lose their jobs.Said CEO Sean Henry, to the Tennessean: When this all came about, we wanted to get together with our team because everything we do is collaborative. When we say what we re going to be doing, it really is a  we.  Everyone had input on it. We are honoring the anthem and the flag and the country by standing during the anthem. We invite our fans to do so with us.  It is also our way of honoring what else it stands for, and it does provide for the freedom for others to express their views and protests in a manner in which they feel comfortable doing. We just think there s proper forums for all. Our games have become this unifying celebration, so we have decided that we re all going to stand together to honor the country and all that comes with it. According to Seth Dean, a Predators fans who attended the comedy fundraiser event, Subban took the stage and said  he will continue to stand, respect, and sing along with U.S. anthem.  At one point, he pointed out a friend of his in the crowd who was a law enforcement officer from Boston.From Dean: He also addressed why he always shuffles his feet during anthem. He first said it could be ADD but he was never tested. Then he mentioned just being pumped up by crowd and excited to support USA even as a Canadian. He even jokingly suggested we should all stand and sing anthem there at Zanies (which didn t happen). He obviously wasn t going to go against Lavy s proclamation that players were going to stay standing, especially with his coach in the room, but he made his support for anthem as unequivocal as he possibly could. In an email to Yahoo Sports, Hailey, another attendee, described the scene in more detail:Tonight was a comedy fundraiser at Zanies in Nashville, for which Ryan Hamilton was the headliner. As my attendance was spontaneous, I was pretty excited when PK Subban was the first  comedian . Much to my surprise, his allegedly  impromptu  set ended with a tense promise from PK that despite his previous dancing antics during the national anthem, he would NEVER kneel during the national anthem, followed by a long rant about his  respect  for the American flag.

"Sep 28, 2017","Watching sports on TV or going to a football stadium to watch a game, used to be a great way to unwind and forget about your troubles at home or at work. Watching sports used to be a stress reliever for many. That was before the NFL and the NBA was hijacked by the politically correct police, and social justice warriors, and morphed into something most fans don t  even recognize anymore.One of the worst cases of political correctness was when liberals insisted that the Washington Redskins change their name so as not to offend Native Americans. The left got very little support from Redskins fans and surprisingly, many in the Native American community were unwilling to join the fight to demand a name change for the team. Eventually, the left was forced to walk away from that fight, and accept that the owners of the Redskins were focused on playing football, and were not interested in their foolish game of political correctness.Today, the NFL is facing a huge backlash from fans, as players are being asked to choose activism over their allegiance to their fans who couldn t care less about their political views, they re coming to escape the stresses of everyday life and to watch these professional athletes play football. They don t come to see professional athletes kneeling on the sidelines during our national anthem in support of the Black Lives Matter anti-cop group, who inspired the killings of several innocent cops, shut down major roads, threatened innocent people who got in their way, and looted and burned cities to the ground. Fans come to relax and to forget about their troubles. They come to get away from the divisive politics and challenges of everyday life. They certainly don t travel to stadiums to attend games or watch them on TV so they can be admonished or scolded for not holding the same politically correct views as the snowflakes on the field.This hilarious cartoon by BenGarrison is a perfect example of who fans are paying to see on the field today:It won t be long before fans stop supporting these snowflakes, and politically correct crybabies, and maybe then, they ll remember why we came ",LOL!

"Sep 29, 2015","Is the Pope s defense of same sex marriage the straw the will break the camel s back for the godless left? Washington, DC   Media is buzzing about the Pope s comments in support of conscientious objection and whether he knows about the Rowan County, Kentucky, Clerk of Court who was jailed for six days for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The Pope met privately with Kim Davis and her husband, Joe, at the Vatican Embassy in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, September 24, which was the birthday of Kim s father. Pope Francis spoke with Kim and Joe Davis in English.During the meeting Pope Francis said,  Thank you for your courage.  Pope Francis also told Kim Davis to  Stay strong.  He held out his hands and asked Kim to pray for him. Kim held his hands and said,  I will. Please pray for me,  and the Pope said he would. The two embraced. The Pontiff presented Kim and Joe Davis each with a Rosary that he personally blessed. Kim s mother and father are Catholic, and Kim and Joe will present the Rosaries to her parents. Kim s mother was the elected Clerk of Court for Rowan County for 37 years until her retirement in 2014.Kim Davis said,  I was humbled to meet Pope Francis. Of all people, why me?  Davis continued,  I never thought I would meet the Pope. Who am I to have this rare opportunity? I am just a County Clerk who loves Jesus and desires with all my heart to serve him.  Kim said,  Pope Francis was kind, genuinely caring, and very personable. He even asked me to pray for him. Pope Francis thanked me for my courage and told me to  stay strong. The challenges we face in America regarding the sanctity of human life, marriage, and religious freedom are the same universal challenges Christians face around the world. Religious freedom is a human right that comes from God. These values are shared in common by people of faith, and the threats to religious freedom are universal. Kim Davis has become a symbol of this worldwide conflict between Christian faith and recent cultural challenges regarding marriage,  said Mat Staver, Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel.Speaking with reporters on board the Papal plane to Rome, Pope Francis told Terry Moran of ABC News that conscientious objection is a human right, even for government officials:  Conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right. It is a right. And if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector, he denies a right. Conscientious objection must enter into every juridical structure because it is a right, a human right. Otherwise we would end up in a situation where we select what is a right, saying  this right that has merit, this one does not.  It (conscientious objection) is a human right. It always moved me when I read, and I read it many times, when I read the  Chanson de Roland  when the people were all in line and before them was the baptismal font and they had to choose between the baptismal font or the sword. They had to choose. They weren t permitted conscientious objection. It is a right and if we want to make peace we have to respect all rights. The ABC News Chief Foreign Correspondent asked if that includes government officials as well, and the Pope reiterated that conscientious objection is a human right:  It is a human right and if a government official is a human person, he has that right,  Pope Francis affirmed.After the above statement of Pope Francis was published, some in the media wondered if the Pontiff knew of Kim Davis.  Not only did Pope Francis know of Kim Davis, he personally met with her to express his support,  concluded Staver.Via: Barbed Wire","BREAKING: Pope Met Privately With Enemy Of Left, Kim Davis"

Mark Steyn responds Posted by Tucker Carlson on Friday, September 29, 2017In case you missed the story of the teacher:Of course, as America has come to expect, Melania  fired back  at the hateful, liberal, public school librarian with class and dignity.  It s so refreshing to finally have a First Lady with class in the White House First lady Melania Trump fired back Friday at a Massachusetts elementary school librarian who rejected her donation of Dr. Seuss books, claiming their illustrations are examples of  racist propaganda. Stephanie Grisham, director of communications for the first lady s office, said in a statement to Fox News that the response was  unfortunate,  and Mrs. Trump wanted to use her platform  to help as many children as she can. She has demonstrated this in both actions and words since her husband took office, and sending books to children across the country is but one example,  she said.  To turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate, but the First Lady remains committed to her efforts on behalf of children everywhere. To celebrate  National Read a Book Day,  the first lady had sent out a collection of 10 Dr. Seuss books to one school in each state across the nation. The titles included:  The Cat in the Hat ;  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish ;  Wacky Wednesday ;  Green Eggs and Ham ; and  Oh, the Places You ll Go! She followed in the footsteps of her predecessor, Michelle Obama, who often read Dr. Seuss books to children. Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Barbara Bush also read to children at Dr. Seuss-themed educational events.Remember when Mooch read Seuss to a room full of kids at the White House? Hmmm was Mooch promoting racism? To turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate.    First lady Melania Trump s office I wanted to send you a special gift. Dr. Seuss s Oh, the Places You ll Go! is a book my son and I have read over and over again, and one that we want to share with all of you,  the first lady wrote in her letter to students.  Please also remember that you are the future of America and that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. But despite the gesture, Liz Phipps Soeiro, a librarian at a public school in Cambridge, wrote a letter to the first lady, which was then published on The Horn Book blog, notifying Mrs. Trump that her school would  not be keeping the titles  for their collection, explaining that her school didn t have a  NEED  for the books, due to her school and library s  award-winning  status.  FOX News100 Percent Fed Up  Soeiro on Tuesday penned an editorial for the Horn Book s Family Reading blog explaining why her school did not need the donation. My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in literary science,  she wrote. Multiple studies show that schools with professionally staffed libraries improve student performance,  Soeiro added.Trump s package reportedly included such Seuss classics as  Green Eggs and Ham,   The Cat in the Hat  and  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. Soeiro criticized Seuss for being the only author represented in Trump s donation, citing controversy over some of his illustrations. You may not be aware of this, but Dr. Seuss is a bit of a clich , a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature,  she told Trump. Another fact that many people are unaware of is that Dr. Seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes. I work in a district that has plenty of resources, which contributes directly to  excellence,  Soeiro wrote.  My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in library science. Soeiro went on to slam the White House and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for not gifting the books to  underfunded and underprivileged communities,  which she suggested  continue to be marginalized  by DeVos  policies.But Soeiro seemed to be the most offended by the books themselves.Another FACT that many people are unaware that the HYPOCRITICAL and smug liberal librarian was seen CELEBRATING Dr. Seuss only 2 years ago:Here's D.C. librarian who rejected Melania's Dr. Seuss book donation ""steeped in racist propaganda"" as Cat in Hat. pic.twitter.com/pek3pT5q2W  Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) September 29, 2017","HYSTERICAL!

"Sep 30, 2015","Remember the report that came out after Hillary left her position as Secretary of State? There was missing money $6 billion couldn t be accounted for. How does $6 billion just vanish? It seems like this is the usual thing with the Clintons. The Clinton Global Foundation also was missing money. Yes, a whopping $17 million went missing! I think we have a couple of Arkansas Grifters on our hands Since Bill and Hillary Clinton left the White House in 2001, they have earned more than $230 million. But in federal filings the Clintons claim they are worth somewhere between $11 million and $53 million. After layering years of disclosures on top of annual tax returns, Forbes estimates their combined net worth at $45 million. Where did all of the money go? No one seems to know, and the Clintons aren t offering any answers.From 2001 to 2014 the power couple spent $95 million on taxes. Hillary s 2008 presidential run cost her $13 million. Their two homes cost a combined $5 million, and the Clintons have given away $22 million to charity. All of this is according to FEC filings, property records and years of tax returns. Add it up and you get $135 million. If the Clintons made $230 million, spent $135 million and have just $45 million left over, what happened to the other $50 million? That s kind of strange,  says Joe Biden s accountant, Walter Deyhle.  You have to report all of your assets. You have to report assets that are owned by your spouse. It seems unlikely that the Clintons could have spent all of it. Over 14 years $50 million averages out to $3.6 million in extra expenses per year, or $9,800 per day. Read the rest:Forbes explores some possible explanations for the missing money but dares not touch on one likely possibility  that when you re running a criminal enterprise the size and scope of the Clinton Foundation, there are many, many people whose silence must be bought, and such folks don t come cheap.It s also possible that Bill s sexual shenanigans have resulted in out-of-court settlements in exchange for confidentiality agreements.And of course, political influence can be a two way street.

Here s EXHIBIT 1 on just how far she ll go While speaking to a group of donors last February, Hillary mocked Bernie Sanders supporters and admitted the  free college  and  free healthcare are just a ploy to win the votes of millennials The Intercept had this to say about Clinton s flip flopping:Clinton has been inconsistent in the past about espousing political labels. She has at times touted herself as stalwart liberal. For instance, she said last July:  I take a backseat to no one when you look at my record in standing up and fighting for progressive values.  But a few months later, she told a group in Ohio:  You know, I get accused of being kind of moderate and center. I plead guilty. AUDIO OF CLINTON MOCKING BERNIE SUPPORTERSCLINTON: Some are new to politics completely. They re children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents  basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don t see much of a future. I met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said,  You know, none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college. And we don t believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance.  So that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics. And so if you re feeling like you re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn t pay a lot, and doesn t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. So I think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be, you know, a wet blanket on idealism. We want people to be idealistic.

Tuesday morning at Orrs Elementary School, 10-year-old Jason Newberry said he and one classmate put their hand over their heart while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. He said when they did, others in the class called them names. Me and him got called KKK, Nazi, and we just kept getting bullied the whole day,  said Newberry.Newberry said it wasn t until his second-period teacher showed them a news clip of NFL players kneeling that he realized the present controversy surrounding the flag.The teacher made a poll on paper and passed it out to all the students to see what they thought was right or wrong about taking a knee. The teacher even told students that she would never stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and that if she did stand she would not really mean it.A spokesperson for Spalding School District tells CBS46 the assignment was supposed to be a lesson on First Amendment Rights, but they wouldn t say if the teacher was disciplined for her comments.In a letter sent home to parents Wednesday, the teacher wrote the following: I apologize for expressing my views to my students. I recognize that while this was not a one-sided lesson, the topic itself and the expression of my views were not appropriate, my intentions were well-meaning.Parents say they plan to stand with their children Thursday morning in front of the school s flagpole when the National Anthem is recited over the loudspeaker.

"Sep 4, 2016","For anyone who believes they re more CONSERVATIVE than the average Trump supporter because they re planning to vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and his running mate, former Governor Bill Weld you may want to re-think your  conservative  position. It turns out, you re really just voting for another Barack Obama without the race card to fall back on or Hillary without the criminal background Libertarians should be allergic to power grabs by the executive for the obvious reason that they lend themselves to concentrated authority and (usually) bigger government. If you want to slow the state down, a robust, sharply divided Congress that jealously guards its constitutional prerogatives from the president should be your ideal   even in cases where the executive happens to be acting towards an end you deem salutary. In this year of all years, admirers of Obama s various forms of overreach should be thinking hard about how President Trump might build on his precedents. To a constitutionalist, which most mainstream libertarians claim to be, all of this is second nature.Is Gary Johnson a constitutionalist?THRUSH: How about Obama s executive order, which was decried as being a great constitutional violation by the Republicans, Obama s executive order on immigration. Did you consider that to be a violation or did you consider that a reasonable use of targeted executive power?MR. JOHNSON: I saw it as a reasonable use, challenging Congress to action. And an untold story with regard to Obama and immigration is he s broken up 3 million families. He has deported 3 million heads of households that have gone back to Mexico and their families have remained in the United States.If Obama issued an executive order to the IRS demanding that they collect 10 percent more in tax from individuals than the Internal Revenue Code provides, would Johnson deem that legal? What if the order instructed the agency to collect 10 percent less tax? Would his opinion of its legality change? Because it shouldn t. Bear in mind, Obama s 2014  DAPA  amnesty has already been blocked by a preliminary injunction that was upheld on review by the Fifth Circuit so Johnson had plenty of legal cover here to say that he s troubled by Obama s procedural approach despite the fact that he happens to agree with the policy ends. Instead he seems to endorse the bizarre legal theory pushed by some leftists that if Congress isn t moving quickly enough for the president s taste in enacting a policy he supports, he can go ahead and  challenge  them by enacting it himself and leaving it to Congress to overrule him if they feel strongly to the contrary. How the hell does a libertarian arrive at that model of government? The president does what he wants, and then it falls to the people s representatives to try to muster a two-thirds majority to override his policy? What?

Weld has also gone on to say that he does not believe Hillary is in the wrong or should be punished for her emails.

"Sep 4, 2017","Contrary to what the media would like us to believe, Obama has not remained silent when it comes to policy that President Trump put in place by executive order. Neither he nor his Democratic henchmen remained silent when President Trump desperately tried to convince Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, or when he had the opportunity to attack him over his handling of the Charlottesville controversy. The media celebrated Obama s post-Charlotseville tweet designed to make our former President look like he was in favor of uniting the nation (which we all know is a bald-faced lie), while falsely giving the impression that President Trump was choosing sides.Before the media gets into a full-blown tizzy about Obama using social media to bash our current president over DACA, they might consider that most of America aren t stupid enough to believe that Valerie Jarrett didn t move into Barack Obama s DC home because he needed a friend to play checkers with. He may not be making public statements to voice his opposition against our current president, but one thing we do know is that he and Valerie Jarrett aren t sitting on their hands, while President Trump unwinds everything they worked so hard to make happen, including DACA.Hotair   You know it s killing this guy not to be on camera every day scolding Trump in his usual  that s not who we are  terms but that would be a strategic disaster so obvious that silence is really the only option. A  Trump vs. Obama  fight over almost any issue would unify most of the right behind the president and O knows it; the most brutal thing he can do to Trump is to deny him that our-guy-versus-their-guy dynamic. I don t think it s crazy to believe that Trump s job approval would be five to 10 points higher if Obama had spent the last seven months sniping at him regularly. By withholding his criticism, he s made it possible for  soft  Republicans and right-leaning independents to criticize POTUS without fear of being accused that they re carrying O s water.Two days before President Trump s inauguration, Obama warned him that he would come out against him if Trump rescinded his unconstitutional DACA.Why attack Trump now? I think there s more to it than DACA just being near and dear to Obama s heart. He knows that congressional Republicans are going to be jammed up here to an unusual degree. Immigration is a fraught issue for the GOP under the best of circumstances but DREAMers are an especially hard case due to their having come here as children. They re the one class of illegals about whom even Trump speaks warmly. In fact, the president s going to end DACA not because he wants to but because Republican AGs are squeezing him to do so, replete with the threat of a court battle; even then, Trump is still so reluctant to pull the plug that he s willing to hold off for another six months. The entire GOP (apart from Steve King) will spend those six months telling every voter who listens that they re open to legalizing DREAMers. All they ask in return is some face-saving security measures so that they can semi-plausibly argue to their base that they didn t roll over completely on amnesty.Having Obama wade in publicly on the side of DREAMers will complicate all of that. With O banging the drum for amnesty, Republican voters who are lukewarm on the idea in the first place will start to turn frosty. Populists will have a field day attacking Ryan and McConnell (and Trump?) for essentially doing Obama s bidding by negotiating for a DREAM bill. Some congressional Republicans might start to get cold feet. The more hostile Trump and the congressional GOP become towards a DREAM deal as part of a backlash towards Obama, the more ammo Schumer will have to say that Republicans are being cruel to poor illegal children whose only mistake was trusting the federal government. The whole GOP  we like DREAMers too!  messaging effort will be scrambled. Either negotiations will end up collapsing in Congress, with Dems using the DREAM failure against Republicans next fall, or Trump, Ryan, and McConnell will have to swallow hard and approve an amnesty cheered on by Barack farking Obama, which is about the RINO-iest move a modern Republican is capable of making. Either the GOP base ends up angry at the White House or everyone else does. Obama  speaking out  is tinder for the match Trump is about to strike.Let s hope President Trump will be able to locate and tweet this pesky little video of candidate Obama telling his constituents how he disagrees with law breaking illegal aliens living and working in America:",OBAMA THREATENS TO SURFACE FROM LEFTIST BUNKER To Speak Out Against Trump’s Plan To End DACA

The section being upheld allows police in Arizona to check the immigration status of anyone they stop.Bolton ruled that immigration rights activists failed to show that police would enforce the law differently for Hispanics than other people. The section is sometimes called the  show your papers  provision.The judge also upheld a section that let police check to see if a detainee is in the United States illegally.

"Sep 5, 2016","After a lifetime of passionate conservative activism and the creation of a very successful activist organization, it s heartbreaking that Schlafly died before she could see the man she risked so much for win the election. Conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly died on Monday afternoon. The  Sweetheart of the Silent Majority  passed away surrounded by family in her home in Ladue, Missouri just a short 10-minute drive from where she was born in St. Louis on August 15, 1924.Her death marks a palpable loss for the conservative movement which, just last month, celebrated the grassroots heroine s 92nd birthday.An accomplished lawyer, activist, author, and mother of six, Phyllis Schlafly has been described as the embodiment of the ideal American woman.As Sen. Jeff Sessions wrote in a statement submitted for the Congressional Record,  dynamic, smart, beautiful, and articulate,  Schlafly has  fearlessly  and  tirelessly  championed the American family and American values. In 1963, the publisher of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat put it this way:  Phyllis Schlafly stands for everything that has made America great and for those things which will keep it that way. Schlafly enjoyed a rich family life. Married in 1949, she and her late-husband, Fred, shared forty-four happy years together as well as six children, sixteen grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.Never one to see her femininity as antithetical to her career goals, Schlafly was awarded Illinois  Mother of the Year only a few years before being named one of the 100 Most Important Women of the 20th Century by the Ladies  Home Journal.Revered for her steadfast judgement, Schlafly was a guiding light to many conservatives, who looked to her to determine the political battles of the day. Most recently, the  godmother of the conservative movement  led the charge against the Gang of Eight amnesty plan and President Obama s Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement.Unafraid to go toe-to-toe with some of the most powerful men in the nation, Schlafly was known for engaging in fights of principle all while projecting her irresistible charm, grace and wit.Schlafly understood feminism not as an effort to erase or wipe away the unique, distinguishing features of women, but rather to embrace and encourage all of the special and wondrous things about womanhood. Whereas modern feminism teaches that a little girl is not so different from a little boy and that society should recognize no real difference between the two, Schlafly celebrated motherhood and femininity, and perceived the differences amongst the sexes as something to be extolled rather than repressed.A vocal proponent for empowering all Americans, Schlafly fought tirelessly against the social institutions that teach the  absolutely false  narrative that  women are victims of the patriarchy and [that] it s up to new laws in the Constitution to remedy this second-class citizenship of women. American women are the most fortunate class of people who ever lived on the face of the earth,  Schlafly proclaimed in 2012.  We can do anything we want to do. Schlafly s life was truly a testament to what she preached. A child of Great Depression, she paid her way through college by putting in 48-hour work weeks as a gunner testing ammunition at the largest ammunition plant in the world, the St. Louis Ordnance Plant. Schlafly tested .30 and .50 caliber ammunition for accuracy, penetration, velocity, and aircraft function before the government would accept the ammunition for the war effort during World War II. Despite the rigors of a full-time job working the midnight to 8am shift at the ordnance plant, Schlafly still managed to finish her schooling in just three years, graduating from Washington University in St. Louis Phi Beta Kappa.She then went on to get her master s degree in Government from Harvard University in 1945, and her J.D. from Washington University Law School in 1978.Schlafly was active in politics for more than one-quarter of all American history.She began volunteering for the Republican Party in 1945 when she worked as a campaign manager for Claude Bakewell, a successful Republican candidate for Congress. Schlafly attended every single Republican National Convention since 1952 and has been at the center of nearly every major political battle since then.Beginning in the 1950s and 60s, Schlafly was instrumental in helping to launch the anti-Communist movement by forming 5,000 study groups throughout American homes to inform grassroots voters about the evils of Communism.As an activist, Schlafly seemed driven by her mission to  educate [conservatives], train them, and stand up for them  [and to] let the grassroots be heard. An advocate for truth and the free dissemination of information, Schlafly spoke frequently of the need for  news people who put out the truth instead of the packaged truth that the strategists have written.   Breitbart91-year-old Phyllis Schlafly was in the fight of her life against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) supporters within her organization. Schlafly appeared in court to fight to retain control of her legacy and the organization she founded over 40 years ago.Watch Phyllis bravely endorse Donald Trump at his St. Louis rally in March, 2016:https://youtu.be/2qfCQ4riXO0The grassroots heroine and conservative icon appeared in Madison County, Illinois to defend her organization, Eagle Forum, against those inside her organization who are attempting a coup.As Breitbart News has previously reported, the internal strife within Eagle Forum is connected to Schlafly s decision to endorse GOP frontrunner Donald Trump over Texas Senator Ted Cruz. When explaining her support for Trump, Schlafly cited Trump s strong positions on promoting pro-America trade policies, curbing immigration, and defending national sovereignty   issues which are very important to Schlafly.The suit was filed by Schlafly s own daughter, Anne Schlafly Cori, and four other Cruz supporters within Schlafly s organization: Eunie Smith, Cathie Adams, Carolyn McLarty, and Rosina Kovar. Shirley Curry, the only other member of the so-called  Gang of Six  who is a plaintiff in this case, has not taken a public position on the presidential race.","92 YR OLD CONSERVATIVE ICON DIES: Only 4 Months Ago Her Daughter, 5 Cruz Supporters Tried To Fire Her From Organization She Founded For Supporting Trump"

According to the party, the board responded with a list of 1,101,178 individuals, though its website reflects 1,115,664 votes cast. There should never be more votes than voters every ballot cast should be recorded against a registered voter,  Chairman of the Chicago GOP Chris Cleveland told Fox News, explaining that after receiving the data, the party  immediately  contacted the board for  clarification.

"Sep 6, 2016","You know the Left has won when communism replaces education A freshman tentatively raises her hand and takes the microphone.  I m really scared to ask this,  she begins.  When I, as a white female, listen to music that uses the N word, and I m in the car, or, especially when I m with all white friends, is it O.K. to sing along? The answer, from Sheree Marlowe, the new chief diversity officer at Clark University, is an unequivocal  no. The exchange was included in Ms. Marlowe s presentation to recently arriving first-year students focusing on subtle  microaggressions,  part of a new campus vocabulary that also includes  safe spaces  and  trigger warnings. Microaggressions, Ms. Marlowe said, are comments, snubs or insults that communicate derogatory or negative messages that might not be intended to cause harm but are targeted at people based on their membership in a marginalized group.Among her other tips: Don t ask an Asian student you don t know for help on your math homework or randomly ask a black student if he plays basketball. Both questions make assumptions based on stereotypes. And don t say  you guys.  It could be interpreted as leaving out women, said Ms. Marlowe, who realized it was offensive only when someone confronted her for saying it during a presentation.Clark, a private liberal arts college that has long prided itself on diversity and inclusion, is far from the only university stepping up discussions of racism and diversity in orientation programs this year.Once devoted to ice cream socials, tutorials on campus technology systems and advice on choosing classes, orientation for new students is changing significantly, with the issue taking on renewed urgency this year as universities increasingly try to address recent racial and ethnic tensions on campuses as well as an onslaught of sexual assault complaints and investigations.A bystander intervention presentation for arriving freshmen at Wesleyan University last Thursday    We Speak We Stand    featured students acting out fictional episodes of campus sexual violence, harassment and problematic drinking, with examples of how to intervene.  Each of you has the power to bring to light sexual violence in our community,  one student told the group.In August, the University of Wisconsin system, which includes the Madison flagship and 25 other campuses, said it would ask the State Legislature for $6 million in funding to improve what it called the  university experience  for students. The request includes money for Fluent, a program described as a systemwide cultural training for faculty and staff members and students.But that budget request has provoked controversy.  If only the taxpayers and tuition-paying families had a safe space that might protect them from wasteful UW System spending on political correctness,  State Senator Stephen L. Nass, a Republican, said in a statement issued by his office, urging his fellow lawmakers to vote against the appropriation.Mr. Nass s objection to spending money on diversity training reflects a rising resistance to what is considered campus political correctness. At some universities, alumni and students have objected to a variety of campus measures, including diversity training;  safe spaces,  places where students from marginalized groups can gather to discuss their experiences; and  trigger warnings,  disclaimers about possibly upsetting material in lesson plans.Some graduates have curtailed donations and students have suggested that diversity training smacks of some sort of communist re-education program. -Via NYT s",FRESHMAN ORIENTATION: It’s Racist To Ask Asian Students For Math Help…Don’t Ask Black Students If They Play Basketball…And MORE Insanity You Won’t Believe!

"Sep 7, 2015","This is a perfect example of how the left is able to decide which laws they follow and which laws the rest of America follows Kim Davis, the Democrat Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses because of religious objections, was ordered to jail for contempt of court last Thursday. She suggested a compromise of removing her name from the licenses, but Federal District Court Judge David Bunning wouldn t even grant that reasonable compromise.Contrast this with Cathy Lanier, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, refusing to issue concealed weapons permits to people unless they can arbitrarily show a  good reason,  nothing required by law. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in May stopping her from denying the permits, although notably he did not send Lanier to jail for contempt.Similarly, county sheriffs in California had been denying concealed weapons permits to applicants who failed to show a need beyond self-defense. Last November, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the sheriffs were violating the law. None of those sheriffs were sent to jail, despite the fact that people around the country have died unable to obtain a permit to carry concealed.Or contrast it with the irony of San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordering clerks to issue same-sex marriage licenses in 2004, contrary to state law. The California Attorney General sued him and the California Supreme Court ultimately put an end to the practice, but Newsom was never sent to jail.Newsom also violated federal law by making San Francisco a sanctuary city in 2007, contrary to existing federal law, but nothing happened to him. The city s sanctuary status resulted in the death of Kate Steinle in July, who was shot by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times and had seven felony convictions. This is a far more drastic result than a clerk who merely does not want her name on marriage licenses, yet nothing is being done to the current mayor of San Francisco, Ed Lee. In 2012, Tonya Parker, a lesbian judge in Texas said she would not issue marriage licenses to heterosexual couples until same-sex marriage was legalized. She wasn t put in jail for violating the law, nor does it appear she was even disciplined at all.Not everyone would have taken the position Davis did, some Christians might have resigned rather than deal with a huge battle. Others might not have had such strong objections, viewing matters of sexuality best left alone and without government interference. When I was an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Arizona, I represented agencies like the Arizona Commission on the Arts. Philosophically, I disagreed with its very existence. But I was able to separate my personal views from government laws to perform my job.The one thing all reasonable people can agree upon is that Davis was singled out and punished disproportionately compared to other public officials who didn t comply with controversial laws.This isn t about same-sex marriage, nor is it even about gay issues. It is merely one tactic in a larger goal to remove Christianity from the public sphere. There are reasonable compromises that could have been made between those Christians with conscientious objections and the LGBT community   plenty of gays consider themselves Christians   but the left is deliberately pushing for maximum conflict between the two groups in order to push one out of society.An Oregon judge announced on Friday that he will not perform same-sex marriages. Unlike the lesbian judge who said she would not perform heterosexual marriages, Judge Vance Day was immediately put under an ethics investigation by the Oregon Commission of Judicial Fitness and Disability, which plans to hold a hearing in November.This won t end with public employment. As the public sphere goes, so goes the private sphere. If companies balk, anti-discrimination laws can be used to force them to comply. The left intends to stamp religion out of society, until Christians are left secretly worshiping in their homes, hiding their status outside of the home. This is because the left fundamentally disagrees with Judeo-Christian ethics, which contradict its foundation of anything goes.Until conservatives wake up and start realizing the judicial branch, controlled by the left, has become the most lethal branch, the biggest threat of the three branches to our country and freedom, it will continue abusing the legal system to stamp out conservatism and religion from society.

"Sep 7, 2016","Make America Conservative again. There really isn t any downside It might be time to rethink the millennial voter.A new paper suggests that Americans are more politically polarized now than they ve been in the past 46 years, and millennials are guiding this trend.The young adults, who were born between 1980 and 1994, are currently more politically polarized than Generation Xers and Baby Boomers, according to the paper, which was published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin on Wednesday. Additionally, millennials are more likely to identify as conservative than either Generation Xers or Baby Boomers were at the same age, said Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University and lead author of the paper. High school seniors are more likely to identify as political conservatives now compared to 10 years ago. Most surprising, more identify as conservatives now compared to the 1980s, presumably the era of the young conservative, such as the character Alex P. Keaton in the 1980s show  Family Ties.  That goes against the common view of millennials as very liberal,  said Twenge, author of the book about millennials titled  Generation Me. So the current view of millennials as liberals might be due to their age   young people are more likely to be liberal. But if you compare young people now to young people in previous decades, those now are more conservative,  she said.The data showed that, as entering college students, 23% of millennials identified as leaning far right, compared to 17% of Baby Boomers and 22% of Generation Xers.Less than half   47%   of millennials identified as  middle-of-the-road,  compared to 50% of Baby Boomers and more than half   53%   of Generation Xers.Millennials have surpassed Baby Boomers both as the United States  largest living generation and as the largest generation in the American electorate.

A video has emerged showing the interview where Hillary told Amanpour that she believed the DACA kids should be sent back.During the exchange, Clinton had some tough words for the children of illegal immigrants, including waves of unaccompanied minors coming in 2014   telling Amanpour that the United States was a nation of laws and that they probably had to go.Watch at the 2:20 mark: The exchange went like this:AMANPOUR:  So, you re saying they should be sent back now? CLINTON:  Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back. But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families. And just as Vice President Biden is arguing today in Central America, we ve got to do more. I started this when I was secretary to deal with the violence in this region to deal with border security.But we have so to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn t mean the child gets to stay. So, we don t want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey. Of course, Hillary is never one to keep her promises. As soon as she began campaigning, she began to change her tune on DACA: Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back,  said Clinton.  But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families. ",HILLARY TWEETS MESSAGE In Defense Of DACA…OOPS! 2014 VIDEO Of Hillary EMERGES Saying Illegal Kids Should Be Sent Back
"September 1, 2016","Campaign volunteers are key to a winning presidential campaign. Unpaid supporters are the most solid of true believers in a politician, and most campaigns would do anything to attract them and get them doing the grunt work that wins elections.Not Donald Trump.His so-called  ground game  of volunteers in swing states has been slow to catch-up with Hillary Clinton s massive operation that have been working to register voters and get them to the polls since before the primaries began last winter.But another reason Trump is behind the curve may be his own ego. It has come to light that as part of volunteering for Trump s 2016 presidential campaign, volunteers must sign an unusual non-disclosure agreement document that bars them from ever speaking about him:The Enquirer reports that the agreement  is a required part of the sign-up process for Trump Red Dialer, an online call system that connects volunteers for the Republican presidential candidate with potential voters,  and that a spokesman dodged a question about why they re necessary. We are running a state-of-the-art campaign for Mr. Trump that involves best-in-market volunteer platforms, and it is attracting thousands of volunteers who are tired of the same old Washington corruption and back room deals and are securing votes for a change in November,  Trump Ohio spokesman Seth Unger said.The contract specifies that volunteers could face financial damages if they violate the agreement by speaking about Trump. Similar agreements have been discussed before in the campaign, as one was apparently signed by former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. The extremely expansive terms of the agreement led to him losing a book deal, and he actually could face a major lawsuit   as another former campaign staffer did, later settled   if he even criticized the campaign as part of his work as a commentator at CNN.ThinkProgress reports that by comparison, the Clinton campaign doesn t require anyone to sign anything before working for the campaign as a phone banker. Sounds like they want to win, instead of stroking the candidate s ego.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons", Trump BANS Campaign Volunteers From Talking About Him FOREVER
"September 1, 2017","Donald Trump is an insane narcissist. We all know that. However, actor Matt Damon just revealed just how bad Trump s narcissism is   and it is positively frightening when it comes to such a person having the nuclear codes. As we re all well aware, Donald Trump owns bunches of gaudy buildings around the world. Since they are so unusual, it s only natural that they could be great locations for shooting movies. However, with Trump being Trump, there was a crazy catch that showed just how much of a narcissistic bully the orange man that is currently squatting in the Oval Office is.Apparently, in order to have access to Trump s buildings for the purpose of filming, directors were forced to allow Trump to have a part in whatever was being filmed. Damon says of this bizarre detail: The deal was that if you wanted to shoot in one of his buildings, you had to write him in a part. Martin Brest had to write something in  Scent of a Woman    and the whole crew was in on it. You have to waste an hour of your day with a bullshit shot: Donald Trump walks in and Al Pacino s like,  Hello, Mr. Trump!    you had to call him by name   and then he exits. You waste a little time so that you can get the permit, and then you can cut the scene out. But I guess in  Home Alone 2 they left it in. Damon went on to express dismay at the way Trump is running the nation and says of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into the Russian hacking that took place in the 2016 election: [H]opefully his investigation is going smoothly. He can t wrap things up soon enough, as far as I m concerned. Damon also had quite a few things to say about Trump s white supremacist fan boys: [T]o see these young, aggrieved, white boys walking with their torches and screaming  Jews will not replace us!  It was just shocking. Then the night that the president [made his]  many sides  comment was absolutely abhorrent. Matt Damon is right on all accounts. It is shocking. Everything that is happening is shocking, and not in a good way. Donald Trump is destabilizing our democracy right before our very eyes, and the people in a position to do something about it will do nothing. Hopefully, Mueller finishes up soon, and we get rid of these people post haste.Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images", Matt Damon Just Revealed A HUGE Secret About How Narcissistic Trump Really Is
"September 10, 2016","For some reason, the Trump campaign is utterly clueless about the alt-right movement and what it stands for. Trump himself regularly retweets stuff from those deplorable (oops, we said it) excuses for human beings and then brushes it off, if he even says anything at all. He even enthusiastically tweeted an image of himself as Pepe the Frog, a mascot for the Neo-Nazis, which is bad enough given that Trump keeps saying he ll work for all Americans.One of his top advisers, Roger Stone, now, is saying he s proud to walk alongside Trump as a symbol for the Neo-Nazi movement while he s protesting Hillary s  basket of deplorables  comment aimed at half of Trump s followers.The irony is strong in this one.Stone thinks he s going to turn the word  deplorables  around the way that President Obama turned  Obamacare  from something derogatory into something with his signature on it. He will make this backfire on Hillary, because of course. It s his own idea that s backfiring though   all he s done is prove that an awful lot of Trump s supporters are really deplorable people.Image via TwitterPepe the Frog has been around for awhile, to be sure. It recently became unacceptable, however, as the Neo-Nazis began working towards claiming Pepe as a racist, white nationalist symbol.So now Pepe represents what he was always supposed to represent, and he s in a likeness of Donald Trump. Roger Stone has an image co-opted from  The Expendables,  showing Trump as a Neo-Nazi mascot, that he s put on social media.And he s probably amazingly proud of his ingenious idea.This isn t the first time Trump s been depicted as Pepe. In 2015, Trump retweeted a different image of himself as Pepe standing in front of an American flag, and behind a podium. The alt-right worked to associate their mascot with Trump because they believe that Trump represents them. And who wouldn t?

White nationalists, who make up an awful lot of the alt-right, are far more hateful and discriminating than Hillary ever could be.The truth is that these are people who think that immigration equals white genocide. Some on the alt-right hate women and everything to do with women. A lot of them think that some races are inherently more stupid than others, and deserve to be treated as such. These are people who are as anti-Semitic as Adolf Hitler.In short, they re deplorable people, and Stone is busy complaining that Hillary called them what they are while directly associating Trump with them. Any reasonable campaign and any reasonable adviser would find a different way to make that backfire on Hillary   the Trump camp is too entrenched with the alt-right and too full of itself to realize what they ve actually done, though.Featured image via screen capture from Roger Stone s tweet", Trump Adviser Just Proved Hillary’s ‘Basket Of Deplorables’ Comment Correct With One Image
"September 10, 2017","Leave it to Donald Trump to disrespect both the heroes and victims of a massive hurricane.Earlier today at the White House, Trump spoke with reporters about the devastating effects Hurricane Irma will have on Florida and the surrounding areas. Trump also assured everyone that he would be traveling to the damaged areas soon to provide assistance. But what grabbed everyone s attention were Trump s comments to the Coast Guard as he praised them for their efforts.Everything started well as Trump commended the Coast Guard for their response to the hurricane. However, Trump ruined his speech by showing America that he still doesn t know how to be presidential and cannot tell the difference between what is appropriate and what is not in a dire situation. While Hurricane Irma rages on, Trump felt it was the perfect time to talk about the Coast Guard s branding. Yes, really. Trump congratulated the agency on raising its image, completely overshadowing any praise about their efforts. Trump said: A group that really deserves credit is the United States Coast Guard. What they ve done   I mean, they ve gone right into that, and you never know. When you go in there, you don t know if you re coming out. They are really   if you talk about branding, no brand has improved more than the United States Guard. Once again, it s very clear that even in times of great tragedy and danger, all Trump cares about or pays attention to is image and ratings. This was totally disrespectful to the Coast Guard as well as to those suffering due to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. Branding is the last thing we should be concerned about here.You can watch Trump s ridiculous speech below:Pres.

"September 11, 2016","The right-wing was quick to claim that Clinton had experienced her own  47% moment  with her  basket full of deplorables  remark. But nothing could be further from the truth. Clinton s remark turns out to be fairly accurate.In fact, if anything Clinton actually undersold just how deplorable Trump s supporters actually are. During an appearance on CBS s Face the Nation on Sunday, Slate s chief political correspondent, Jamelle Bouie explained how the statement Clinton made is supported by scientific evidence.Bouie looked at polling data that showed that more than half of Republicans believe that President is a Muslim or was born in another country. So, I m inclined to see it as strategy and not so much as a gaffe because when I heard the remark, my first question was: Well, is this true? Right? Regardless of how it sounds, what it looks like, what is the case about Donald Trump supporters?  Bouie asks.  And if you break down the numbers and you look at the RealClearPolitics average, and it gives Trump, 43 percent of the registered voters, there re about 30, 31 million people. Compare that to polls show 65 to 70 percent of all Republicans who say that Barack Obama either wasn t born in the United States or is a Muslim. If one doesn t think that believe that birtherism is a bad enough belief to hold to earn the title of deplorable, then Bouie has the data to show that roughly have of Republicans are racist. You look at pilot data from the American National Election Study, and it shows upward of 40 percent of Republicans saying things like blacks are more violent, blacks are lazier, Muslims are more violent, Muslims are lazier,  Bouie points out. Among Trump supporters in particular, 60, 50, 70 percent of them agree with statements that political scientists categorize as being explicitly racist,  Bouie continues.  So I m looking at Clinton s statement, and half, which is about 31 million people again, doesn t really seem that out of bounds. Forty to 50 percent of Republicans, I would say looking at the full spectrum of data, agree with beliefs that we would categorize as explicitly prejudiced. So regardless of whether or not Clinton needs to walk it back or not, I think she s being correct and accurate. Conservatives are angry at Clinton because they still cannot accept that pointing out bigotry and racism do not make the person bringing it up racist. Clinton may have half-heartedly backtracked on her statement; her sentiment was worded poorly even if it was accurate.As Bakari Sellers pointed out on Sunday While on CNN s State of the Union, it doesn t matter how many of Trump s supporters are bigoted racists or not because they are all supporting a candidate who is a bigot.There is no left-wing conspiracy out there to make Republicans and trump supporters like deplorable.

"September 11, 2017","The Trump administration has been getting absolutely pummeled for its refusal to acknowledge climate change, even as it becomes more obvious in our surroundings.On Monday, CNN s Jim Acosta tore Trump s Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, apart in front of everyone for the administration s ignorance. Acknowledging the fact that several massive hurricanes have been ravaging the United States, Acosta cornered Bossert, asking him if Trump and his administration  saw a connection between climate change and homeland security and that the frequency and intensity of powerful storms like Harvey and Irma can pose a problem for future administrations  and if the storms were  giving the administration some pause when it comes to the issue of climate change and homeland security. Bossert was almost beside himself as he said: Causality s something outside of my ability to analyze right now. We continue to take seriously the climate change, not the cause of it, but the things that we observe. Then, Acosta nailed him and the entire Trump administration for their stupidity and ignorance: When you see three category 4 hurricanes all on the same map at the same time, does the thought occur to you,  Jeez, you know, maybe there is something to this climate change thing and its connection to powerful hurricanes?  Or do you just separate the two and say,  Boy, these are a lot of hurricanes coming our way? Bossert, nearly crumbling in front of the entire room of reporters, responded: There is a cyclical nature to the hurricane seasons and I thank the scientists for their forecast on this particular one. They were dead on that this would be a stronger and more powerful hurricane season with slightly more than average large storms making landfall  So we ll have to do a larger trend analysis at a later date. Trump s administration is being challenged by the obvious evidence for climate change, and now they re being called out for it. No one can ignore what is currently happening in our environment, and the enormous impact it will have if Trump s administration doesn t wake up.

"September 12, 2016","North Carolina, which is still butthurt over the Supreme Court s decision not to allow their voter suppression law to go into effect before the election, is getting a touch creative with their reasons not to allow early voting. What if a person votes, and then dies?We wish we were making this up.Alas, though, we aren t. Dallas Woodhouse, North Carolina s GOP executive director, tried his best to sound extremely worried about this non-existent crisis when he spoke to Fox 8 about it: We have a situation here where you have to be alive on Election Day. If you vote early, you still have to be alive in a very close race you could literally have dead people voting. We have a situation here.  Har de har har.  Dead people voting  has been one of the GOP s drumbeats regarding voter fraud for a long time, and, of course, on their planet, voter fraud actually only occurs when Democrats are able to vote. Early voting is one of those areas, but absentee voting, for some reason, isn t.Gee, could it be because the majority of people who cast absentee ballots in North Carolina are white, elderly and Republican? The majority of people who cast ballots during early voting are primarily minority and Democrat. From a reasonable perspective, if North Carolina were really worried about dead people voting, they should be targeting absentee voting, not early voting.North Carolina does have a law requiring that voters be alive on Election Day for their votes to be counted, even if they cast an early or absentee ballot. There are, however, contingencies in effect should someone who voted early die before Election Day. They re outlined by North Carolina Board of Elections general counsel Josh Lawson, below: All early voting is done on retrievable ballots,  he said.  If a person dies, the county board of elections is notified by the Social Security Administration or the Registrar of Deeds. They have a pretty good system for tracking deaths. When we become aware of it, we remove that ballot.' North Carolina is busy what-iffing itself off the edge of the sanity cliff here. With each comment, they increasingly prove that their voter suppression law was all about suppressing the minority vote.Featured image by Sara D.

At 69, she s not in the best of health, and is actually on oxygen. Nevertheless, she heckled the deplorable Trumpkins outside the rally: Why did I get involved yesterday, at my age? Because I ran into another situation that was sickening my heart. She admits to telling one Trumpkin he d better learn to speak Russian, at which point he socked her. She fell on her oxygen tank and has sore ribs and a sore jaw, but nothing s broken.

Not only did he rape the small child, but he did it on camera so he could livestream the sexual assault for another pervert to watch online. Investigators believe that the attack was premeditated, and also that he had plans to rape a 3-year-old boy in the same manner.Grooms was arrested in March 2014, when he was 17. Initially, he was charged with second-degree sexual abuse, a felony that could have put him in prison for 25 years. However, after spending two years in a juvenile detention center and county jail, he cut a deal and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of engaging in a lascivious act with a child in July. This week, Judge Randy Degeest handed Groom, who also goes by the alias Kraigen Simmers, a 10-year suspended sentence and sent him home.This means that he will see absolutely no prison time for raping a 2-year-old. Let that sink in for a minute.This is just the most recent in a string of high-profile sexual assault cases that have ended with the rapist getting a slap on the wrist and being sent on his way. The most well-known of these cases being that of Brock Turner, who raped an unconscious woman behind a dumpster and was given just six months in jail, but ended up only serving three before being released.Is there any question that anyone who rapes a toddler   a f*cking toddler   should be behind bars until hell freezes over?

Since then, the GOP has instead embraced a hard-right nativist stance, opposing immigration reform even when it has strong popular support.By contrast, Democrats have now completely taken up the mantle of being pro-immigrant.Featured image via screen capture"," Hillary Talks Taco Trucks, SHREDS Trump, And The Crowd Goes WILD (VIDEO)"
"September 15, 2017","One thing that most conservatives have in common with Donald Trump   and perhaps contributes to the reason they relate to him and supported him for POTUS   is chronic misogyny and sexism. We saw this play out on Friday during a panel discussion on CNN, when an anchor had to shut the segment down abruptly due to a highly inappropriate comment from her Fox guest.CNN s Brooke Baldwin had Fox Sports Radio host Clay Travis as a guest, and the exchange went downhill very quickly. The panel was addressing the incident in which ESPN s Jemele Hill had called Trump a white supremacist, causing the White House to demand her be fired. When Clay Travis had his turn to give his opinion on the matter, he made Baldwin wish she d never asked him. Travis said this: I believe in the First Amendment and boobs. Baldwin was practically speechless, and had to do a double take, asking him if he d actually just said the word  boobs.  Travis only made it worse: Boobs, two things that never let me down, the first amendment and boobs. Those are the two things I believe in absolutely in the country. Baldwin still couldn t believe her ears, and wanted to give Travis another chance and the benefit of the doubt. She asked him once more to clarify that he d said  boobs  instead of  booze.  Once she confirmed that Travis had definitely said  boobs,  she shut the interview down right then and there. She said: I m done, I m sorry. I m done. This conversation is over, yanking mikes, bye. Forgive me, live television happens and you think you heard something, you are not sure and then you realize it happened, so I apologize for him on that. Right after the segment, Baldwin and Travis were both seen on Twitter, reacting to what had happened in two totally different ways. Baldwin seemed horrified and shocked, and Travis was, of course, proud of himself.What Travis said is not okay, and must be condemned.

In fact, analysts have determined that the 2016 GOP nominee is a  global  threat. They say that he poses a greater risk than terrorism   coincidentally, one of Donald Trump s favorite fear-mongering talking points.It isn t just President Obama s duty to defend us against threats like Trump. It s all of ours., and we have the most powerful weapon available: the ability to vote.

"September 16, 2017","About a month ago, Donald Trump shocked the country by responding to a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in a way that was completely vile. Defending white supremacists and stating that  both sides  were responsible for the violence, Americans across the country were horrified that such a racist message could come from the President of the United States. And now, some areas of the country are standing up to it.California is now sending a strong message to Trump and his administration in response to the horrific endorsements Trump has given to white supremacists. The lower house of the California legislature has just passed a resolution that is demanding that Congress censure Trump so that the undeserving POTUS is clear that We will no longer tolerate his behavior. Assembly member Tony Thurmond said: The leader of the free world can t continue to use language that legitimizes the actions of extremists groups that promote hate. Congress must exercise its power to check the president by voting for his immediate censure. While a GOP-dominant Congress likely won t censure Trump, this initiative marks the first attempt to censure a sitting President since 1834   and that should send a strong message. The Hill also reports that California is trying to get other states to join them in similar ways, demanding that Trump should  publicly apologize to all Americans for his racist and bigoted behavior. This bill follows Trump s own resolution in which he tried to condemn the attacks in Charlottesville. However, he continues to fall short with his weak statements. Refusing to denounce the specific hate groups that are responsible, Trump instead spoke against racism in all forms.  Here s Trump s weak, spineless statement: We condemn the recent violence in Charlottesville and oppose hatred, bigotry, and racism in all forms. Hours before, Trump had doubled down on his horrendous  both sides  comment, stating that counterprotesters were also to blame: You have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also. When you look at really what s happened since Charlottesville, a lot of people are saying and people have actually written,  Gee Trump may have a point. That is seriously disgusting. For that statement alone, Trump deserves the treatment he s getting from California.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images", GOP Implodes As California Passes Bill To Make Congress Censure Trump’s Racism (DETAILS)
"September 17, 2016","In case you didn t know, there was an explosion in Lower Manhattan Saturday night, resulting in a reported 26 injuries. Luckily, none of those injuries are life threatening at this time. However, that does not make such an event any less frightening or tragic for New York City, or for our country. Right now, the appropriate response is to help the victims if we can, to spread only correct information, and stay informed. That isn t the response from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, though.When news of the explosion broke, Trump was speaking to a large crowd. He announced the explosion, and, just as he did after the horrific massacre at Orlando s Pulse Night Club, used the event to congratulate himself. He touts the need to  get very tough,  and sows fear. Trump says: Just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what s going on, but we are living in a time when we ve got to get very tough, folks. We ve got to get very, very tough. It s a terrible thing that s going on in our world and in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant. We re gonna end it. We re gonna end it. After that, he praised his Colorado crowd and said how awesome it was to be there, and then touted his poll numbers, saying: And a new poll from Emerson just came out and we re up four points in Colorado! Watch the video below, via Dave Itzkoff s Twitter:Trump in Colorado, telling crowd that a bomb just went off in NY.

This is no time to be touting poll numbers or trafficking in fear. As Americans, we do not use tragic events to congratulate ourselves or to scare people into doing as we wish. This is what demagogues throughout history have done, and that is just what Donald Trump is   a dangerous, bigoted demagogue. History tells us how that situation ends.

"September 17, 2017","When Americans think about state-run television, we don t expect it to happen here. When we turn on the local news at night, we expect straight news, a rundown of the facts regarding local and national events. If we want opinion shows, we know where to go. If you re a conservative, there s a plethora of shows to watch on Fox News that offer soothing confirmation bias, such as Tucker Carlson Tonight, Hannity, or Fox and Friends. If you re a liberal, you can get the same on your side of the aisle on MSNBC with The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell, The Rachel Maddow Show, or All In with Chris Hayes (though, to be fair, while they are opinion shows, the latter network doesn t lie, while Fox does). However, all of that could be changing.It turns out that many of America s local stations are owned by a company called Sinclair Broadcasting. That company happens to be pro-Trump. They are now going to have 174 stations around the country that will now be airing pro-Trump items on a daily basis, and those shows will be broadcast to the unsuspecting viewing public as actual news. According to Politicus USA, those shows will consist of the following:  The Terrorism Alert Desk, advertised as a daily news update about terrorist activity.  News pieces from Epshteyn, Sinclair s chief political analyst.  A clearly labeled opinion show featuring Mark Hyman, a former vice president of the company.This is especially dangerous, because Americans do not expect to be forced to watch propaganda mixed in with their news. They just want the truth, or shows that are clear opinion. That is not what this is, though. This is nothing more than the kind of stuff Kim Jung Un s regime is feeding his people in order to brainwash them. This is the kind of thing we see in authoritarian states, and it is incredibly dangerous for democracy.People keep saying not to compare Trump to a dictator, but it is becoming more and more clear that this is exactly what he is aiming to be   and he has plenty of help from his blind followers in high places.In short, beware, folks, because you re about to get a big dose of America s very own state-run propaganda.Featured image via William Thomas Cain/Getty Images", Your Local News Station Might Be Turning Into A Pro-Trump Propaganda Network Right Before Your Eyes
"September 18, 2016","A Dallas police officer, seeing red after several shootings of police officers, has decided he s had enough and he and his lawyer, are going to punish everyone they absolutely can for allegedly conspiring to create a race war. Yes, this is the same  race war  that the entire right sees whenever people call attention to the racism that permeates our justice system.Police Sergeant Demetrick Pennie, a 17-year veteran of the Dallas police force, is suing leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement   along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, billionaire George Soros, Louis Farrakhan, former Attorney General Eric Holder, President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and many more. The bizarre part is that he and his attorney, right-wing nut Larry Klayman, actually see an active conspiracy here: This is a civil action for the deprivation of Plaintiffs and other members of the class herein of their civil rights, conspiracy against the Plaintiffs and other members of the class herein civil rights and obstruction of justice to prevent the enforcement of civil rights. The complaint also says this: Klayman received a call from Defendant New Black Panther Party and Black Lives Matter acting in concert with the other Defendants, all of whom are working together to ignite and continue the race war they have fomented, threatening to kill him and his family.  [emphasis mine]In discussing the July 7 murders of Dallas police officers, the lawsuit states that the shooting suspect claimed he was acting alone, and was not affiliated with Black Lives Matter or anything else. An investigation into his background allegedly revealed that he was a member of the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party.Apparently, that s enough to tie him and these groups directly to Hillary, Obama, Holder, and everyone else, although it s hard to see how Klayman and Pennie actually know there s a conspiracy here.It s like they just know   the complaint repeatedly states something along these lines: Defendants, acting in concert, and each and every one of them are inciting the imminent serious bodily injury and killing of police officers and other law enforcement persons Acting in concert  means there s a knowing cooperation between two or more people to accomplish something. There s no real, concrete evidence that anybody is actively working with anyone else to incite violence against police officers. Yet, they keep using that phrase. We do not think it means what they think it means. Either that, or a frightening amount of paranoia fueled this. Or both.It s probably both.The complaint also accuses everyone of spreading the fiction that police officers  are intentionally and systematically targeting and hunting blacks and other minorities to kill them for no reason other than racism or sport.  Exaggerate much, Klayman? Lords, gods and minor deities, it s amazing these conclusions are in an actual complaint filed in an actual court.Other known problems, such as arresting or shooting black people not guilty of any crimes, and that minorities are arrested and prosecuted disproportionately to the general population, are fiction on the planet from whence this complaint arose, too.Klayman, however, has been looking for a reason to file a suit like this for some time. Back in July, he threatened to sue Obama, Farrakhan, Sharpton and Black Lives Matter for putting his life in danger  as a white person.  At the time, he said things like this: It is no wonder some cops, fearing for their lives in this anti-white, anti-Semitic and anti-Christian environment, sometimes are prone to literally pull the trigger too quickly. He s not exactly the most credible person here. He has an axe to grind, and it doesn t make Pennie look good for retaining him for this suit (or did Klayman persuade Pennie to finally give him what he needs to make a suit stick? We may never know).The discovery phase of this lawsuit ought to be interesting.The entire 66-page complaint is below:[scribd id=324251965 key=key-2XEsBrU2vkK8S40trOMu mode=scroll]Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images"," A Dallas Cop Just Filed Suit Against Obama, Hillary, Black Lives Matter For Really Bizarre Conspiracy"
"September 18, 2017","The name sounds familiar, right? Here s why: He used to be Judge Roy Moore, that one guy from The Dukes of Hazzard. Roscoe, you get them Duke Boys in here now! No, wait.Oh, that s right   He was Chief Justice Roy Moore, of the Alabama Supreme Court. Remember the dude back in 2003 who refused to remove the monument of the Ten Commandments from the grounds of the courthouse? That s him. He s one of just a handful of judges who have ever been removed from office in this country by a judicial panel. Funny enough, he got re-elected to the position a decade later, but got smacked down again, this time because he told Alabama judges to ignore the Supreme Court and continue turning away same-sex marriage license applicants.Now Ol  Roy wants to serve in the Yoo-nited States Senate, taking the place of Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who vacated his Senate seat after his appointment to the Department of Justice.The problem is, like the guy before him (who shares a namesake with that guy in the white hat), Roy Moore is an unrepentant racist. I m pretty sure when Roy kicks the proverbial bucket, his headstone is going to read  Jesus Christ Was A White Man. So it was with no small amount of suppressed horror that the world watched the Formerly-Honorable Roy Moore call Native Americans and Asians  reds and yellows  at a campaign event on Sunday: We know that we were torn apart in the Civil War. Brother against brother, North against South, party against party. What s changed? Now we got blacks and whites fighting. Reds and yellows fighting. Democrats and Republicans fighting. Men and women fighting. What s gonna unite us? What s gonna bring us back together? A president? A Congress? No, it s gonna be God.

"September 19, 2016","Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned  rapists  and  drug dealers  from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a  temporary measure.  He s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad: The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don t kid yourself. When they say they don t care about their lives, you have to take out their families. But he s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism   he s fighting the  narratives  of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump s  narrative  is  kill them all :Last weekend s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we re in more than a fight about  narratives    these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.Pay attention to that last bit:  They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens. Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is  radical Islamic terrorism,  and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating  terrorists? They re protecting each other, but they re really doing very bad damage they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,  Trump said in March.  When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that s a big problem. If Muslims are  protecting  terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists  families. How would he define terrorism?These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself   but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents  security to  see what happens  to them (shortly after suggesting that  Second Amendment People  could deal with them. We re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the  little red button  that launches our nuclear arsenal.It s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen   one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He s said it himself. Many times.If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation   to assume office, it will not end well.

"September 19, 2017","By now, everyone knows that Dylann Roof, the South Carolina white supremacist who shot up am historic Black Church in Charleston South Carolina, did it because the parishioners were Black. They invited him to their worship service, and after he sat there with them for more than an hour, he killed them. Well, Roof has been sentenced to die, and his case is not in the appeals process. Like all people, no matter how despicable, Roof is entitled, via the law, to a competent defense. Since he cannot afford his own team of attorneys, they have been provided for him in the form of public defenders. There s just one problem with that, though: According to Dylann Roof, his lawyers are the wrong color.Appointed to represent Roof are public defenders Alexandra Yates and Sapna Mirchandani, who are Jewish and Indian, respectively. Those facts seem to be the only things that are wrong here, rather than their actual defense of Roof. This isn t the first time race has entered into Roof s court proceedings; he had similar mishaps with his original attorney during the trial portion of his ordeal. The man representing him during that time, David Bruck, is Jewish. Roof said of the issues there: His ethnicity was a constant source of conflict even with my constant efforts to look past it. Trust is a vital component in an attorney client relationship, and is important to the effectiveness of the defense. Because of my political views, which are arguably religious, it will be impossible for me to trust two attorneys that are my political and biological enemies. To that end, the racist murderer, who seems to be more or less representing himself at this point, penned a missive from prison, firing his public defenders on the basis of their ethnicity:As if all of this weren t bad enough, Roof threatened his original lawyer, David Bruck, with death if he ever got out of prison.Luckily, the judge presiding over Roof s case sees his racism for what it is, and is denying this so-called  motion. In short, if anyone deserves the death penalty, it s this piece of less-than-human excrement. No sympathy here, despite my usual opposition to the death penalty. If anyone deserves to die for his crimes, it s Dylann Roof.Featured image via video screen capture from ABC News Video", Racist Charleston Church Shooter Seems To Think He Is Entitled To A Literal White Supremacist As His Public Defender

"September 2, 2017","Donald Trump has now become well known for his completely inappropriate tendency to disrespect those who should be honored. We ve seen it numerous times in Trump s efforts to congratulate and honor members of the military, and we witnessed it again earlier today.On Saturday, Trump visited Houston, Texas to assist a Hurricane Harvey relief effort. While he was there, Trump attacked the media several times   but the most notable one was the incident that happened at the expense of the Coast Guard.In speaking with military officials and first responders who were responsible for saving lives in Texas, Trump couldn t help himself from going after the free press. Trump congratulated the Coast Guard, right before uttering this disgusting attack while pointing directly at the cameras: I hear the Coast Guard saved almost 11,000 people by going into winds the media would not go into. They will not go into those winds unless it s a really good story, in which case they will. For someone who wants the media to be nicer to him and protect his fragile ego, Trump sure doesn t know how to behave himself. The hilarious thing about what Trump just said is that several members of the media did far more to help Harvey victims than Trump did. If he would turn off Fox News for a second and actually pay attention to real news, he would have known that several media figures were helping the Coast Guard and other first responders in their relief efforts. There have even been several documented instances in which reporters directly assisted Harvey victims WHILE they were working. But of course, we can t expect Trump to take the high road   ever.

But in America s current climate of fear and unease about what will happen with health care in this country, it was President Obama s speech that was particularly emblematic of the struggle we face in determining the outcome of the American way of life when it comes to insurance, medical care, and ongoing health concerns.This is in stark contrast with what we see in everyday life in America, where we seemingly can t even agree on whether or not white supremacists are bad, or if it s okay to run over protesters. We are engaged in a fight for our very lives, and at least legislatively speaking, Obama knows how hard it looks from where we are.From the video you re about to watch: [W]hen I see those people trying to undo that hard-won progress, for the 50th or 60th time, with bills that would raise costs or reduce coverage, or roll back protections for older Americans or people with pre-existing conditions   the cancer survivor, the expecting mom, or the child with autism, or asthma, for whom coverage once again would be almost unattainable  it is aggravating.And all of this being done without any demonstrable economic, or actuarial, or plain common sense rationale   it frustrates.

Although he is diplomatic here and does not call out Donald Trump and the Republicans by name, it is vital that we hold them to account.

"September 21, 2017","What is it with the Trump administration and spending tax dollars on things that are literal luxuries? Tom Price, Secretary of Health and Human Services, just got busted spending taxpayer dollars traveling on private planes   something to the tune of $300,000 already. Private travel on the taxpayers  dime is apparently the norm for Price   he s been doing this since he took the helm over at HHS.According to a report from Politico, Kathleen Sebelius and Sylvia Burwell, both of whom headed up HHS under Obama, tended to travel on commercial airlines when flying domestically. Price s officials claim that he only uses private jets when commercial travel isn t feasible, but most of these flights are between big U.S. cities where many airlines regularly fly. For instance, he took a private jet from Washington, D.C., to Nashville, but there are four nonstop flights per day between those two cities, with fares as low as $202.Even if he insisted on flying first class, that flight would have been considerably cheaper with average ticket prices around $1,000. His private jet from D.C. to Nashville cost $17,760.Most of his flights are to areas where he speaks about the opioid epidemic, and these engagements are planned well in advance so he could book his flights well in advance, too. It s not like most of his travel is at the last minute due to the nature of his job, or his  demanding schedule,  which is another excuse HHS officials are using.His spokespeople also claimed that he was taking private jets because he was just so amazingly busy directing recovery efforts in the hurricane-ravaged areas of Texas and Florida. However, Politico says that at least 17 of these private flights happened before Hurricane Harvey. There s no way he could possibly have been needed for recovery efforts for a hurricane that hadn t happened yet.One of those flights was from San Diego to the Aspen Ideas Festival in June. That s a swanky festival in the swanky resort town of Aspen, CO, and he spent taxpayer dollars on that. While it s true that he was speaking during a panel there, he arrived 19 hours before that panel, so it s really hard for him to claim that he had to book a private jet because this was too last minute. An average of 26 percent of the flights that go into Aspen are scheduled commercial   it s not like it s impossible to fly commercial into Aspen-Pitkin. Price s plane could have cost us as much as $7,100. Commercial flights cost well under half that.This administration is all about wasting taxpayer dollars, but cutting needed spending, while pretending to stand for regular Americans.

Skirting it under the rug or blaming it on drug use doesn t make it go away.The statistics tell us all we need to know:So, even with all these glaring statistics, Mike Pence thinks talking about it has been  far too much  for his and Trump s comfort.Newsflash, Pence: you re running for Vice President of the United States, not Vice President of the white community. If the talk is too much, get out of the race.We already know Trump doesn t care about the black community nor does he want to actually fix anything that afflicts it, but Pence was supposed to give the illusion that a potential Trump Administration would care. That s been shattered.Good luck getting the black vote in November when you completely wish to disregard what hurts them the most: systemic racism.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Pence Says There Is ‘Too Much Talk’ About Racism In Policing And Institutional Bias
"September 22, 2017","Trump s desperation to convince people that the Great Liberal Media Conspiracy Against Him is real is getting way out of control. On Twitter earlier, he cried that nobody was asking about the media s totally biased coverage of Hillary during the election. He also claimed at a rally a while back that the press was turning their cameras off during his speech because they didn t want their audiences to hear what he had to say. CNN made him look stupid for that. Then tonight, in Alabama, he did it again, and CNN made him look even worse for it.He said,  Fake news. They won t show this,  referring to his obsession with his crowd sizes. He then went on to say: They ll say  Donald Trump spoke before a small crowd in Alabama last night. It was a small crowd. A very unenthusiastic crowd. It was a terrible evening. CNN had split the screen between him and his crowd before he started this diatribe. Seriously   he said this while CNN was showing his crowd. Watch below:Trump says the fake news media won t show the crowd at his rally   while CNN is literally running a split screen of the crowd. pic.twitter.com/mRtPaAr38Z  Jim Dalrymple II (@JimDalrympleII) September 23, 2017In fact, according to Jim Dalrymple II, CNN had been running the split screen for most of the rally.Trump might be able to convince his fans that the media is dishonest, but anyone who can actually think can see just how badly he s embarrassing himself whenever he talks about the  fake news  media.

"September 23, 2016","Nobody shouted  all lives matter  until people started saying,  black lives matter.  There s an easy, albeit disgusting, reason for that and it s because the  all lives matter  crowd is uncomfortable with actually focusing on massive social problems that they perpetuate. Also, the crowd that tends to shout  all lives matter,  is overwhelmingly, white, straight, cisgender, and Judeo-Christian.But  all lives matter  isn t racist, sexist, religion-phobic, transphobic, homophobic, or anything at all to this crowd.There s a Facebook post making the rounds that describes the hypocrisy of this white, straight, cis, Judeo-Christian crowd that s feeling left out because we say  black lives matter.  It s absolutely brilliant. It s so brilliant that it s easier to post it than it is to explain it.Image via FacebookAnd there is the hypocrisy in all its vile glory. Holloman s take on  all lives matter  is amazing. All lives do not matter. The only lives that matter to the  all lives matter  crowd are those of the straight, white, cis, Judeo-Christian crowd. They wouldn t know the meaning of the word  all  if it came up and spit fire in their faces.Explaining why  all lives matter  is such a terrible thing to say first takes convincing that particular crowd that there s even a problem. White people who like that phrase won t acknowledge there s a problem, as recent, blatant racism from various officials has demonstrated. So saying the black community is still oppressed, and floating statistics, telling stories, even getting first-hand accounts and testimonials to prove it, is a massive waste of time.These analogies might be a waste of time, too, but they explain it a little better:#AllLivesMatter is like I go to the Dr for a broken arm and he says  All Bones Matter  ok but right now let s take care of this broken one  Belac Micheal (@djsoap92) July 6, 2016saying #AllLivesMatter is like running through a cancer fundraiser & saying  THERE S OTHER DISEASES TOO  judes (@judychen_) July 8, 2016#AllLivesMatter is like someone tweeting  Pray for Nice  and I say  what about all the other cities in the world?

Your neighbor, whose house isn t burning, comes over and says,  My house needs water too, hellooooo!! Why are we ignoring my house and focusing only on yours?!  What are you going to say?In short,  black lives matter  is calling attention to an emergency situation like the ones above. Black lives do not matter nearly as much as white lives, and it s a serious problem. But Holloman s post illustrates not just the ignorance and offensiveness of  all lives matter,  but it shines a very uncomfortable light on those who continue to utter that phrase.Holloman is right.

"September 23, 2017","James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama, appeared on CNN s Erin Burnett Out Front on Friday night, and he told Burnett just what many Americans have suspected since January. Speaking about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, Clapper told her that the intelligence community had met with Donald Trump prior to his inauguration. In that briefing, he and other intel chiefs discussed with Trump a joint assessment by the CIA, FBI, and NSA that concluded that the interference was significant enough to warrant concerns over the outcome of the election: Our intelligence community assessment did, I think, serve to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his victory in the election. Although Clapper didn t say it in the interview, the unspoken implication is that this message may have prompted Trump s ridiculous overreactions to his inaugural crowd size, the myth that millions of  illegals  voted in the election, and any number of other actions and statements that led to the creation of Trump s laughable  Commission on Election Integrity,  which has, thus far, served only as a vehicle for promoting voter suppression.Clapper s CNN appearance was timely. It came just a short while after Trump went back to his favorite outlet, Twitter, to vent his frustrations for the millionth time:The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 22, 2017Unfortunately for Trump, the fact is that the Facebook ads purchased by Russia weren t even part of that discussion with Clapper. Those weren t discovered until recently, after Facebook combed through their ad sales records and discovered hundreds of fake Russian profiles buying pro-Trump and pro-conservative ads on the social media platform during the campaign. That means that completely independent of any allegations about ad buying, the intelligence community had already concretely agreed that Russia helped Trump win the election.Even after the transition to Trump s administration and Cabinet, the investigation into Russian interference produced the same responses from different intel chiefs. When Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked Trump s own CIA head and his new Director of National Intelligence whether they believed that Russian intelligence agencies were responsible for the hacks and leaks that led to the investigation, both Mike Pompeo and Dan Coats agreed.Clapper told Burnett that Trump s demeanor during the January briefing has been completely different than his behavior since he was inaugurated, calling the earlier Trump  solicitous, courteous, [and] even complimentary  when he sat down with the agencies.Trump is getting more than a little nervous now, and this interview with James Clapper sheds light on his renewed efforts to brush aside the Russia investigation.Watch:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Former Director Of National Intelligence Says Russia Interference Casts Doubt On Trump’s Win
"September 24, 2016","Throughout the past 19 years, Donald Trump has been sued no less than eight times for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act at his various properties, and has done his best to drag out these cases for as long as possible. In addition, a federal inspection at one of his properties also turned up multiple ADA violations.Five of the cases ended in a settlement and two others were resolved in consent decrees that required Trumpto make modifications to the properties to bring them into compliance with the ADA. One ended when both sides requested the case be dismissed and another was brought to a close in a bankruptcy.Christine Da Silva, a Trump Hotels spokeswoman, claims that Trump works very hard and spends lots of money to make sure his buildings are accessible to people with disabilities. It is the policy at all of our properties to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. This handful of cases, many of which are over ten years old, are not representative of our organization s strong record of ADA compliance. However, that  handful of cases  is pretty damning and doesn t support Trump s claims.In a suit filed in 1997, James Conlon, who is paraplegic, filed a lawsuit against Trump s Atlantic City Plaza Hotel alleging basic and serious deficiencies in accessibility. He stayed at the hotel and although he was placed in a room that was supposedly accessible, the toilets and showers were not usable by someone in a wheelchair. As for the public restrooms, they were so inaccessible he had to ask for help from strangers to be able to use them at all. A year later, Trump settled the case and agreed to renovate the accessible guest rooms and public restrooms, bringing them into compliance with the ADA. But a year later, Trump admitted to a judge that the renovations had yet to be completed.In 2001, a suit was brought by Robert Levine and Frieda Zames, who are both wheelchair users. They alleged that Trump International kept the wheelchair lift locked and when employees finally managed to locate the key, they had no idea how to use it. Levine said the degrading incident made him feel like a  second-class citizen.  Zames said it was as if  she were a  grade school child asking permission to go to the restroom.  In an attempt to shift the responsibility, Trump blamed the architects. The case was  amicably settled  in 2009 after both sides decided to dismiss the case.In 2003, Conlon filed suit against Trump once again, this time alleging the bus between New York and the Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino was only accessible to wheelchair users if notice was given at least a week in advance. Naturally, Trump sued the bus company and said it was all their fault, but he eventually settled the case.In 2004,  a disabled Purple Heart veteran filed suit against the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York, alleging the property was not equipped with adequately accessible emergency exits, guest rooms and restrooms. Trump did everything he could to get rid of the suit, besides just making his hotel accessible to people with disabilities, that is. He attempted to have the case dismissed and dragged it out for three years. Just like in 2004, Trump blamed the architects and even launched a countersuit, which a judge called bullsh*t on and dismissed.Helena Berger, the president and CEO of the nonprofit American Association of People with Disabilities, said Trump s relentless attempts to squirm his way out of the suit were  appalling. What was so striking and frankly appalling was the way he tried to fight [the violations].,  Berger said.  That, I think, is really telling. The Plaza Hotel became the subject of another complaint in 2007, which the plaintiffs eventually agreed to dismiss. Yet another lawsuit was brought against the hotel in 2008 but came to an end when Trump s company declared bankruptcy in 2009.In 2011, the Trump Taj Mahal settled with the Department of Justice after an inspection by the U.S. Attorney s Office turned up a long list of ADA violations. And more recently, in 2014, Trump claimed that making the pool at the Trump National Doral Miami golf course would impose an undue burden.  Four months after the suit was filed, Trump and the plaintiffs entered into a consent decree.Featured image via video screen capture ", Trump Has Been Sued REPEATEDLY For Disabilities Violations At His Properties
"September 24, 2017","Donald Trump is facing seriously fierce blowback for his attacks on black athletes who choose to protest racism and police brutality by taking a knee during the national anthem before games. Everyone from owners to players to players to former players are giving Trump a big middle finger during Suturday s games on Sunday, and former NFL star Chris Kluwe didn t stay out of the fray. During an interview with CNN host Fredricka Whitfield, Kluwe, who believes he was blacklisted in the league for speaking out for LGBTQ rights, did not hold back. First, Whitfield asked: This display of kneeling at the national anthem on a football field started a year ago with 49er s Kaepernick and now has evolved into something else or perhaps has blossomed into the same thing but in a bigger way. Chris, what statement do you see NFL teams, owners, coaches making when they kneel, touch, lock arms on display like this? Kluwe responded: Well, I think that the players and the teams are saying that they are not going to be dictated to by a racist, fascist white supremacist who currently occupies the highest place in our government. When you look at what Donald Trump has said about speaking out against Nazis, I think it s fantastic that players and owners are now taking a stand in using the platform to speak out against this because this is not what America is. America is not a fascist military state where its devotion to the flag above all. Right now our nation is not holding up its end of the social contract, especially with communities of color. It should be a baseline right now that you can walk down the street and not get shot by a police officer for carrying a toy gun or for selling cigarettes out of the back of a car. It should not be out of the ordinary to expect that. So I m glad to see these players and owners taking a stand. Communities of color within our nation are not receiving the same level of justice that white communities are,  he added.  Black members of our society are far more likely to be put in prison for what white members are able to skate by on. But it s also morphed into a discussion that we have a person in charge of our society that does not understand what it means to wield the American empire, and has shown no willingness to work with minorities, with immigrants, with anyone who is not white, and that is, again, against the heart of what America stands for. Kluwe is spot on. These players do not suspend their First Amendment right when they take to the field. Further, Donald Trump should not be using the bully pulpit of the White House to try and get people fired for demonstrating for justice. These players are using their platforms to bring awareness to a very serious, and literally life or death, issue in America s communities of color. There s nothing more patriotic that they could do.Trump, on the other hand, is no patriot. Kluwe is correct   Trump IS a racist, a fascist, and a white supremacist. Kudos to these sports teams for standing up to this bullying.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture"," ‘Racist, Fascist, White Supremacist’: Former NFL Star Chris Kluwe Scorches Trump Over His Attacks On Atheletes"
"September 25, 2016","Lately, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been making a show of reaching out to black voters. Of course, it hasn t been actual black people he is speaking to; after all, other than Uncle Tom types like Omarosa and Don King, that s a voting bloc he s never going to win. No, he s trying to send a signal to white voters who can t stomach voting for an overt racist that he s not, well, racist. He s trying to make them forget all the racist garbage he s spewed throughout this campaign and throughout his life.Perhaps the most despicable part of this so-called  outreach  is the fact that he is using the black community to try and score political points. He is going to black churches and troubled communities to try and convince people that he cares. Well, one place that Trump tried to use on his crazy outreach tour has completely rebuffed him: The International Civil Rights Center and Museum in Greensboro, North Carolina.According t0 Earl Jones, co-founder of the museum, Trump s team made a list of exploitative demands that disrespected the museum staff and insisted upon special treatment for Trump   including closing the place down for hours on end so that Trump could come. Well, that wasn t happening for sure, Jones said. The co-founder went on to say of the Trump camp s request: We did not honor the request of the Donald Trump team because we thought they demonstrated, in their approach was disrespectful, so therefore we did not grant that request.The approach, the type of disrespect, pretty much a demand and bullying us to use the museum in their manner and their way in their time,  it was inappropriate and I think it s probably reflective of the type of insensitivity of civil rights and human rights that s reflective from Trump over the years. Who wouldn t want to be a fly on the wall when Trump got THIS news? That was probably a temper tantrum for the ages. Kellyanne Conway probably had to take his phone for hours on end so that he wouldn t attack these people on Twitter for daring to stand up to his blatant and aggressive attempts to use them to score political points.Anyone who isn t completely tone deaf here knows that Trump doesn t give a damn about black people   or anyone else, for that matter   and it s about time that some of these places stop allowing Trump to use them to engage in his disgusting brand of dog whistle racist politics.Well done, International Civil Rights Center and Museum, and Earl Jones.

"September 25, 2017","Conservatives cheered when Pittsburgh Steeler Alejandro Villanueva, who s also a combat veteran, came out and stood for the national anthem while the rest of the team stayed in the locker room. They won t be happy with what Villanueva has said about it since, though. They think he s just like them, a jingoist among a sport full of traitors to America, and this is really going to ruin that.First off, it doesn t look like Villanueva intended to be defiant this way:Villenueva asked Ben after Sat night meeting if he could be out in front with captains.

He couldn t walk out then  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017So it looks like there might have been some miscommunication about what they were doing, or maybe that Villanueva wasn t totally sure what the team had agreed to do.He also said he knew, every time he saw the flag on a fellow soldier s shoulder during a mission, that they were fighting for each other. He also did say,  People die for the flag; there s no way else to put it  There s nothing else that would justify dying for that mission.  (It s likely the mission he meant was whatever mission he and his fellow soldiers were on, rather than the mission of fighting for the flag that Trump fans are glomming onto).But it s what he says about how he feels about what happened that will have Trump fans seething.

"September 26, 2017","Alabama s Republican runoff election for Jeff Sessions  vacant Senate seat has come to its end, and the candidate that will go up against Democrat Doug Jones in December s general election is none other than Roy Moore. Moore is the former chief justice of Alabama s state Supreme Court, and he s the one who ordered all of Alabama s probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court s ruling on same-sex marriage in 2013.But Moore wasn t Donald Trump s candidate. Luther Strange, who has been holding Sessions  seat, was the man backed by Trump. In fact, Trump was at a political rally for Strange last Friday when he called for NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to be fired. The president s endorsement usually helps a candidate, yet it s Moore who just won. Here s a little background on Moore: He was yanked from the Alabama Supreme Court s bench in 2003 for refusing to remove a massive monument to the Bible s 10 Commandments from the grounds of the courthouse. That s considered a violation of the First Amendment since it constitutes a government endorsement of one religion.In 2012, Moore won his job back, then called same-sex relationships  sodomy,  and decried the immorality of it all in the wake of the Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage across all 50 states. He wanted to bar Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison from serving in office because he s a Muslim, and he accused Obama of using our military for social experiments (including wiping out  don t ask, don t tell  and allowing transgender individuals to serve).He has also defended Putin because Putin seems to agree with him on the issue of LGBTQ rights. One might think that would earn him Trump s endorsement, but somehow, it didn t.All of that should have made this election a tossup given conservatives  current love of Trump, but it didn t. Moore was polling ahead of Strange pretty much the entire time. Why?Well, Trump, for starters. That buffoon endorsed Luther Strange and bragged about it all over Twitter, up to and including through today. He boasted that Strange s numbers had skyrocketed since his endorsement, but according to NBC News, Trump s endorsement actually pushed people towards Moore. Trump won Alabama by double digits last year, but it seems they re souring towards him now.That makes this Trump s fault, at least partly. Voters claimed that his endorsement didn t affect them one way or another, but those who were influenced by Trump said he pushed them away from Strange. What that means is that some Republican voters chose Moore because Trump backed the other candidate.That s a massive blow to Trump. Maybe Alabama voters are ashamed of Trump, and they d have good reason to feel that way. For instance, speaking on the  Rick and Bubba  radio show, which is based out of Birmingham, Trump said: Luther Strange is going to be a great Senator. He loves Alabama, he loves the states and he loves the country. He will absolutely win against the Democrat.Ray will have a hard time. If Luther wins, the Democrats will hardly fight. If Ray wins, [Democrats] will pour in $30 million. Moore s first name is Roy. When Rick Burgess, one of the show s hosts, pointed out that he d gotten Roy s name wrong, Trump actually said that it s not a good sign if the president doesn t know his name. Then he said: I don t know that much about Roy Moore. Roy Moore is going to have a very hard time getting elected against the Democrat.Against Luther they won t even fight. When news of Moore s win came out, Trump tweeted the following:As noted above, the general election is December 12. That tweet has since been deleted, and replaced with one noting the correct month for the general.Where is Trump s influence, then? Rosie Gray of The Atlantic said: The outcome of the special election primary will help answer the question of  who is more influential with Trump s base: Trump himself, or the constellation of powerful voices on the right to whom base voters listen and who are supporting Moore? Well, it seems that Trump doesn t have the influence he thinks he does. Especially given that Strange was likely a far better candidate for Senate than Moore ever could be. Moore is an absolute disaster. He s a danger to the U.S., and in deep-red Alabama, there s very little chance that a Democrat can win Sessions  Senate seat. And Trump s endorsement of Strange is partly responsible for this. He s a blight on the GOP and a blight on the nation as a whole. He s dangerous, and Moore s election is evidence of that.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images"," The Worst Possible Person Just Won Alabama’s Runoff For U.S. Senate, And It’s All Trump’s Fault"
"September 27, 2016","The Media Research Center, a right-wing media analysis organization, held its annual black-tie affair last week. The Baltimore police officers who are directly responsible for the death of Freddie Gray last year attended, were brought up on stage, and applauded and honored and giving a standing ovation for their work, all while a right-wing talking head glossed over the problems of police brutality.Deneen Borelli, a frequent Fox News contributor, complained loudly that these cops  lives and careers were ruined by the  lies  surrounding Freddie Gray s death. Gray died after his spine was nearly severed due to a rough and unsecured ride in the back of a van. He was handcuffed and put in leg irons, but not belted in at all. Later, officers said he d suffered a medical emergency, but they failed to get him help.Borelli lamented: These five men and one woman, all veteran police officers, were now in handcuffs, fighting for their lives, their careers destroyed, bankrupted, humiliated No one apologized for ruining their lives. No one thanked them for their service or recognized their honor. Who will thank these officers? Who will thank all police officers   at a time they are being so vilified? Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we will. This is disgusting.Patently disgusting.The media doesn t jump to vilify the police   we have a serious problem with police brutality, particularly against the black community, and the media is shining a light on it. In Baltimore, officers who were witnesses to the case were also on the team investigating Gray s death. Lead detectives started their own counter-investigations to disprove the state s case. The system works for officers, and against their victims.Victims like Freddie Gray. While Borelli whines that nobody s apologized to these officers who, in her view no doubt, were merely doing their duty and then braved the aftermath with grace and courage, Gray is still dead. He died as a direct result of these officers  actions.To point this out, though, makes us anti-police. We re police-haters when we point out brutality. Idiots like Franklin Graham say the best way to stop this is for people to just comply with police orders, and yet, many of the black people who die are complying with police orders.Seriously, the Media Research Center ought to be ashamed of itself for this.

"September 28, 2016","Donald Trump is in deep sh*t because he refuses to apologize for sexist remarks he made about a Miss Universe contestant.During the presidential debate on Monday night, the Republican nominee took serious flack for fat-shaming Miss Universe contestant Alicia Machado just because she didn t conform to Trump s beauty standards for women.Hillary Clinton took Trump to task, informing him that Machado has a name and is going to vote in this election as are millions of other women across the country who also don t appreciate how he has treated women.On Tuesday, after Trump continued to insult Machado on Fox & Friends, the ladies of The View discussed his remarks and refusal to apologize, and even conservative panelist Jedediah Bila was disgusted by his behavior. Now this guy doesn t know how to apologize it seems, because this happened a long time ago and everybody has a past and all of us have said things that maybe we sit and say  I regret it,  the Fox host began.  It s seems though he doesn t regret it, because the comment here, the only acceptable remark is,  You know what? That was a long time ago when I was a different man and I m sorry. I m deeply sorry that I said those things. But Trump didn t apologize just like he has never apologized for any of the offensive remarks he has made over the years. He couldn t even apologize for his birtherism. That shows character, there s a character flaw here,  Bila declared before slamming Trump s supporters for blaming everyone around Trump instead of holding Trump responsible for his own personal words and actions.  And everybody wants to blame his handlers and say,  Why isn t he being told,  and I say, you know what, you re a grown man running for president, you re responsible for what you said, and you re responsible for owning up. And I don t care who your handlers are   grow up and say,  I m sorry. Joy Behar also summed up Trump s message.  The message is  don t vote for me,  she said.Here s the video via ABC.Donald Trump is not presidential material. He has no courage and zero moral fiber. He thinks he can say whatever he wants without consequence and while that may be the case on a reality show this is the political arena he is in now. Women represent more than half of the electorate, which makes pissing them off a very bad idea if the GOP hopes to stave off extinction. But his big mouth could have even more serious repercussions.If Trump pops off at the wrong time to the wrong people he could seriously affect our relations with other nations, especially nations with which we have serious tensions to work out. Trump s big mouth could easily sabotage crucial diplomatic negotiations or piss someone off enough to break ties with us. We need international cooperation now more than ever, especially if we hope to defeat ISIS.

By eliminating the estate tax, the plan would benefit Trump, his family, and other wealthy Americans. So, now we know why Trump was so vague during his short speech in Indiana on Wednesday.We re wondering what Mr. Fancy Pants thinks a new house costs. By the way, the estimated average transaction price of a new car or truck in 2015 was $33,560. We re sure that s higher now. Mr. Cohn was only off by $32,560. He was soooo close. Missed it by that much! The average cost to renovate a kitchen is actually $21,797.

"September 29, 2016","Mexico does not like Donald Trump, and for good reason. He s accused their people of being rapists and killers, said that the country is deliberately sending their trash up to us to deal with, and we all know about the wall he wants to force Mexico to pay for. One Mexican literary magazine, called Letras Libres, decided to illustrate what they think of Trump after all of this. Their October issue features him on the cover, and it s not in a flattering light:En nuestro n mero de octubre: pic.twitter.com/xhMFnU9ttR  Letras Libres (@Letras_Libres) September 28, 2016That  stache is reminiscent of Hitler s mustache and reads  fascista Americana,  or,  American fascist. Suffice it to say, the editors at Letras Libres aren t thrilled with Trump, either.One expert on the history of fascism said that Trump s nonstop, offensive ethnic stereotyping, and his fear-the-foreigners rhetoric are textbook fascism. Mexico is a foreign country. Their people are foreigners, and Trump likes to claim they re stealing our jobs, both inside and outside our borders. He hates them and he wants us to hate them.His ability to convince his loyal subjects that the country is in serious decline, when it isn t, is likewise textbook fascism. He s got the entire world worried, confused as to how he could even have gotten this far in a U.S. election cycle, and just generally pissed the hell off.One thing he did recently was complain that Mexico forces us to pay a tax to sell products there, but they can sell their products here without paying the same tax. Mexico has a value-added tax that American companies must pay when they sell products there, but Mexican companies have to pay that same tax to sell in their own country, even though they don t have to pay it here. Our companies don t pay it here either.Trump listed that as one of his millions of reasons that NAFTA is needs to be torn up. Trump doesn t know what he s talking about. But that is, in fact, just another claim that Mexico is stealing from us, and must be stopped.In other words, Letras Libres sees Trump for what he is. He may not quite be Hitler or Mussolini (yet, mostly because he s not in charge yet), but he s definitely got a very strong fascist streak.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images", Trump Will HATE This Mexican Magazine For Unmasking Him On Their Cover (IMAGE)
"September 29, 2017","Trump has spent an awful lot of time whining about Puerto Rico being an island with a devastated infrastructure, claiming that s the reason our relief effort has been so slow and disorganized: The response and recovery effort probably has never been seen for something like this. This is an island surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water. He also said: This is a thing called the Atlantic Ocean. This is tough stuff. Gee, these complaints are reminiscent of when he said nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated. With this administration,  It s really difficult, we re doing all we can,  is code for,  I don t really care about this at all unless I can find a way to make myself look good here. But are we really having problems because Puerto Rico is an island, making it different than Florida and Texas, which were also devastated by hurricanes? Current evidence suggests otherwise: Supplies are just sitting in shipping containers there because there are too few truck drives, and too many blocked roads. One has to wonder why we don t have more personnel there helping the Puerto Rican government to clear the roads so that supply lines can reopen and we can help get those supplies to where they re most needed. One person even said that the personnel who are there just seem to be modeling their uniforms. That suggests we have a lot of people who don t know what they re supposed to be doing on the ground there. That would be a failure on our part, not Puerto Rico s.But then there s how Obama handled natural disasters on islands. In 2010, Haiti, which is practically next door to Puerto Rico in the Caribbean (not the Atlantic Ocean), suffered an absolutely devastating earthquake. Despite the fact that we had no warning for that quake (we had plenty of warning for Maria), President Obama mobilized our military  as if it were going to war,  according to the Washington Post. Within two days, we had 8,000 troops on their way to the disaster-stricken country.In less than two weeks, we had 22,000 troops on the ground; 300 military helicopters dropping supplies, and 33 Navy ships aiding the relief effort. Eight days after Maria swept over Puerto Rico, we only had 4,400 troops working relief there, along with 1,000 members of the Coast Guard. Only 50 choppers were working to deliver supplies.The morning after Haiti s quake, Obama told the military that they were  going to respond in Port-au-Prince robustly and immediately, and that gave the whole government clarity of purpose.  Rajiv Shah, who led USAID when the earthquake struck, said: We were able to move more quickly in a foreign country, and with no warning because it was an earthquake, than a better-equipped agency was able to do in a domestic territory. The Posse Comitatus Act places limits on what the military can do in a state or territory, and by contrast, Haiti is a foreign country. Our military response would be considerably different just because of that. But there were over 17,000 troops from 23 states on the ground in Florida after Irma. And the administration keeps saying that Puerto Rico isn t asking for very much, despite residents running out of food, drinkable water and other supplies, and San Juan s mayor breaking down over the Trump administration saying the response has been good.There are complicating factors, it s true. But this is a level of apathy and ineptitude we can t have from the White House when responding to disasters, particularly those where people are dying. Obama showed that being an island is a lot less of a factor in relief efforts than this administration is claiming.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Mark Wilson/Getty Images"," Trump Is Too Incompetent To Handle Disaster On An Island, But Obama Handled One Just Fine"
"September 3, 2016","In a speech to the American Legion, the largest veteran organization in the country, Donald Trump alarmingly went full fascist when he promised to  promote pride and patriotism in American schools.  When you add that to his attacks on the press, support of nationalists, quoting of dictators, and lack of support for the freedom of speech, the picture that is painted is very clear.The troubling remarks began early in his speech: I want to begin by discussing one goal that I know is so important to all of you: promoting American pride and patriotism in America s schools.In A Trump Administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America s children. We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America s history, its institutions, and its heroes.We will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America.We will be united by our common culture, values and principles   becoming One American Nation. And if you re one of many parents who have trouble with children mindlessly repeating the pledge of allegiance   many of whom don t know what the words  pledge  and  allegiance  mean   he s got bad news for you, specifically: That flag deserves respect, and I will work with American Legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag   and, by the way, we want young Americans to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. In other words, Trump wants right-wing nationalist propaganda in public schools. That s probably because Republicans have a serious problem with history, and an even bigger problem with teaching it to kids. After all, they might learn that the United States is not inherently morally superior and beyond reproach by definition! That s why in 2014, House Republicans actually expressed their displeasure with, you know, facts, and passed a resolution saying they don t approve of high school AP History. Seriously.The following Al Franken quote comes to mind: You have to love your country like an adult loves somebody, not like a child loves its mommy. And right-wing Republicans tend to love America like a child loves its mommy, where everything Mommy does is okay. But adult love means you re not in denial, and you want the loved one to be the best they can be. That s not the only reason Trump s idea is a bad one. It s also illegal. As Military Times points out:Public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money. Most schools receive little federal funding.Current federal law prohibits the federal government from exercising  any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system.

"September 3, 2017","We always knew that Donald Trump was a heartless bastard. However, he just decided to leave no doubt about that fact in the minds of the American people, as the orange one has decided to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which is an Obama-era program that protects children who arrived in the United States illegally when they were very young from deportation. The announcement came late Sunday night, as millions of people waited anxiously to see what the fate of their family members and friends   and for DACA recipients, themselves   would be.According to Politico, Trump will phase the program out within six months, leaving 800,000 DACA recipients subject to immediate deportation. It seems that the six month waiting period to start deporting DACA recipients, also known as DREAMERS, is to give Congress time to solve the problem of undocumented children themselves. The argument seems to be that a lot of people in Trump s orbit believe that immigration policies like DACA are the job of lawmakers, not the president, and therefore President Obama had no right to do what he did for the DREAMERS.This all comes as many lawmakers   including many Republicans   have said that Trump should leave the DACA kids alone. After all, these are people who know no other home, who came here as very small children and are Americans in every way except on paper. They literally have nowhere to go if Trump and his goons deport them.Now, it should be noted that this is not an official announcement and that it came from White House sources with knowledge of the upcoming announcement who spoke to Politico reporters. Since Trump is impulsive and unpredictable, there is still time for all of this to change. Hopefully, Congress will do something during the six-month window, rendering this awful decision moot.Anyone who thought this administration wouldn t be on a mission to destroy the lives of millions of people was completely deluded. We now see that Team Trump is on their way to making America into their fever dream of a white ethnostate   or as close to it as they can come. That s what you get when dumb people decide it would be a great idea to have a racist run the country.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter"," Despicable Trump Announces An End To DACA, Will Kick 800,000 Kids Out"

"September 30, 2017","During a time of national crisis, most presidents focus on helping people in need. But not Donald Trump. Instead, he is sending out mass text messages to stroke his own ego and try to raise money. He keeps telling his fans that if they don t keep donating, their big election upset will all be for naught. Here are the texts he sent to his most ardent fans (and a few people who just subscribe for the lulz):Now, to put this into context, the people of Puerto Rico are literally dying. Trump has, instead of trying to help them, attacked the mayor of San Juan on Twitter for begging for help to save the lives of the Americans who live there, and his disaster response has been abysmal, because, you know, brown people. And now, he sends out lying mass communications pretending that he has helped people and delivered on promises when he has done no such thing. Hell, there is plenty of evidence that there was even a point in time when Trump didn t even realize that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens.In short, this is a man who is raising money off the backs of suffering and dying people, and using the protests of NFL players who want to use their platforms to shine a light on the injustices suffered at the hands of law enforcement by people of color to stoke racial divisions in the nation. In fact, there is even evidence that this part of it was planned.

It s a real d*ck move that is so appalling even Republicans are calling him out on it. Approximately 800,000 young people will be subject to immediate deportation, and that would have included Alonso Guillen, a 31-year-old disc jockey from Lufkin, Texas who gave his life while trying to rescue others in the state in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.On Wednesday, Guillen disappeared along with two of his friends after their boat hit the bridge over the creek and capsized, the Houston Chronicle reports.One of his friends clung to a tree and was eventually rescued but days later, Guillen and Tomas Carreon Jr. were still missing. Carreon s body was found floating down the creek on Friday.On Sunday, Guillen s body was found as it floated past a sandy berm. A relative quickly dove in and pulled his body to the shoulder of the creek. Soon after, a boat took him to shore.The Houston Chronicle reports:Guillen s father, Jesus Guillen, said he d asked his son not to try and rescue people in the storm, but he insisted, saying he wanted to help people. He cried and prayed on Sunday afternoon as they pulled his son s body from the water. Thank you, God,  he said,  for the time I had with him. Trump would have had Mr. Guillen deported and now Border agents are refusing to let his mother into the U.S. in order to bury her son.Guillen was a recipient of the DACA program and his father is here legally but his mother, Rita Ruiz de Guillen, 62, is still in the application process for legal status.Mrs. Guillen said from her home in Rita Ruiz, Mexico, across the border from Eagle Pass, that she s asking God for strength. I ve lost a great son, you have no idea,  she said while weeping softly on the other end of the phone.  I m asking God to give me strength. She explained that she had hoped that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials would take pity and grant her a humanitarian visa so that she could go to Houston and bury her son, but she was turned back at the border.

"September 5, 2016","For a long time now, the mainstream media has avoided questioning Donald Trump about the questionable relationship between a donation he made to the Attorney General in Florida and her decision to give his allegedly fraudulent Trump University a pass. After progressives complained about the issue on social media, the press has finally begun asking Trump about the details of his gift to Pam Bondi, which was recently flagged as a violation of the law by the IRS, resulting in a fine.Asked about the cash gift and the later favor delivered by Bondi, Trump immediately got caught in an inconvenient lie. I never spoke to her, first of all. She s a fine person, beyond reproach. I never even spoke to her about it at all. She s a fine person. Never spoken to her about it, never,  Trump said Monday while campaigning in Ohio.  Many of the attorney generals turned that case down because I ll win that case in court. Many turned that down.

Reichelderfer said that Bondi had not been aware of the complaints against Trump University when she asked for the contribution.Trump doesn t have to have spoken with Bondi about his donation to her for it to be clear evidence of a  pay for play  scandal, but it is telling that as usual his first, off the cuff remark about Bondi turns out to have been false.Trump also made a donation to the attorney general in Texas, who then dropped a probe of Trump University, and it is unknown how many other government officials got nice checks from Trump before they made decisions about his business interests.But we do know that his first instinct was to tell an easily provable lie.Featured image via YouTube"," Finally Asked About Bribery Scandal, Trump Immediately Gets Caught In A Lie"
"September 5, 2017","It s certainly no secret that Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, a man named after both the president of the Confederacy and the guy who actually started the Civil War, is an unholy racist. Like, he s so racist that the wife of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., actually delivered a letter to Congress pleading with them not to confirm him as a U.S. attorney 31 years ago.So it s no surprise to find out that Sessions was the driving force behind convincing Donald Trump to end DACA, the temporary deferment program for undocumented immigrants that protects them from deportation if they came here as children. Sessions sees no difference between an  illegal alien  who steals a car and one who may sit next to one of his 10 grandchildren in school one day.So imbued with the essence of Jeff Sessions was the Trump decision to boot nearly a million kids out of the country in less than a year s time that it was the AG himself who delivered the speech announcing it. And it was during that speech on Tuesday that the former senator from Alabama revealed the truth behind the decision to end DACA: That despite the fact that even many Republicans favor the basic protections that DACA affords, it is racism that serves as the foundation for undoing it. From the speech: The effect of this unilateral executive amnesty, among other things, contributed to a surge of unaccompanied minors on the southern border that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences. It also denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens. This is a direct appeal to the racist tendencies of the Americans who put Donald Trump in office.Number one, the  surge of unaccompanied minors  that Sessions refers to began well before DACA was implemented. To suggest otherwise is a dog whistle to right-wing voters. A BBC report from 2012 showed that the number of unaccompanied minors who were apprehended near the border increased from October 2011 to March 2012 by 93% over the same period in the previous year. DACA was not implemented until June of 2012. Besides that, any who came after DACA was announced wouldn t have qualified in the first place. You had to have been in the United States at the time of implementation to benefit from the executive order.Number two, Sessions brings up the myth of the job-stealing immigrant. The theory, again an appeal to racists, is ridiculous from the start. Immigrants don t even look for the same jobs as native citizens. There is no evidence to support the claim that DACA has had any effect on jobs   other than as a boost to our economy. In fact, with the job losses that will come as DACA expires   something to the tune of 30,000 workers a month   employers stand to lose billions in training new employees, and the federal government will lose tens of billions in lost revenue and GDP.But those facts don t jibe with the Sessions narrative.Don t let the mini-quarrel that Trump and Sessions got into earlier this year fool you. They both have a racist agenda, and this is the first major step in implementing it.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images"," AG Sessions Persuaded Trump To End DACA, Then Race-Baited His Way Through The Speech That Killed It"

"September 6, 2017","As we saw with his Muslim travel ban as well as his attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, every time Donald Trump puts forth one of his disastrous ideas, it blows up in his face and delivers a devastating blow to his already failing presidency.Each time Trump introduces an unpopular policy or idea, his already historically low approval rating takes another nosedive. This week, Trump only managed to make things worse for himself when he decided to end former President Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. Here s the problem   most Americans disagree with him.According to a recent survey from Morning Consult/Politico, almost 80% (76% to be exact) of Americans do not believe that Dreamers (the undocumented immigrants that were brought into the United States illegally as kids) should be forced to return to their countries. The majority of Americans are far more humane than Trump, and believe that these immigrants should have the opportunity to become citizens, as most have been productive members and have contributed greatly to American society.Trump is especially in trouble because his decision to end DACA only offers more proof that he is a racist a**hole. As MSNBC s Joy Reid perfectly pointed out, there is  no economic, national security or social cohesion rationale  for ending DACA: Trump might say that he has  great love  for the immigrants that are living in America, but his decision proves the exact opposite. Trump wants to strip Dreamers of the lives and progress they have made for themselves in this country and force them to return to countries they are unfamiliar with, where they will have nothing.With this decision, Trump is not only screwing himself over by killing his presidency, but he is also basically putting the GOP in great danger in future elections by excluding one of the fastest-growing voting demographics. Trump is sinking the Republican Party   and his presidency   at record speed.Featured image via video screen capture ", Trump Humiliated As DACA Decision Practically Kills His Presidency (DETAILS)
"September 7, 2016","If there s one thing strong, successful women love to hear from men who are jealous of their success, it s how they should behave. With that previous sentence being clearly sarcasm if you possess a brain, it needs to be noted that s what RNC Chair Reince Priebus just did to Hillary Clinton while watching NBC s latest presidential forum discussing veterans and military issues.Priebus thought it wise to write: Hillary Clinton was angry and defensive the entire time   no smile and uncomfortable   upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets. @HillaryClinton was angry + defensive the entire time   no smile and uncomfortable   upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets.  Reince Priebus (@Reince) September 8, 2016Didn t you know that if you re to be taken seriously as a woman you need to be smiling at all times and look appealing? God forbid you have a face that reads you re taking Veteran issues very seriously and want to make sure they re given the respect and dignity they so rightfully deserve.This is yet just another example of a brutal double standard that still exists not only within modern politics but among the workplace in general.Donald Trump sat there during the entire forum without a smile on his face while discussing Veteran issues with NBC s Matt Lauer, but no one spoke of his lack of facial expression. Why? Because it s not expected of men. Women, on the other hand, are held to a different standard where they need to appear appealing at all times.It s bullshit is what it is.Let s stick to the issues, Priebus.Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images"," Reince Priebus Mansplained Hillary’s Behavior During Forum, And It’s REPULSIVE (TWEET)"
"September 7, 2017","Donald Trump, Jr. went before Congress today to give yet another version of his reasons for meeting with a Russian lawyer in June of 2016. While he did actually confirm what he said in the email string he was dumb enough to post to Twitter that he met with Natalia Veselnitskaya because she claimed to have dirt on Hillary he gave a ridiculous reason for it. His reason was that he was trying to determine Hillary s fitness for office, because that s a totally innocent reason that makes it all okay.So that makes it all innocent, especially because he also claimed that he was just so overwhelmed with the campaign due to inexperience, but he did still evidently have the presence of mind to know he should talk to legal counsel about the propriety of the meeting and info, or so his claim goes.Some, however, on the Senate Judiciary Committee don t believe him, it seems. Sen. Chris Coons, who sits on that committee, sent out a memo to  interested parties  about Don the Con Jr. and his testimony today, complete with the statute regarding giving false testimony to Congress. And there s no ambiguity about it   the top of the memo says: Below is a statute to keep in mind in regards to Donald Trump Jr. s testimony today. It quotes the full statute, which states that it s illegal to lie to Congress, and then Coons says: It is important to remember that anyone who testifies in front of a Senate committee is under the restrictions of the False Statements statute that says material false statements to Congress are criminal and punishable with fines or imprisonment or both. Read Coons  full memo below:? After Don Jr. testimony to Senate Judiciary Cmte, Sen. Chris Coons  office sends out statute on giving false statements to Congress pic.twitter.com/OUdKXMBfqm  Andrew Desiderio (@desiderioDC) September 7, 2017The many contradictions in Don Jr. s reasons for meeting with Veselnitskaya clearly raise doubts that his testimony today was the truth. He first claimed, months ago, that he didn t meet with any Russians, and then later claimed that meant he didn t meet with any known Russian officials. Then he claimed that he did meet with a Russian attorney, but it was about adoptions. After that, he said he did meet with her, but it was because he was told she had dirt on Hillary. He said the meeting was a fruitless endeavor.Now he says it s because he wanted to determine her fitness for the presidency, which he seems to think makes it all okay. Coons is right to be skeptical. It would be one thing if the junior Trump s story had never changed, and contradicting information had never come out. But it s impossible to trust the testimony of someone who s changed their story as many times as he has.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images", Don Trump Jr. Testified To The Senate Today And They Don’t Seem To Believe A Word He Said
"September 8, 2016","Hillary Clinton is far from the perfect politician. She sometimes comes across as cold, as unemotional. She, unlike her opponent, though, is perfectly aware of her flaws and in a deeply moving op-ed in the Humans of New York blog, Clinton opens up about her flaws and about being a woman in what s still a man s world.If anyone is demonstrating the double standard between women and men, it s Clinton s opponent, Donald Trump, who just this week said that Clinton doesn t have  a presidential look.  Yeah, we know what that means. Or how about the people who are criticizing Clinton for not smiling enough? Could you imagine that happening with a man?By this time, Clinton is used to the double standard, but it does make it tougher for the most qualified presidential candidate in decades to compete. In the article in Humans of New York, Clinton talked about her history and about how hard she works at not appearing too feminine.She relayed a story about law school, and how hard she worked to learn to control her emotions. She also recognizes that she comes across as cold and unemotional because of that. I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions. And that s a hard path to walk. Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don t want to seem  walled off.  And sometimes I think I come across more in the  walled off  arena. And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility. I don t view myself as cold or unemotional. And neither do my friends. And neither does my family. But if that sometimes is the perception I create, then I can t blame people for thinking that. As for the inevitable comparisons with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, well, she knows she doesn t have their charisma. She also sees how hard they work on it. I m not Barack Obama. I m not Bill Clinton. Both of them carry themselves with a naturalness that is very appealing to audiences. But I m married to one and I ve worked for the other, so I know how hard they work at being natural. It s not something they just dial in. They work and they practice what they re going to say. It s not that they re trying to be somebody else. But it s hard work to present yourself in the best possible way. She also notes that there are very few role models for women in politics and that Obama s and her husband s type of charisma doesn t work for women.It s a double-edged sword. Clinton is accused of being stiff, but if she s animated, things get even worse. But I ve learned that I can t be quite so passionate in my presentation. I love to wave my arms, but apparently that s a little bit scary to people. And I can t yell too much. It comes across as  too loud  or  too shrill  or  too this  or  too that.  Which is funny, because I m always convinced that the people in the front row are loving it. If Clinton wins, some of these double standards might start drifting away, but it s still a misogynistic world. A woman president won t solve misogyny any more than an African-American president solved racism. It s a societal problem, but for those who don t consider themselves sexist, perhaps it s time to take a good hard look at your criticisms of Clinton. Would the criticisms be the same if she was a man?Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"," In Brilliant Op-Ed, Hillary Clinton Opens Up About Her Flaws"
"September 8, 2017","Fox News has a problem with sexual predators in its ranks. Their gross corporate rape culture is costing them television personalities left and right. First, it was the now-deceased mastermind behind the network, Roger Ailes. Then it was Bill O Reilly (who was, by all accounts, their main star) who had to be canned to save the network s brand after millions were paid to his victims. Now, it is happening again   only this time it is Eric Bolling.Bolling had his own program, called The Specialists, which was relatively new, but he had been with the network for a decade. Fox News released a curt statement that read: Fox News Channel is canceling The Specialists, and Eric Bolling and Fox have agreed to part ways amicably. We thank Eric for his ten years of service to our loyal viewers and wish him the best of luck. There was no mention of the sexual harassment charges, but that was clearly the reason. Bolling has been accused of sending lewd photos of penises to female Fox News employees. Bolling, for his part, is, of course, denying the allegations. His lawyer released a statement that reads: Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made. This all comes on the heels of Bolling being suspended after Yashar Ali of the Huffington Post came out with an explosive report regarding Bolling s conduct in the workplace. Bolling is filing a $50 million lawsuit against Yashar for character defamation. It likely won t go anywhere as no one in their right mind would write such a story without concrete evidence.That network of right-wing propaganda needs to go down the toilet with the rest of the sewage. They are misogynistic, racist, and all around bigoted to their core. They are also pathological liars who should not be allowed to call themselves  news. So long, Bolling. Hopefully the rest of that vile network follows.Featured image via Logopedia", Another Pervert Out At Fox News Over Allegations Of Sexual Harassment
"September 9, 2016","Donald Trump is continuing his campaign of fear-mongering, this time insisting that the 2016 election will be the last actual election unless Americans put him in the White House. Appearing for an interview on the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump told host David Brody that Republicans will never have a chance at the White House again because you re going to have illegal immigrants coming in and they re going to be legalized and they re going to be able to vote and once that all happens you can forget it. So, in other words, Trump is once again blaming immigrants for all of the Republican Party s problems. The thing is, though, the GOP s issues are of their own making. They are on the wrong side of history on issues of race, women s issues, their fervent bigotry against the LGBTQ community, their denial of science, and any other number of issues. In other words, until they stop being the party of bigotry, they will never appeal to anyone but bigots, and there just aren t enough of them left in the general electorate for a majority to want to put an obvious racist in the White House. Here is the transcript of that exchange, via Right Wing Watch:Trump: I think it s going to be the last election that the Republicans can win. If we don t win this election, you ll never see another Republican and you ll have a whole different church structure. You re going to have a whole different Supreme Court structure. That has to do a lot with what we re doing because the Supreme Court, as you know with Justice Scalia gone, I think you could probably have four to five judges picked by the next president. Probably a record number, David, probably a record number of judges. If they pick the super-liberals, probably to a certain extent, people that would make Bernie Sanders happy, you will never have a Supreme Court, we re going to end up with another Venezuela, large scale version. It would be a disaster for the country.Brody: Just so I understand, when you say last election are you referring to what Michele Bachmann was talking about with citizenship because Hillary is talking about potentially providing citizenship for many of these illegals. Florida and Texas could be gone.Trump: I think this will be the last election if I don t win. I think this will be the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning because you re going to have people flowing across the borders, you re going to have illegal immigrants coming in and they re going to be legalized and they re going to be able to vote and once that all happens you can forget it. I guarantee you, you re not going to have one Republican vote. And it s already a very hard number. Already the path is much more difficult for the Republicans. You just have to look at the maps and the path is much more difficult.And here is the video:The thing is, Republicans have no one to thank for the mass defection from their party but themselves. They ve trafficked in hate, conspiracy theories, science denial, and theocratic bigotry for decades. Donald Trump is the natural result of cultivating those sorts of uninformed, ignorant voters   the voters that make up their base that they have to pander to. But, of course, they ll never admit it, and their hateful, archaic party will go into the ash heap of history and into irrelevancy at the national level where it belongs.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images", Trump Gives Insane Warning On Religious Right Network To Scare People Into Voting For Him (VIDEO)
"September 9, 2017","Two Florida Republican lawmakers voted against a $15 billion hurricane relief bill just as Irma churned toward the state. Congressmen Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and Ted Yoho (R-FL) claim they have concerns about other provisions of the measure. Irma is now a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph but forecasters expect the storm to strengthen. Presently, the Florida Keys is facing a potentially catastrophic force that could threaten to drown entire islands.But, it s obviously more important for Gaetz and Yoho to exercise their conservative bonafides.The relief package sailed through the Senate and the House and was signed by Donald Trump on Friday. The package boosts funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a necessary move at this time following the destruction left by Hurricane Harvey and much more expected after Florida feels Irma s force and fury. Also, FEMA is running out of money so the funds are needed.The package will also raise the debt ceiling for three months and includes a short-term budget that would keep the government running until December. The deal struck between Trump and Democratic leaders Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) sent Republicans into a panic while disregarding that lives are at stake after the deadly storm obliterated Houston, Texas.The Washington Post reports:That latter was a problem for GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz and Ted Yoho, who stuck to their principles of fiscal conservatism despite calls from fellow Florida lawmakers to support the bill. The two, who are among the 90 House Republicans who voted against the bill, do not represent parts of the state that are likely to feel Irma s immediate impact as the massive storm makes landfall on mainland United States this weekend. Snaking in a debt-ceiling increase with funding for victims and communities affected is immoral and reflective of broken leadership in Washington,  Yoho said after the vote Friday.  I do not think it wise to extend our borrowing limit without mandatory spending reforms . . . If this was a clean measure that focused on those affected by Hurricane Harvey, I would have proudly voted for it. Gaetz, whose district includes coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico, said the debt limit should be raised only if it includes cuts in entitlement programs, which is really heartless since many victims of the Hurricanes will need a hand up after losing everything they owned in the world. I have a pretty strident view that I will only vote to raise the debt limit if that vote is accompanied by reductions in entitlement spending,  Gaetz said.  If conservatives don t start voting no against debt-limit increases, all the FEMA in the world won t save us from our most unfortunate destiny. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was against federal aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy, then a natural disaster struck his state with deadly force. Suddenly, he s cool with aid being provided to his state. Funny how that works. But the other two Republicans just don t want to help anyone, even their own constituents.Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images.", Two Florida Lawmakers Just Voted Against Hurricane Relief As Irma Strikes Their State

"Apr 1, 2015","This woman s having trouble entering the Walmart so people go to help her SHE SPITS ON THEM! Her reasoning for this disgusting behavior is that  Americans are pushing us around . She s arrested BUT what happens next is what s so disturbing.A Saudi Arabian national faces hate crimes charges after allegedly spitting on several people at a Florida Walmart.Nuha Mohammed Al-Doaifi was arrested in Palm Bay after police responded to a 911 call, Florida Today reported Tuesday.The 21-year-old, who was with her 2-year-old son at the time, allegedly admitted to authorities she spat on several people because  Americans are pushing us around. The incident began, police said, when a woman approached Al-Doaifi when she appeared to be having difficulty entering the Walmart. All I was trying to do was tell her she was coming in through the out door,  Terry Rakowski told Florida Today.  She was just ramming (her cart) into the door. The 39-year-old then claims the woman spat in her face. She just spit all over me,  she said.Al-Doaifi then allegedly did the same thing to several others inside the Walmart. Her actions were directed at random people based on their ethnicity, and that s according to her own statement,  said a spokeswoman for the Palm Bay Police Department.BUT THIS IS WHAT S EVEN MORE DISTURBING:Don t bother trying to hit the link to the original source  Florida Today . As soon as this story started to appear at other websites they yanked the story, scrubbed it completely. You can t even find the original report by searching for this woman s name, all you get is a 404  page not found. It s like it never happened and she doesn t exist.Apparently, hate crimes is a one way street, especially when committed by a Muslim against white folks.You have to wonder why she s even here if she hates white Americans so much. The next question is whether the Obama regime will deport her back to the big sandbox from whence she came.I m gonna say, probably not.VIA: BLUR BRAIN",MUSLIM WOMAN ARRESTED FOR SPITTING ON HER FELLOW WHITE WALMART SHOPPERS BUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS MORE UPSETTING

"Apr 1, 2017","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPqQIlWksbgVermont Sen. Bernard Sanders told CNN Thursday that President Trump s plan to prioritize job creation over climate change regulations is  stupid and dangerous.  The commander in chief signed an  Energy Independence  executive order Tuesday as a means of rolling back former President Barack Obama s Clean Power Plan. Mr. Trump said his policies will cause  wealth to pour into our communities,  although Mr. Sanders frames it as a recipe for environmental disaster.  [This plan is a] nonsensical, and stupid, and dangerous approach,  Mr. Sanders told CNN s Wolf Blitzer Thursday.  It s almost indescribable. Look, the scientific community is virtually unanimous. While Trump and his friends think climate change is a hoax, what the scientists are telling us it is real, it is caused by human activity. It is already causing devastating problems.  The Trump administration argues on the White House website that its actions will prevent $39 billion in electricity hikes, allow 242 million tons of coal to benefit the American economy, and disbands the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases.  I am taking historic steps to lift restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion and to cancel job-killing regulations,  Mr. Trump said Tuesday while surrounded by coal industry executives. Kentucky Coal Association President Tyler White cheered the move soon afterward.Read more: WT",BONKERS BERNIE SANDERS: Prioritizing Jobs Over Climate Change Is ‘Stupid and Dangerous’ [Video]
"Apr 10, 2015","Where was the media coverage when this black thug shot a white police officer in the face? It clearly doesn t fit their narrative which explains why this horrific incident took place on March 27, 2015 and the video is just being released today Massachusetts officials on Friday released video footage showing the near-fatal shooting of a Boston police officer last month by a man who was subsequently shot dead by other officers.The decision to release the footage comes amid protests in several major U.S. cities over a series of killings of civilians in recent months. The latest occurred last Saturday when a white officer in South Carolina was videotaped shooting an unarmed black man as he fled after a traffic stop. It is in everyone s best interest to share (this) information as soon as possible in order to tamp down speculation and rumors meant to inflame and not inform,  Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said at a news conference.The video shows six-year Boston Police Department veteran John Moynihan and two colleagues approaching a car stopped at about 6:40 p.m. on March 27 in Boston s Roxbury neighborhood.As Moynihan stands near the driver s door, a man identified by police as 41-year-old Angelo West jumps out of the vehicle, shoots Moynihan in the face and runs out of the camera frame as Moynihan falls to the ground.Authorities say West, who had a criminal record including prior gun charges, was shooting at police as he ran and that Moynihan s fellow officers returned fire, killing him.Moynihan, 34, is recovering after surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his neck.Local leaders at the news conference said that anger toward police over the incident was minimal. We need to be very aware that the work of police officers is indeed very dangerous,  said Rev. Mark Scott, of the Azusa Christian Community in Boston s Dorchester neighborhood.He called West s death  tragic,  but added that once someone pulls a gun on a police officer,  you don t leave the police any other option but to respond. The Suffolk District Attorney s office is investigating the shootings and has said it will release a full report on the incident later.Via: Reuters",BREAKING: WHY DID MASSACHUSETTS OFFICIALS WAIT SO LONG To Release This Video Showing Thug Shooting Police Officer In Face?

The people at the fundraiser had to pay a whopping $27,000 to hear this top secret info that the regular folk like you and me don t get to hear. Aaaahhhh, a woman of the people who s just like us Hillary Clinton s campaign team reportedly used a static noise machine on Thursday to block reporters outside of a fundraiser in Denver from hearing her remarks.That s according to Stan Bush, a reporter for Denver s CBS-4, who was stationed outside of the event, which was held outdoors at the home of Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a superdelegate who has endorsed Clinton.Bush said that the noise interference machine was turned on after a band   later identified as Big Head Todd and the Monsters   finished playing music and before Clinton spoke. The device was placed inside of a fence on the property and aimed in the direction of the press, Bush wrote. He posted video showing what it sounded like outside of the event before and after the machine was turned on. The device produced a low-intensity throbbing noise, much like a helicopter off in the distance.Read more: Daily Caller",HILLARY Uses A Noise Machine To Keep Us From Hearing Her Speech
"Apr 10, 2017","This is very curious! The AP is reporting a story from a  Senior U.S. Official  on Russia s involvement in the Syria gas attack. This official is saying that the we have evidence that Russia knew about the chemical weapon attack before it happened. This Associated Press report is interesting for a couple of reasons. Is the release of this information by a Senior U.S. Official an effort to embarrass Rex Tillerson or cause trouble for his trip to Russia?Tillerson will be in Russia in 36 hours so this will only add to the tension. Could this actually be the strategy of the Trump administration to give the upper hand to the U.S.?WASHINGTON (AP)   A senior U.S. official says the United States has concluded that Russia knew in advance of Syria s chemical weapons attack last week.The official says a Russian-operated drone flew over a hospital in Syria as victims of the attack were rushing to get treatment.Hours after the drone left, a Russian-made fighter jet bombed the hospital in what American officials believe was an attempt to cover up the usage of chemical weapons.Until Monday, U.S. officials had said they weren t sure if the drone was operated by Russia or Syria. The senior official said it still wasn t clear who was flying the jet that bombed the hospital.The official said the presence of the drone couldn t have been a coincidence, and that Russia must have known the chemical weapons attack was coming and that victims were seeking treatment.The official wasn t authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity.

"Apr 11, 2015","It s so refreshing to see these GOP candidates who are unwilling to allow the left to misrepresent their beliefs and create a distorted view of their positions on social issues.Having identified what they perceive as his Achilles heel, the liberal media continues to go at potential Republican presidential contender Ben Carson over gay issues.But Carson is clearly learning.The latest attempt at  gotcha jornalism  took place early Thursday when the retired neurosurgeon sat down with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who started off lecturing Carson about not being able to  duck issues  as president. As president of the United States, do you understand that you wouldn t be able to duck issues just because they make you uncomfortable or you don t do well on them?  Cuomo asked.  You understand that?(Gone are the days when such a condescending question would have resulted in a widespread media outcry of racism   after all, Carson is a Republican.)Taking the question at face value and asking what issues Cuomo had in mind, Carson was hit with  gay issues,  which Cuomo called  a very important issue to the development of the American culture. https://youtu.be/GE0O5AwP97sCarson responded with understated class, noting sexuality is a personal issue that he didn t find it nearly as interesting as Cuomo, who then tried to swing the conversation to gay marriage. Carson countered to say he would like to see the rights of Christians receive the same intensity, which prompted an interesting exchange. I would like to see as much emphasis on the rights of Christians as there is to some of the other groups,  Carson said.  I would like to see a much greater conservation about Christians and their rights. Why are we not talking about that? We are right now,  Cuomo replied.  The LGBT community gets far less legal protection, as you know No, not as I know,  Carson interjected. How do you not know that?  Cuomo asked.Carson then hit home on the crux of what defines the Democratic Party   identity politics. The important thing is for us as a nation to recognize that all citizens of the United States are protected by our Constitution,  he said.  We need to stop deciding that one group versus another is the flavor of the day.

"Apr 11, 2016","Has their ever been a more vengeful and hateful First Lady?They are the elite group of women who occupy the East Wing of the White House as their husbands serve as presidents of the United States.Viewed as  the true modern power brokers of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , the first ladies have had different takes on their public positions and either love the proximity to the country s top policy advisers or view it as serving a prison term of teas, luncheons, dinners and photo ops.There are friendships among this sorority of first ladies and turbulent rivalries as well as  relationships fraught with hurt feelings and resentment, like that between Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama , Kate Andersen Brower writes in her new book, First Women, the Grace and Power of America s Modern First Ladies, published by Harper. The 2008 presidential campaign left deep and lasting scars on both the Clinton and the Obama camps, and they are still shockingly fresh. Michelle, now 52, never forgot how Hillary mocked her husband s message of  hope and change  at a campaign rally in Ohio during that campaign. The sky will open, the light will come down, celestial choirs will be singing, and everyone will know that we should do the right thing, and the world would be perfect,  Clinton said.Watch Hillary starting at the 45 second mark:Hillary was right; that certainly didn t happen and she has remained bitter for years that Senator Ted Kennedy, who had been her mentor in the Senate, did not support her presidential candidacy in 2008.A source in Hillary s inner circle told the author that Hillary, now 68, is running again for president out of vengeance for that loss. She needs to win.Obama is viewed by Hillary s circle of people as not having the same work ethic as Hillary who they see as having a long record of dedicated public service.Those Clinton acolytes also suggest that  Michelle has not done enough as first lady  and has failed to prioritize funding for some programs that subsequently lost their federal support.One such program was Save America s Treasures, a program that Hillary started to help preserve and protect historic sites, arts and published works and was lovingly carried on by Laura Bush, the next first lady.Michelle felt no such obligation to those treasures and let the program dissolve.Michelle s feelings towards Hillary were blatantly obvious when no couple dinners were scheduled at the Obama White House while Hillary was secretary of state and frequently meeting with the President.Michelle is very close to Jill Biden and Vice President Joe Biden. She was hoping that Biden would run against Hillary for the Democratic nomination and his win would take away the sweet taste of victory once again for Hillary.

Who would pay a penny to hear this commie speak?A college in her hometown would pay this except they re going broke!That s a whopper of a bill for a university in her hometown that s going broke. There was an outcry when is was discovered that she would speak and charge $30K. Someone came forward to donate the fee but wouldn t it have been a great move on her part to donate the money to the failing university?Valerie Jarrett found herself in hot water in her adopted hometown for agreeing to take a $30,000 speaking fee from a public university that s going broke, a new report said Tuesday.President Obama s longtime adviser and confidante eventually waived the fee for delivering a commencement address at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago after an outcry over the hefty payment, Politico reported.The university shut down over spring break and also announced unpaid furlough days for staffers, the most recent in a string of measures taken to fight financial woes caused by a lengthy partisan state budget debate.The Chicago Sun-Times first reported the details in Jarrett s contract, and that a private donor agreed to pay her fee once university leaders raised objections. While keenly aware of the financial challenges in Illinois, we were not aware of the specific issues facing Northeastern Illinois University or that a donor would be paying for the speaking fee,  Amy Brundage, a Jarrett spokeswoman, told Politico. Jarrett notified [University] President [Richard] Helldobler this morning that she will not be accepting a speaking fee for the commencement address. Jarrett looks forward to addressing the graduates and other members of the NEIU community next month.

"Apr 12, 2015","You won t believe this judge and how he berates a family that was terrorized in a home invasion. Can a three-year old help how she feels after this traumatic event?The reason Judge Olu Stevens of Louisville, Kentucky berated a family that was terrorized by two black home invaders   in court and on Facebook   will knock your socks off. In all my years, I don t think I ve ever seen such an egregious example of race-card abuse.The judge was  troubled  and  offended  by the fact that a three year victim was so traumatized by a violent home invasion, she is now fearful of black males.Jordan and Tommy Gray s 3-year old daughter was watching  SpongeBob  when two black armed men broke into her home and robbed her family at gunpoint   one of the perps pointing a gun in her father s face.Mom and dad honestly noted on the their victim impact statement that she is still afraid of black men 2 years later. Whenever we are running errands, if we come across a black male, she holds me tight and begs me to leave,  the mother said.  It has affected her friendships at school and our relationships with African-American friends. Tommy Gray also wrote that since the crime, his daughter had been terrified of black males and that probation was not sufficient punishment for Gregory Wallace, 27, who had pleaded guilty to robbery. If holding a little girl at gunpoint gets you probation, then our system is flawed,  Gray said.But when Wallace was brought up for sentencing Feb. 4 in Jefferson Circuit Court, it was the parents, not Wallace, who suffered Judge Olu Stevens  wrath. I am offended.   I am deeply offended that they would be victimized by an individual and express some kind of fear of all black men,  he said. This little girl certainly has been victimized, and she can t help the way she feels,  he said.  My exception is more with her parents and their accepting that kind of mentality and fostering those type of stereotypes. The Grays were not in court as Stevens denounced their statements and granted probation to Wallace, whom he said deserved the opportunity to redeem himself.But they did see when Stevens condemned their statements again, in a post on Facebook. Do three year olds form such generalized, stereotyped and racist opinions of others?  he wrote.  I think not. Perhaps the mother had attributed her own views to her child as a manner of sanitizing them. That a supposedly unbiased judge would ask such an ridiculously biased  leading question  does not speak well of him.It s obviously true that three year olds generally don t develop  generalized, stereotyped and racist opinions (as if you could call her fears those things)  on their own.  This young tot had a little help   She was traumatized when a couple of black home invaders terrorized her family. Is this judge stupid?The family is obviously unhappy that the ordeal has negatively impacted their daughter s view of blacks. How did he miss that? It s why they listed it it on the impact statement.Later Stevens said,  I wasn t criticizing the victims, I was criticizing a statement that I thought was a generalization against an entire race of people. He was criticizing the feelings of a three year old victim of a crime. Shame on him. #SMDHMeanwhile    Wallace and his accomplice, Marquis McAfee, both 27, were arrested about three weeks after the robbery. Both pleaded guilty and McAfee, who was on probation for a prior crime, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which he is serving.Assistant Commonwealth s Attorney Richard Elder objected to probation for Wallace, who pleaded guilty to a 20-year sentence, saying he was  guilty as hell  and  put a gun in that little girl s father s face.

"Apr 14, 2015","Who needs family when you have a neighborhood mentor who can teach you the value of racism, communism and hate for America?In his 1995 book, Dreams from My Father, Barack Obama never discussed the identity of the mysterious  Frank  who had given him important advice on growing up black in what was described as a white racist world. We learned in 2008 that  Frank  was Frank Marshall Davis, a member of the Communist Party who was the subject of a 600-page FBI file. Still, the major media never asked Obama about this important relationship during his growing up years in Hawaii.Now, in an extraordinary development, video of Obama explicitly and openly identifying  Frank  as Frank Marshall Davis has suddenly surfaced on the Internet. The footage is said to have been recorded on September 20, 1995, with the program originally airing on Channel 37 Cambridge Municipal Television as an episode of the show,  The Author Series. It s not clear how many saw this program when it aired. For some reason, this  From the Vault  Barack Obama presentation was just recently posted on YouTube. In the video, Obama is introduced as a Harvard Law School student and President of the Harvard Law Review. He discusses  Frank  as Frank Marshall Davis at about 8:37 in the video.In his remarks, Obama never identifies Davis as a communist or even a leftist. But the remarks do reflect the significant influence that Davis had over his young life as he was growing up in Hawaii. Obama talks about how Davis  schools  him on the subject of race relations. The term implies a teacher-student relationship the two of them had, confirming what we had reported back in 2008, that Davis had functioned as Obama s  mentor. It s important to understand what Obama is saying here. Getting ready to read directly from his book, Dreams from My Father, Obama talks about the passages ending with  me having a conversation with a close friend of my maternal grandfather, a close friend of gramps, a black man from Kansas, named Frank, actually at the time a fairly well-known poet named Frank Marshall Davis, who had moved to Hawaii and lived there, and so I have a discussion with him about the kinds of frustrations I m having, and he sorts of schools me that I should get used to these frustrations Davis was indeed a black poet. His works included attacks on Christianity. One Davis poem referred to Christ irreverently as a  nigger.  Davis was himself an atheist.However, Davis was better known as a communist propagandist whose work for the Communist Party in Hawaii earned him surveillance by the FBI and placement on its  security index.  Davis was also a pornographer who engaged in bizarre sexual practices, even pedophilia.Needless to say, Obama s willingness to identify  Frank  as Davis before this audience raises questions as to why  Frank  wasn t identified by his full name Frank Marshall Davis in the book itself. Obama made references to  Frank  22 times throughout his book. Paul Kengor notes that Obama s audio version of Dreams from My Father omitted every reference to  Frank  that was in the book. Those omissions were clearly designed to keep people from asking questions about  Frank,  since Obama was considering a run for the presidency.Today, in 2015, discovering film of Obama identifying  Frank  as Davis is confirmation of the obvious. It doesn t make a lot of difference politically, since Obama is serving out his second term. But it could have made a difference seven years ago, in 2008, when we identified  Frank  as Davis, during Obama s campaign for his first term in office.The clip of Obama talking about Davis during his 1995 Cambridge presentation is important for other reasons, however.By his own admission, Obama was preoccupied with his own feelings and thoughts about race relations. He saw himself as an  angry young man  whose father was absent from his life. He said he was  without father figures around who might guide and steer my anger. That s significant because it s clear, from the passages he reads, that Davis became that father figure. Davis was indeed picked by his white grandfather to be a role model or father figure for the young Barack Obama.In the passages he read back in 1995, Obama discussed inviting some white friends to a black party and seeing them squirm.  They re trying to tap their foot to the beat and being extraordinarily friendly,  he said. They are trying to fit in but they are uncomfortable and they tell Obama they want to leave. Obama concluded,  What I have had to put up with every day of my life is something that they find so objectionable that they can t even put up with a day. This is like a revelation to Obama about the world of white racism. All of this he says  triggers  something in his head and he comprehends a  new map of the world.  He gets a sense of the anger and betrayal in society and even in his own family, where he is being raised by his white grandfather,  Gramps,  and white grandmother,  Toot.  This leads him to seek advice from  Frank.  Frank Marshall Davis then  sort of schools me that I should get used to these frustrations,  Obama says.The passages that he reads from the book before the Cambridge audience include a discussion of when his own white grandmother was accosted by a black panhandler. Davis told Obama that his grandmother was right to be scared and that  She understands that black people have reason to hate. In other words, Davis did not encourage Obama to pursue racial harmony or reconciliation. He told Obama that blacks have a reason, or right, to hate.Via:AIM.comh/t Weasel Zippers",BREAKING: VIDEO OF YOUNG OBAMA EMERGES Discussing Mentor Frank Marshall Davis’ Advice About Growing Up In A White Racist World

The huge deductions these millennials see on their paychecks usually takes care of the naive attitude of the immature, idealistic crybabies. People who escaped the former Soviet Union and came to America are not feeling the Bern. Perhaps because they know exactly what it s like to live in the socialist utopia Bernie Sanders wants for America.The Atlantic reports:Why Soviet Refugees Aren t Buying Sanders s SocialismSAN FRANCISCO Janna Sundeyeva still remembers life in the Soviet Union, where stores in remote regions would lack meat for months at a time and toilet paper had to be snatched up quickly on the rare occasions it appeared.But the minor indignities paled in comparison to what happened to her grandfather: He had the chance to come to America in 1929, but he opted to stay, sensing an economic thaw. Seven years later, Sundeyeva says, he was arrested and never heard from again.Sundeyeva immigrated to San Francisco from Moldova in 1994, and now she and her husband run a Russian-language newspaper here called Kstati. Her Soviet experience colors how she sees U.S. politics to this day. I don t like big government,  Sundeyeva said. She made two circles with her thumbs and forefingers and pressed them against each other so they touched, like binoculars. This Venn diagram represents the interests of people and government, she said.  They don t have very much in common. Today, she s not a registered Republican, but like many of the readers of her newspaper, she said she s starting to lean toward supporting Donald Trump for president. The other self-styled outsider in the race, though, holds no appeal for her. The only Bern she and many other Russians here are feeling is the one in the banya.To Sundeyeva, left-wingers seem to yearn for a workers  revolution.  I would ask them: Have you ever lived under a revolution?  she said.  Do you know what it s like? When someone comes and takes your family member in the night? Interviews with more than a dozen immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the Bay Area suggest that some in the community are recoiling from Bernie Sanders and his leftist ideals. One hundred years after the Bolshevik Revolution swept Communists into power, some Russians in America say they can t believe a serious candidate in the United States is calling himself a socialist.Many of us can t believe it either, folks.Bernie s support among young people can be chalked up to ignorance.

He s not about to sit back and ignore North Korea s crazy dictator, as he continues to threaten the United States.CNS News   President Obama, speaking at his final news conference in Laos, said his approach to North Korea is  to not reward bad behavior,  but he also admitted that his approach isn t working because Pyongyang  has continued to engage in the development of their nuclear program. Obama spoke shortly before North Korea conducted its fifth   and largest   nuclear test.Obama said he is  deeply disturbed  by North Korea s continued flouting of  international obligations,  and he pointed to the defensive measures   the deployment of U.S. THADD missiles in South Korea   intended to protect the U.S. and its allies.North Korea upped its warmongering with Donald Trump today in a series of menacing boasts threatening to  ravage  US troops amid fears the two countries are heading for war.The secretive state vowed to  pulverize  US bases and South Korean capital Seoul if it was threatened by the US military, which is carrying out drills on the Korean peninsula. A US aircraft carrier group is steaming towards the region.It claimed it would  ruthlessly ravage  the US if Washington attacked. China warned the region could go to war  at any moment .The rhetoric comes after North Korea warned that President Donald Trump s  troublemaking  and  aggressive  tweets have pushed the world to the brink of thermo-nuclear war.Pyongyang s Vice Minister Han Song Ryol accused Trump of building up a  vicious cycle  of tensions and warned the US against provoking North Korea militarily. He said:  We will go to war if they choose. He added the country would continue developing its nuclear program and conduct its next nuclear test whenever its leaders see fit.In the past week Trump has shown his willingness to launch military strikes, with US missiles deployed in Syria and Afghanistan.In other developments today, as tensions heighten in the Korean peninsula:Pence plans to celebrate Easter with US and Korean troops on Sunday before talks on Monday with acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn. We re going to consult with the Republic of Korea on North Korea s efforts to advance its ballistic missile and its nuclear program,  a White House foreign policy adviser told reporters, previewing Pence s trip.Pence will land in Seoul the day after North Korea s biggest national day, the  Day of the Sun. The White House has contingency plans for Pence s trip should it coincide with a another North Korean nuclear test by its leader Kim Jong Un, the adviser said. Unfortunately, it s not a new surprise for us. He continues to develop this program, he continues to launch missiles into the Sea of Japan,  the adviser said. With the regime it s not a matter of if   it s when. We are well prepared to counter that,  the adviser said.U.S. officials have played down the prospect of any military strike against North Korea, which would likely provoke massive North Korean retaliation and huge casualties in Japan and South Korea and among U.S. forces in both countries.China, North Korea s sole major ally and neighbor, opposes its weapons program and has called for talks leading to a peaceful resolution and the denuclearization of the peninsula. Military force cannot resolve the issue,  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters in Beijing.  Amid tensions we will also find a kind of opportunity to return to talks. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also underscored fears about possible threats from North Korea, telling parliament in Tokyo that Pyongyang could have the capacity to deliver missiles equipped with sarin nerve gas.CIA director Mike Pompeo said North Korea was closer now than it had ever been to being able to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped intercontinental missile and increased its technical know-how with each new test.Experts do not believe North Korea has a deliverable long-range nuclear weapon, or intercontinental missiles.But that could change within the next few years, as experts say North Korea could have a viable nuclear warhead and a ballistic missile capable of hitting the US mainland during Trump s watch as president.Aerial photos taken Tuesday show continued activity at the Punggye-ri Nuclear site where US officials fear a nuclear device has been installed in a tunnel ahead of another test.And Han, referring to North Korea as the Democratic People s Republic of Korea, said Friday:  If the US comes with reckless military maneuvers then we will confront it with the DPRK s preemptive strike. We ve got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands, and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a U.S. preemptive strike. The message had been echoed in the days before, when North Korea said it would launch a  merciless retaliatory strike  against US military action.Pyongyang also recently launched a ballistic missile and some experts say it could conduct another nuclear test at virtually anytime.For entire story: Daily Mail ",N.

It s a rhetorical question of course UNION GROVE, Wis.   Pretend you re a Muslim. That s what a 10th grade World History writing assignment asks students to do at a Wisconsin high school.WISN talk radio host Vicki McKenna posted Union Grove High School teacher Beth Urban s email for a five-paragraph essay on Twitter.It reads: Pretend you are:1. Muslim male/female in U.S.2. Give 3 examples of what you do daily for your religion and any struggles you face.3. Again, 5 paragraphs (intro, 3 body paragraphs, closing.)**Keep in mind we ve been doing work and watching documentaries that have the facts needed to write the essay.Union Grove Muslim essay assignment fullEAGnews emailed Urban to obtain more information on the assignment but she did not respond.Specifically, we wanted to know if there were similar assignments based on other religions or just Islam, as well as what documentaries were watched to prepare for the essay.A parent of the student who received the assignment tells EAGnews,  I feel that the purpose of the assignment is to show prejudices towards Muslims in America or to invent them or exaggerate them. The parent, who asked to remain anonymous, doesn t blame the teacher for the essay s instructions. I did not voice my concerns directly to the teacher because I do not blame the teacher. I believe this is a curriculum issue. The teachers are not using their own curriculum, the school boards/superintendents do generally,  according to the parent. I brought attention to it because I felt that it was inaccurate for World History. I would have no problem with this assignment if they were to pretend they were in the Middle East and practicing their religion. I first was bothered because it seems that if any Catholic issues are brought up attention is brought to the school and (the assignment) banned being a public school.

"Apr 15, 2016","Is there any question what Obama s priorities are in his final 8 1/2 months in office? His legacy will most certainly be that of the most divisive President (and First Lady) to ever occupy the White House. Every law enforcement officer in America should be concerned about his obsession with taking them down a few notches.President Obama is meeting with a group of music stars on Friday to discuss his push for criminal justice reform and his initiaitve dedicated to helping young men and boys of color.Rappers Busta Rhymes, Common, J. Cole, Wale, Ludacris and Chance the Rapper are all attending the meeting, according to a senior administration official.The meeting comes as Obama is trying to beef up support for the My Brother s Keeper Initiative, which is designed to help young African-Americans get an education, college degree and job training.Obama and his supporters launched a nonprofit group last May that will allow the president to continue the work once he leaves office.The president has also tried to keep momentum behind a bipartisan coalition looking to pass legislation in Congress that would reduce prison sentences for many non-violent drug offenders. Senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and My Brother s Keeper task force chairman Broderick Johnson also attended the meeting.War On Cops: President Obama says his  criminal justice reform    doublespeak for pardoning criminals and investigating cops   is gaining bipartisan support. New FBI crime data should stop the movement in its tracks.Last fall, we argued that Obama s war on police, prosecuted with the help of his Black Lives Matter goons, sparked a  national crime wave.   Violent criminals are getting the upper hand as the  Ferguson effect  takes hold in cities across the country,  we noted.  Less-aggressive policing has emboldened the bad guys, leading to a nationwide spike in murder. Officers fear violating softer new use-of-force and arrest policies, pushed on cities by the Obama Justice Department, will open them up to civil-rights prosecution. Many have backed off patrols and stops in dangerous urban areas as a result. The result: Year-over-year homicide rates are up 76% in Milwaukee; 60% in St. Louis; 56% in Baltimore; 44% in Washington, D.C.; 22% in New Orleans; 20% in Chicago; 20% in Kansas City; and 17% in Dallas. Single-digit rises have been seen in New York and other cities. Soon after, FBI Director James Comey indicated that spiking murder rates may be partly due to the  Ferguson effect    police reluctance to carry out their duties over fear of being investigated for abuse or discrimination, or shot by angry thugs in the line of duty.Police chiefs echoed his concerns, prompting the attorney general to gather major police chiefs and mayors together in Washington for a crime summit. It was supposed to be a closed meeting, no press allowed.But a Washington Post reporter snuck in and recorded Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel complaining that all the vitriol thrown at cops had put them in a  fetal  position. Obama s former chief of staff said they were backing off crime in gang-infested areas of his city.Obama pooh-poohed the city-by-city reports of climbing murder rates, arguing that there wasn t any aggregate data to show a national trend. But now we have the national data from the FBI. It confirms that the U.S. murder rate shot up 6.2% in the first half of 2015 from a year earlier. The spike reverses a three-year downtrend.Overall violent crime   murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault   rose almost 2%, in contrast to a nearly 5% drop in the comparable period of 2014. Violent crime rose in all but one of the nation s four regions, the FBI said, and all but two city groupings.If liberal pundits and politicians want to stop soaring crime rates, they should stop vilifying cops. And they should start speaking out against the Black Lives Matter race-mongers and their  criminal-justice reforming  patrons in the White House.

They are accessible to clients of Trac-B Exchange, a program run by the Las Vegas Hard Reduction Center.And the machines don t take money. Instead, drug users scan a card and enter a unique ID number in order to vend one of the colorfully gift-wrapped boxes inside. This is a harm reduction approach,  said Chelsi Cheatom, program manager for Trac-B Exchange, in an interview with NBC Las Vegas affiliate KSNV.  People are already exchanging in these behaviors, and anytime someone s engaging in a behavior that could cause them some potential health side effects, we want to encourage them to reduce their risk of harm. The center worked in collaboration with the Southern Nevada Health District and the Nevada AIDS Research and Education Society (NARES) to install the new machines, which will be available at three different locations by the end of May. Each client will be limited to two kits a week; each box contains syringes, alcohol wipes, safe sex supplies, and a sharps disposal box. Providing clean needles and supplies is a proven method for limiting disease transmission in a community,  said Dr. Joe Iser, Chief Health Officer of the Southern Nevada Health District, in a statement Wednesday.Nevada is the first U.S. state to launch a vending machine program for clean syringes, but the vending machine model has been in use for several years in Puerto Rico, Europe, and Australia.In 2014, a harm-reduction group installed crack pipe vending machines in Vancouver, Canada.

"Apr 16, 2016","The victim of the angry Bernie Sanders supporter has an amazing attitude. It s the civility many of us have come to expect from Trump supporters who ve been unjustly attacked by uncivil and in many cases, unlawful Bernie Sanders supporters. A politically-motivated vandal in Washington State admittedly vandalized a Trump supporter s car, slashing its tires and dumping rotten yogurt through its sun roof, according to a police report filed last Monday.The suspect, named in the report as one Riley M. Silva of Gig Harbour, Washington, confessed his crime to the police. Showing no sign of remorse, he claimed his victim was an  ignorant bigot  and that he  improved the community  by vandalizing the car. According to the report, the culprit became angry after noticing that the car sported a Donald Trump sticker.His full confession to the police, which was originally posted on the blog of lawyer and author Mike Cernovich, reads as follows:I on the 11th day of the 4th month of 2016 did maliciously attack a hate symbol protected by the first amendment. After disabling the vehicle and dumping rotten food into the interior I feel I have improved the community and supported our nation s values by stopping a promoter of hate speech. I do not wish to have ignorant bigots in my town and in a just world the person deserved what was received and the situation is made whole.As America is far from just, I expect the bigot will want to be made whole. With this I declare he is owed nothng. But as the situation is what it is, I intend to make the individual whole provided he cease to promote ignorance and hate. I do not expect the law to recognize damage to tools of hate or fascism. Such things need to be destroyed so good people may remain and become free.The victim, Nathan Elliot, later posted pictures of the damage to his vehicle. In his statement to the police, he said that the damage to the tire alone would cost $500 to repair.Bernie Sanders supporter didn't like my Trump bumper sticker, so he vandalized my personal property.

"Apr 17, 2015","Dr. Gina Loudon is hands down one of our favorite conservative writers. She nails it with this piece about the truth behind the lies of the California drought I found it supremely ironic this week that two of the big stories were about a man-made lack of water in California, and a man lost in a vast sea off of Florida.Gov. Jerry  Moonbeam  Brown announced the dire circumstances, not from the Capitol in Sacramento, but from the dramatic backdrop of a mountaintop. His narrative held that there should be five feet of  snow pack,  but alas, there was none. Brown, and the radical Marxists, couched as  environmentalists  he represents, have convinced most Americans to hold two radically opposing views simultaneously. Ostensibly, California is in danger of being flooded by rising sea levels caused by global warming and melting polar ice caps, and it is also utterly out of water.There is no shortage of water. This is an environmentalist-created drought that is costing billions.I waver between utter disgust and admiration when I watch how the leftists sell these things, always with straight faces. Every major news outlet in America and many around the world swallowed the narrative like fish on a baited hook. They tell us there is no water, no snow to provide water for the summer, and the farmers are taking too much so people must suffer. There is an all-out war on grass, and no one is safe. Sorry, Shaggy, your  grass  is to blame as well.There is hand wringing in every club house as the boards are told they are coming for the rough grass, your fairways and greens are safe, for now. Evil rich guys in colorful knickers and almond farmers in overalls are the scourge of California. Off with their heads! Oh, and you can forget about the luxury of children playing on the lawn. If you want that, you breeders should move to flyover land! Don t you dare sneak and water the backyard after dark; Brown makes it easy for your neighbors to snitch on you. I m not making this up. They really have a state hotline for that.Those of us who pay attention know well the proverb,  Where there is no vision, the people perish.  The people who built California into the greatest agricultural producer in America gave us dams, canals, reservoirs and all kinds of conveyance of water. They harnessed the rivers that reach from the Pacific Northwest down well into Northern California and even draw water to the Golden State from the Colorado River. That was then. Nothing has changed since then, except political power.For the last several decades, the radical fringe has taken full control of California, and it hates people. Dennis Prager observed that statists love humanity but hate humans. Watch how they latch onto dreams of egalitarian states but begin the execution of their plans by marginalizing, isolating and then executing anyone who disagrees with them. They dine in the finest restaurants in San Francisco, the likes of Brown, Pelosi, Boxer and Feinstein, planning lawsuits to cut the flow of water to the farms of Central California and the people in Southern California, caring not a wit that 40,000 agricultural workers, mostly Hispanic, are unemployed.Just this week, in the middle of a human crisis, federal fish agents ordered the release of billions of gallons of water purportedly to save six fish. You read that right. Not to save six species of fish, but literally, six fish. Apparently, these special six stood their, err ground, and when 29 of their compadres rode the 10 billion gallon man-made wave to the ocean in March, they refused to go with the flow (sorry).You can t make this stuff up. But when you do, people actually believe it.So Obama administration agents want a second toilet flush to give these hard-headed steelheads a second nudge. The idea that nature itself may be holding the fish where they are is of no concern to statists who love telling both man and beast what they think is good for them. Sadly, this latest mind-boggling atrocity is getting very little media coverage. I found excellent coverage in the Manteca Bulletin. Why hasn t the Los Angeles Times reported on this?The current shortage is based primarily on the release of billions of gallons daily into the San Francisco Bay to sustain the bait fish known as the Delta smelt. This is a simple distribution issue; there is plenty of water.Prior to the statists taking over California, massive pumps were diverting water from rivers into the canal system (built before Brown and his ilk took control of the state). They have all but turned these pumps off to protect the fish from their Darwinian demise, and billions upon billions of gallons of fresh water is continuously dumped into the ocean.For the people-hating San Francisco cabal, cutting off water from the people is the real goal. They want fewer people to begin with, but the ultimate goal is control. Few environmentalists admit it publicly, but they want zero farming in the central valley, preferring to  allow  land to return to its prehistoric state. The cabal wants to control water so they can control people. Brown is just the messenger today. He is telling America that water access is a privilege, he has the power to pick winners and losers, and we have to just take it.If Brown decides tomorrow that he wants to withhold water from almond farmers, Americans will just have to accept it. Have you ever wondered why any business owner would give campaign donations to Marxist, business-hating politicians? Now you know why. They must give to buy protection. Business owners do not donate to Brown, Pelosi or Harry Reid because those politicians are good for business; they give to be sure they are not the next targets.The problem with all of this is that water is a limitless natural resource. Just ask the sailor who faced drowning daily or the people in the Midwest who were deluged this week. It is one thing to argue for conservation of animals, or even trees, or  green space,  but water? Water is a limitless natural resource. Not even the most self-important leftist believes he could make water go away, no matter how hard he tried. How did they convince us to accept this lie?They got us to buy the lie that water is scarce by telling it often enough and pounding it into generations of schoolchildren. Using federal law and acts of Congress, they forced people from water-soaked regions to accept low flush or what some call  two flush  toilets the same as desert-dwelling Californians. And we fell for it. At least the Democrats among us fell for it.Thus it is that Brown got to have his cake and eat it, too. He told Californians, and really all Americans and the world, that lack of water was not his fault for lacking the vision to feed the distribution system created by the real men who built California. He repeats that it is not the fault of the Marxists  Endangered Species Act that prefers hard-headed fish over people. The lack of water is the result of the lack of  snow pack,  which is the result of  climate change,  which is the result of greedy people being well, people. The Delta smelt and steelhead trout must live and we mere humans should all just die.Meanwhile, Jerry Brown is committed to spending $100 billion for trains, but he has made zero commitment to allowing water to flow to people instead of fish, and zero commitment to finding funding for his  twin tunnels  alternate solution. And why would he? We are cutting back our water use, ratting on our neighbors and accepting higher produce prices across America. The Marxists in San Francisco are toasting total victory. The farmers and country club board members are suing for peace.

"Apr 19, 2015"," I m Doug Hughes, I m 61 years old and I m a mailman working out of Riverview, Florida. No sane person would do what I m doing. I had carefully planned it so that no one would get hurt, including me especially me. I thought about being 75 years old and watching the collapse of this country, and thinking that I had an idea that might have arrested the fall  and didn t do it. And I will tell you, completely honestly that I d rather die in the flight than live to be 80 years old and see this country fall. The wife of a Florida man who was arrested after he landed a one-man gyrocopter on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol building to protest money in politics insists that her husband is a patriot.While she says that she was not aware that her husband was going to attempt the illegal flight to Washington, Alena Hughes nonetheless believes that her husband is a  patriot  who  loves his country. I think he s a patriot and I m proud of him,  Mrs. Hughes told the media.Still, the whole incident has been  stressful,  Alena said.Doug Hughes, 61, a post office employee from Tampa Bay, Florida, told Capitol police that his gyrocopter mission was to highlight  money in politics  and he intended to deliver a letter to each member of Congress to urge them to initiate campaign finance reform.Since his arrest, the 61-year-old also claimed that the 2012 suicide of his son, John Joseph, also motivated him to make his protest flight.Hughes hired an attorney in Washington, but Mrs. Hughes also hired Paul Carr, her own attorney, just in case.Mrs. Hughes  attorney had an interesting take on Mr. Hughes  actions.  Tell me what restrictions mailmen have to deliver mail,  Carr said. The attorney went on saying,  He has a right to deliver mail. In fact, it s his obligation. Purportedly getting money out of politics has been a long-time goal of the left-wing.

Obama turned to British spies to get surveillance on Trump pic.twitter.com/IghCFm7qhO  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) March 14, 2017 Grassley began his investigation after the Washington Post reported on February 28 that the FBI,  a few weeks before the election,  agreed to pay former British spy Christopher Steele to investigate Trump.Prior to that, supporters of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign had paid Steele to gather intelligence on Clinton s Republican rival. In the end, the FBI did not pay Steele, the Post reported, after the dossier  became the subject of news stories, congressional inquiries and presidential denials.  It is not clear whether Steele worked under agreement with the FBI for any period of time before the payment deal fell through. The idea that the FBI and associates of the Clinton campaign would pay Mr. Steele to investigate the Republican nominee for president in the run-up to the election raises further questions about the FBI s independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration s use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends,  Grassley wrote in a letter to Comey dated March 28.MCCABE HAS BEEN ON THE HOT SEAT BEFORE:BREAKING: CROOKED VA GOVERNOR, Close Hillary Friend Gave Wife Of FBI Official Overseeing Hillary Email Investigation $467,500The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton s email use.Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI.The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.Mr. McAuliffe and other state party leaders recruited Dr. McCabe to run, according to party officials. She lost the election to incumbent Republican Dick Black.A spokesman for the governor said he  supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors  Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous. Among political candidates that year, Dr. McCabe was the third-largest recipient of funds from Common Good VA, the governor s PAC, according to campaign finance records. Dan Gecker received $781,500 from the PAC and $214,456 from the state party for a campaign that raised $2.9 million, according to records; and Jeremy McPike received $803,500 from the PAC and $535,162 from the state party, raising more $3.8 million that year for his candidacy.The governor could recall only one meeting with Mr. McCabe when he and other state Democrats met with the couple on March 7, 2015, to urge Dr. McCabe to run, according to the spokesman.

In 1968, Hillary Clinton Worked On The Presidential Campaign Of Senator Eugene McCarthy In  New Hampshire That Winter.     Ms. Rodham had traveled to New Hampshire several times that winter to volunteer for Mr. McCarthy, the Minnesota Democrat challenging President Lyndon B. Johnson for the Democratic nomination. Mr. McCarthy s message   that the antiwar movement should operate within the system, not on the streets   appealed to Ms. Rodham. ..  Her political itinerary that year resembles a frenzied travelogue of youthful contradiction.

"Apr 21, 2016","This is a powerful story of a courageous young woman who is fighting for the rights of women and children everywhere in America to feel safe in public bathrooms and locker rooms. It is a MUST read and SHARE story.A few months ago, Kaeley Triller, from the  Keep Locker Rooms Safe  organization and a victim of rape registered for a workshop called  The Story Workshop  at the Allende Center in Seattle. It was primarily aimed at helping survivors of sexual abuse find the purpose and weight in their fractured personal narratives, the conference promised to be intense but deeply healing.I don t know exactly what I expected. I was naively hopeful that I would get a few good writing tips that would enable me to beautify my past and approach it like one of Aesop s fables third-person fiction with a perfect little moral at the end of the story.That s not what happened. One of the pre-assignments was to write 700 words about a painful childhood memory. I was surprised at the one I chose. It wasn t a heavy hitter, so to speak. I wrote about a Polaroid picture I kept rediscovering in a shoebox at my parents  house, and my inability to figure out why looking at it made me want to rip it to shreds.I m about ten years old in the picture, with scraggly hair, pale skin, and a vacant expression. I m wearing my mom s oversized knit sweater and Oxford shoes my dad had bought me. In my hands is a piece of green felt I d cut into the shape of New York for a school report about a U.S. state. Coincidentally or not, New York is the place my abuser had recently moved. I think I wanted to be closer to him. Don t try to understand it. I still don t.My small group dissected the story with grace and insight that could only be offered by those who spoke the same horrific language of shame and rage and grief. I felt nothing as I spoke about it.  It is what it is,  I remember saying, committed to my ambivalence. My group leader brushed away a tear and said,  Kaeley, this story breaks my heart. Why do you hate the little girl in that picture so much?  I couldn t access her understanding or her empathy. I recognized the accuracy of her assessment, but I didn t know how to change it.Later that evening, one of the workshop presenters tasked us with a seemingly benign activity. We were instructed to play with crayons and miniature tubs of play dough on the tables in front of us. I hated these types of exercises. I thought they were such a waste of time. I reached for a purple crayon and reluctantly complied. I drew a picture of a flower and rolled a snake out of my play dough. And I burst into tears.The invitation to engage as a child had revealed my whole dilemma: I didn t hate the little girl in the photo. I hated her need. I hated her anonymity. I hated the visible proof that she loved her abuser. I hated that she didn t know any better, that it took her another ten years to figure out why she still slept with the light on and showered in her underwear and vigilantly lined the crack under the bathroom door with a beach towel and destroyed her teeth with gum she relentlessly chewed as a means of escaping the recollection of his breath on her face. I hated that he fooled her. He fooled everybody. He was really good. Wake up!  I wanted to scream at her.  Can t you see what s going on? Do something about it! It s the same desperate inclination I m fighting today. Everywhere I read in the news, there s talk of another school or gym or business that is boldly adopting  progressive  new locker room policies designed to create equal rights for people who identify as transgender. These policies allow transgender individuals to use the locker room consistent with the sex they identify as their own, regardless of anatomy.While some have proposed a third option for transgender people (single-occupancy restrooms and showers), this option has been largely struck down, and employees are prohibited from suggesting it, as it is considered discriminatory and emotionally damaging to a group of people who are working so hard to fit in. The solution? Anyone can use whatever restroom he or she wants without being questioned.I read these reports, and my heart starts to race. They can t be serious. Let me be clear: I am not saying that transgender people are predators. Not by a long shot. What I am saying is that there are countless deviant men in this world who will pretend to be transgender as a means of gaining access to the people they want to exploit, namely women and children. It already happens. Just Google Jason Pomares, Norwood Smith Burnes, or Taylor Buehler, for starters.While I feel a deep sense of empathy for what must be a very difficult situation for transgender people, at the beginning and end of the day, it is nothing short of negligent to instate policies that elevate the emotional comfort of a relative few over the physical safety of a large group of vulnerable people.Don t they know anything about predators? Don t they know the numbers? That out of every 100 rapes, only two rapists will spend so much as single day in jail while the other 98 walk free and hang out in our midst? Don t they know that predators are known to intentionally seek out places where many of their preferred targets gather in groups? That perpetrators are addicts so committed to their fantasies they ll stop at nothing to achieve them?Do they know that more than 99 percent of single-victim incidents are committed by males? That they are experts in rationalization who minimize their number of victims? Don t they know that insurance companies highlight locker rooms as a high-risk area for abuse that should be carefully monitored and protected?Don t they know that one out of every four little girls will be sexually abused during childhood, and that s without giving predators free access to them while they shower? Don t they know that, for women who have experienced sexual trauma, finding the courage to use a locker room at all is a freaking badge of honor? That many of these women view life through a kaleidoscope of shame and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, dissociation, poor body image, eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, difficulty with intimacy, and worse?Why would people knowingly invite further exploitation by creating policies with no safeguards in place to protect them from injury? With zero screening options to ensure that biological males who enter locker rooms actually identify as female, how could a woman be sure the person staring at her wasn t exploiting her? Why is it okay to make her wonder? Wake up!  I want to scream.  Can t you see what s going on? Do something about it! Despite the many reports of sexual abuse and assault that exist in our world, there s an even larger number of victims who never tell about it. The reason? They re afraid no one will believe them. Even worse, they re terrified of a reality they already innately know to be true: even if people did know, they wouldn t do anything to help. They re not worth protecting. Even silence feels better than that.There s no way to make everyone happy in the situation of transgender locker room use. So the priority ought to be finding a way to keep everyone safe. I d much rather risk hurting a smaller number of people s feelings by asking transgender people to use a single-occupancy restroom that still offers safety than risk jeopardizing the safety of thousands of women and kids with a policy that gives would-be predators a free pass.Is it ironic to no one that being  progressive  actually sets women s lib back about a century? What of my right to do my darndest to insist that the first time my daughter sees the adult male form it will be because she s chosen it, not because it s forced upon her? What of our emotional and physical rights? Unless and until you ve lined a bathroom door with a towel for protection, you can t tell me the risk isn t there.For me, healing looks like staring at the little girl in a Polaroid photo and validating her need to be seen, heard, and protected instead of hating it. It looks like telling my story, even the parts I can never make pretty, in hopes it will help break the anonymity of survivors and create a sense of responsibility in others to act.I still battle my powerlessness to do anything that feels substantial to affect change, but the good Lord didn t bring me out of Egypt and set my feet upon a rock so I could stand idly by in the face of danger. So even if a little article or Facebook post doesn t ultimately change the world, it s better than silent resignation to negligence and harm. I feel a sense of urgency to invite people to consider the not-so-hidden dangers of these policies before more and more of them get cemented into place. Once that happens, the only way they ll change is when innocent people get hurt.Even if there aren t hundreds of abusers rushing into locker rooms by the dozens, the question I keep asking myself is,  What if just one little girl gets hurt by this? Would that be enough to make people reconsider it? And what if that little girl was me?  It s a question I really don t want to ask. But God s grace has enabled me to value the face in the photo enough to realize that I have to. And even if I don t like the answer, at least I wasn t silent.Author  Kaeley Triller Via: The Federalist",POWERFUL: A RAPE SURVIVOR EXPLAINS Why Men Should Never Be Allowed In Women’s Bathrooms And Locker Rooms
"Apr 21, 2017","Another great move by the Trump administration! They were proactive in securing the release of Aya Hijazi.

"Apr 22, 2015","Adios America Census: Record 51 million immigrants in 8 years, will account for 82% of U.S. growthWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker disrupted the debate this week when he said that legal immigration also needs to be reformed to make sure Americans don t suffer by losing jobs to new citizens.But even more, the CIS report said that the surge in mostly legal immigrants will have a huge impact on the nation and taxpayers. These numbers have important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment,  said Steven Camarota, the center s director of research.  They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants. Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers. Those numbers are likely to shake up Washington s political debate over the 12 million illegals in America, the expected 70,000 expected to pour over the border this year and the 4.4 million legal immigrants on a State Department waiting list who have relatives or jobs in the U.S.A key senator steering the immigration debate, Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions, has warned that higher numbers of immigrants will hurt the middle class. In a letter to the New York Times Saturday, he wrote,  It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs? On Friday, key business leaders including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a group associated with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg plan to pitch for more immigration. Their schedule is below.The numbers, as seen in the highlights below, will also raise concerns that Washington is giving the keys to the nation to new immigrants:  The immigrant population will grow four times faster than the native born population, reaching 15.8 percent, or 57 million, of the nation s population in 2030, 17.1 percent, or 65 million, in 2040, and 18.8 percent, or 78 million, in 2060.  Net immigration this year will be 1.24 million; green cards about 1.1 million.  Immigrants and their descendants  will account for the overwhelming share of population growth,  said the Center in projecting growth. They will account for 75.5 percent from 2010-2050 and 82 percent from 2010-2060.  Census Bureau projects that in 2023 the nation s immigrant population, legal and illegal, will reach 14.8 percent of the total U.S. population, the highest share ever recorded.Via: Washington Examiner",OBAMA’S FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION: Census Record Shows In 8 Years You Won’t Recognize This Country

There s a long history of corruption between McAuliffe and Bill Clinton. Once again, they re just helping each other out  On Friday Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-VA) gave 200,000 felons the right to vote. The list includes rapists and murderers. But, it s OK. It will help Hillary Clinton in the fall. The Washington Post reported:Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) will make all ex-felons in Virginia eligible to vote in the upcoming presidential election, part of a years-long effort to restore full voting rights to former convicts.McAuliffe s announcement in Richmond on Friday will allow an estimated 180,000 to 210,000 former felons who are not in prison or on probation or parole to register to vote this year in Virginia, a battleground state, according to a coalition of civil rights groups that had pushed for the restoration of voting rights.Advocates said McAuliffe s move was the biggest-ever single action taken to restore voting rights in this country. It is a historic day for democracy in Virginia and across our nation,  said Tram Nguyen, co-executive director of the New Virginia Majority, a progressive activist group.  The disenfranchisement of people who have served their sentences was an outdated, discriminatory vestige of our nation s Jim Crow past. Many Republicans viewed McAuliffe s action as a blatant favor to his longtime friend Hillary Clinton, for whom he and his wife recently raised $2 million at their McLean home. It is hard to describe how transparent the Governor s motives are,  House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) said in a statement.  The singular purpose of Terry McAuliffe s governorship is to elect Hillary Clinton President of the United States. This office has always been a stepping stone to a job in Hillary Clinton s cabinet.Republicans were particularly outraged that the policy doesn t take into account the violence of the crime, whether the person committed serial crimes, whether they ve committed crimes since completing their sentence or whether they ve paid their victims back for medical bills.Via: WaPo","HELPING HILLARY: What The Virginia Governor Just Did Will Help 200,000 More People Vote For Hillary"

Is the NBA still a professional sports organization, or have they morphed into a radical social change group? If the answer is the latter, you won t see me pay another dime to sit in the stands of another NBA game. I don t think I m alone in that thinking either. Putting social issues before the safety and well-being of women and children is misguided and dangerous. Click HERE to comment on NBA Commissioner Adam Silver s Facebook page. Commissioner Adam Silver believes the NBA has been  crystal clear  that the 2017 All-Star Game only stays in Charlotte if a North Carolina law goes.Political and business leaders he s spoken with in the state believe it will, so he s holding off for now on setting any deadlines for when the NBA might act.Silver said last week that the law that limits anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay and transgender people was  problematic  for the league, but he believed dialogue was more useful than ultimatums at this point, so has continued discussions with North Carolina officials. The sense was that if the NBA could give us some time, they in the community of North Carolina were optimistic they would see a change in the law. They weren t guaranteeing it and I think which was why my response was the event still is 10 months from now, we don t need to make a decision yet,  Silver said Thursday during a meeting of Associated Press Sports Editors. We ve been, I think, crystal clear that we believe a change in the law is necessary for us to play in the kind of environment that we think is appropriate for a celebratory NBA event, but that we did have some time and that if the view of the people who were allied with us in terms of a change, if their view, the people on the ground in North Carolina, was that the situation would best be served by us not setting a deadline, we would not set a deadline at this time. The North Carolina law directs transgender people to use public toilets corresponding to the sex listed on their birth certificate. The law also excludes LGBT people from state anti-discrimination protections, blocks local governments from expanding LGBT protections, and bars all types of workplace discrimination lawsuits from state courts.Several entertainment acts have already canceled plans for North Carolina but Silver said last week he didn t think a warning that the NBA could pull the All-Star weekend out would send the proper message, particularly because the league still has the Charlotte Hornets, owned by Michael Jordan, playing there. The Hornets host playoff games this weekend.All-Star weekend is scheduled for February. Silver said there is no urgency to make a decision because the league could very easily find out which arenas would take on the event if necessary.Via: AP News  ",NBA THREATENS NC…Let Men Share Bathrooms With Your Daughters Or We’ll Cancel All-Star Game

"Apr 25, 2016","It s easier to hate Trump and spew venom at him and his supporters than to use logic and reason Donald Trump has already forced Mexico to clean up its national image, underscoring how the country suffering from NAFTA could actually benefit from a Trump presidency.Mexico is launching a massive PR campaign to improve perceptions of the country after Trump exposed many of its problems, but this is a good thing: sometimes it takes your worst critic to enforce needed change.In fact, Trump s proposed border wall, hatred of the North American Free Trade Agreement and nationalistic views could help America s southern neighbor.For one thing, a lot of people don t realize NAFTA has fueled mass unemployment in Mexico, which has caused thousands of illegal immigrants to flood into the U.S. looking for jobs. There are no jobs [in Mexico] and NAFTA forced the price of corn so low that it s not economically possible to plant a crop anymore,  Rufino Dom nguez, the former coordinator of the Binational Front of Indigenous Organizations, revealed.  We come to the U.S. to work because we can t get a price for our product at home. There s no alternative. NAFTA disrupted Mexico s corn production so badly that 75,000 Iowa farmers were able to grow twice as much corn as 3,000,000 Mexican producers   and at half the cost because the U.S. maintained its corn subsidies under NAFTA.That resulted in the mass migration of Mexican farm workers flowing into America. The big wave in illegal immigration from Mexico began in the 1980s, but it picked up strongly after NAFTA   that wasn t unexpected,  NPR s Tim Robbins reported.And which presidential candidate has spoke out against NAFTA and other destructive trade agreements? Donald Trump. It s a disaster,  he said in Sept.  We will either renegotiate it, or we will break it. For entire story: Prison Planet ",HOW MEXICO COULD ACTUALLY Benefit From A Trump Presidency

Well, he raised 200K for Obama: That should tell you all you need to know about this guy except one more HUGE thing:He s the judge who blocked the Planned Parenthood videos:A federal judge late Friday granted a temporary restraining order against the release of recordings made at an annual meeting of abortion providers. The injunction is against the Center for Medical Progress, the group that has unveiled Planned Parenthood s participation in the sale of organs harvested from aborted children.Judge William H. Orrick, III, granted the injunction just hours after the order was requested by the National Abortion Federation.Orrick was nominated to his position by hardline abortion supporter President Barack Obama.

The decision will stay in place while the lawsuit moves through court.The Republican president s administration and two California governments that sued over the order disagreed about its scope.San Francisco and Santa Clara County argued that it threatened billions of dollars in federal funding.But an attorney for the Justice Department, Chad Readler, said at a recent court hearing that it applied to a limited set of grants.Some of Judge Orrick s comments are shocking:Judge Orrick said Trump s order  by its plain language, attempts to reach all federal grants, not merely the three mentioned at the hearing. The rest of the order is broader still, addressing all federal funding. And if there was doubt about the scope of the order, the president and attorney general have erased it with their public comments. Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the president disapproves. Note that once again activist judges use  public comments  just like they did in the prior block to an executive order.

Gateway PunditTrump is resonating with voters who are struggling to make ends meet and who are seeing their friends  jobs shipped abroad, says John Cakmakci, president of United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 951 in Michigan. And some of those voters are union members. Trump s populist positions on trade and his rejection of Washington politics have earned him votes across the Rust Belt, where several battleground states are key to winning the election in November Donald Trump Jr. explains the  Blue-Collar Billionaire s  appeal with voters: Working America, the political organizing arm of AFL-CIO, wanted to find out whether Trump s  rightwing  message appealed to workers outside Cleveland and Pittsburgh. After interviewing about 1,689 working-class Americans living in households earning less than $75,000, they found out that Trump was in fact the favored candidate. Of the 800 voters who had decided on a candidate at the time of the interview, about 300 favored Trump. Combined, the two Democratic candidates appealed to fewer workers   174 chose Clinton and 95 chose Sanders. While most of Trump s support comes from the staunch Republican base, one in four Democrats who chose a candidate showed a preference for Trump,  said Working America s report.The majority of respondents said they supported the candidate because of his pugnacious personality rather than for, say, his position on trade.On Tuesday, Jared Szczesny, a card-carrying member of the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America Union (UAW), will cast his vote for Trump in Pennsylvania s primary. In 2008 and 2012, UAW endorsed President Obama. This time UAW has yet to endorse a candidate, but is likely to back a Democrat.Szczesny, 31, has never attended a Trump rally.

"Apr 27, 2017","The mayor of New Orleans is being evasive on who funded the removal of 4 statues in the heart of the city. He s also not responding to questions on when the remaining 3 statues will be taken down and what he plans on doing with them.Who is funding the removal? Shouldn t the citizens know? Do the citizens of New orleans not have a say in any of this?Here s the latest:NEW ORLEANS   Just hours after crews working for the city of New Orleans removed the Liberty Place Monument, Mayor Mitch Landrieu was asked repeatedly where the money came from to pay for the removal and who s paying to take down the other three confederate-era monuments of Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis and General P.G.T. Beauregard.The mayor would only say,  We have enough funding to take down all four monuments. City spokesman Tyronne Walker offered this clarification. Due to the widely-known intimidation, threats and reported violence to contractors and employees, safety concerns have been great and donors will remain anonymous. That is the safe and responsible thing to do. Some people  want to know what s next for the city-owned monuments. Crews took the Liberty Place statue to a city warehouse, not far from the Superdome. Kurt Buchert from Save our Circle, a pro-monument group is asking for transparency from the mayor. The mayor is saying they should be in a museum one day,  Buchert said.  That s a very vague statement. They could go sit in a warehouse for 100 years and then be put in a museum when all of us are dead. Political Analyst Clancy DuBos says the mayor should reveal his plans for the statues. I think the burden is on the mayor to bring this to a close,  DuBos said.  He needs to come up with a plan and say he s what s going to happen with these statues. The council should have some input. The public should have some input. One of the other things the mayor isn t revealing at this time is when the rest of the monuments will be removed.He would only say they would be taken down in a similar manner to the Liberty Place statue,  sooner rather than later. Mayor Mitch Landrieu in a statement Monday declared: The removal of these statues sends a clear and unequivocal message to the people of New Orleans and the nation: New Orleans celebrates our diversity, inclusion and tolerance. This is not about politics, blame or retaliation. This is not a na ve quest to solve all our problems at once. This is about showing the whole world that we as a city and as a people are able to acknowledge, understand, reconcile  ..and most importantly choose a better future.

"Apr 28, 2015","Quicken Loans owner, Dan Gilbert is one of the most beloved business owners in the state of MI. Their headquarters are located in the city of Detroit (where people in the suburbs don t typically travel unless they have to). Owner, Dan Gilbert gives back to the city of Detroit and to its residents in a huge way, not the least of which is employing over 7,000 people in their Detroit offices. In 2014, Fortune Magazine named Quicken Loans a  Top 5 Place To Work  for the 11th straight year. When asked what made Quicken Loans such a great place to work, Fortune gave this answer: America s largest online-lending company offers cash incentives to its staff to move to downtown Detroit. According to Salary.com, mortgage bankers in Southeast Michigan average $50,000 a year, but those at Quicken earn $113,000. None of that matters to a corrupt government however, who has a history of shaking down banks. This time however, the goons in our Justice Department may have targeted the wrong business owner.Detroit s own Quicken Loans is the latest target of the Justice Department s shakedown of the nation s lenders.Justice s goons have been systematically extorting protection money from big banks and mortgage lenders, under the threat of federal fraud lawsuits and prison time for their executives.The department s modus operandi would be worthy of racketeering charges if carried out by civilian mobsters.First, the Obama administration whips up a blame-the-banks fervor after the financial collapse. Then, armed with federal fraud statutes adopted after the savings and loan meltdown in the 1980s, it scours the transactions of lenders to find hints of irregularities. It extrapolates from the skimpiest evidence a pattern of widespread abuse, and if needed, frightens insiders into coughing up creative accusations against their employers.With its  proof  in hand, Justice presents institutions with a choice   pay a large and painful fine to make the investigation go away, or try their luck at a jury trial in an environment in which the words  bankers  and  baby killers  register about the same revulsion.The nation s six largest banks have all crumbled, choosing to pay $136 billion in fines and admit their  wrongdoing  rather than get their legs broken.Quicken, owned by Dan Gilbert, has decided not to cower, at least for the moment. Instead of paying protection money, it filed a lawsuit to stop a three-year investigation. Thursday, the government responded by filing charges against Quicken, accusing it of submitting ineligible mortgages for FHA insurance.In its complaint, Quicken says Justice demanded a multi-billion dollar settlement based on a sampling of just 55 of the 246,000 loans issued. Defects, according to the lawsuit, include miscalculating a borrower s income by $17 and lending another $26 too much. In those meager mistakes, Justice sees systemic fraud.Trace evidence is all the Obama administration requires to put banks on the rack. To cinch a settlement, Justice adds the threat of criminal charges against individual executives.Quicken s lawsuit accuses the government of  investigating and pressuring large, high-profile lenders into paying nine- and 10-figure sums and publicly admitting wrongdoing, including conceding that the lenders had made false claims.  That s an exellent summary of Justice s racket.Requiring a public admission of wrongdoing, instead of allowing institutions to settle without acknowledging guilt, as is common practice, leaves open the possibility of future criminal action against executives, assuring that they don t squawk publicly.Gilbert is a different cat than Justice has crossed on Wall Street. Detroit street tough, he doesn t take to being bullied. Of course, the government has a lot of pressure points it can mash. Gilbert is in the gaming business, a highly regulated industry, and the administration is not above targeting his casinos.But I hope he hangs in there. This government has gone gangster, and unless someone takes a stand, it won t be just the big bankers who get pinched.Via: Nolan Finley, Detroit News","GANGSTA GOV ATTEMPTS SHAKEDOWN OF GIANT MORTGAGE COMPANY, Quicken Loans…Owner Stands His Ground"
"Apr 28, 2016","And the winner is the  Anti-Billionaire or the guy who detests rich people or how about the guy who made a LOT of people rich during his campaign, but did absolutely nothing for the less fortunate with his windfall. In fact, we reported about hundreds of homeless people who were kicked out of a venue they used as a warming hut on the coldest night of the year because socialist Bernie Sanders (who cares so much for the poor and underprivileged) was about to host a rally in that venue. Oh well the show must go on who has time for homeless people who likely won t vote .right hypocrite Bernie?The small-dollar fundraising juggernaut that has kept Bernie Sanders s insurgent White House bid afloat far longer than anticipated has generated another unexpected impact: a financial windfall for his team of Washington consultants.As donations surged this year, the Sanders campaign ratcheted up its spending each month, racing through an astounding $45 million in March alone.By the end of March, the self-described democratic socialist senator from Vermont had spent nearly $166 million on his campaign   more than any other 2016 presidential contender, including rival Hillary Clinton. More than $91 million went to a small group of admakers and media buyers who produced a swarm of commercials and placed them on television, radio and online, according to a Washington Post analysis of Federal Election Commission reports.While the vast majority of that money was passed along to television stations and websites to pay for the advertising, millions in fees were kept by the companies, The Post calculated. While it is impossible to determine precisely how much the top consultants have earned, FEC filings indicate the top three media firms have reaped payments of seven figures.Sanders s money blitz, fueled by a $27 average donation that he repeatedly touts, has improbably made the anti-billionaire populist the biggest spender so far in the election cycle. The campaign s wealth has been a surprising boon for vendors across the county who signed on to his long-shot bid.The large profits stem in part from the fact that no one in Sanders s campaign imagined he would generate such enormous financial support. So unlike Clinton, he did not cap how much his consultants could earn in commissions from what was expected to be a bare-bones operation, according to campaign officials.A campaign spokesman declined to comment on whether Sanders feels the high fees earned by his media consultants are appropriate.

"Apr 29, 2015","Who knew that in our  First Black President s  second term killing cops would be all the rage in the black community? A Houston Community College police officer has survived an assassination attempt after being stabbed by her assailant 14 times. The officer was saved by civilians who stepped in and stopped the attacker. The attacker told investigators he did this to get back at police for their brutality. A spokesman from the family said it might be related to the Baltimore riots.Officer April Pikes remains in critical condition at Houston s Ben Taub Hospital, a public relations official at the Houston Police Department said to Breitbart Texas. Her alleged attacker, Jeremiah M. Matthews, 23, was pulled off of her by a group of men while he was stabbing her and attempting to grab her pistol, according to a statement from HPD obtained by Breitbart Texas.Harris County prosecutors said that Matthews told them  he had the intent to attack a police officer and his desire to kill a police officer,  according to a Click2Houston.com report. One of the witnesses, Abe Baker, who helped stop the attack said,  I saw him on her, just stabbing her. I wasn t really thinking,  Baker said.  His arm was just up getting ready to stab her and I just grabbed his arm and took him down, and that s when everybody else came over and we all just took him down. The HPD statement revealed that Matthews stabbed her several times before he was tackled and disarmed. The statement says he was attempting to gain control of her duty weapon. After taking down the suspect, the good Samaritans used the officer s handcuffs to detain Matthews until other police officers arrived and arrested him.The Click2Houston report states that Pike may lose her right arm. She was stabbed repeatedly in her right arm and torso.The scene of the attack was a Walmart located in Meyerland (Southwest Houston), where Pikes was working an approved off-duty security job. Pikes was in uniform when she was attacked. He was in an upbeat mood, whistling and he had a fast pace, walking fast,  Baker said of the assailant, who was smiling and cheerful right up until the moment he began his surprise attack. He does have a diagnostic history of mental illness in the past. To what degree that played into what happened, we don t know,  local community activist Deric Muhammad said, speaking on behalf of the Matthews family. He said it is possible that Matthews was inspired by the riots in Baltimore Monday night.The weapon was described as a hunting knife in a report by Fox26Houston s Kristine Galvan. That was an innocent woman. She had family, loved ones,  Abe Baker told Galvan.  That s someone s life and everyone s life counts and matters. Baker said he stopped by the Walmart on a late-night errand to pick up some laundry soap, and came to the rescue when he heard Pikes  screams. His quick action, and the response of the other men, probably saved her life. I want to offer my condolences to the victim,  said Vanessa Johnson, Matthews  mother, in the Fox26 video.  As a mother this is painful. I wish her a speedy recovery. My heart and prayers are going out to her and their entire family. The HPD statement from Wednesday morning states that Matthews has been charged with Attempted Capital Murder. His case has been assigned to the 182nd State District Court, which is presided over by Judge Jeannine Barr.Via: Breitbart News",BREAKING: TEXAS COP STABBED 14 TIMES By Man Who “had a desire to kill a police officer”

This includes Georgetown University, Duke University, Harvard University and Boston College, among others.The graduation ceremony is called the  Lavender Graduation,  signifying  pink triange that gay men were forced to wear in concentration camps and the black triange designating lesbians as political prisoners in Nazi Germany,  according to HRC.The special ceremony was started in 1995 at the University of Michigan by Dr. Ronni Sanlo, a Jewish lesbian, who said she was denied attendance at her children s graduation because of her sexual orientation. These events provide a sense of community for minority students who often experience tremendous culture shock at their impersonalized institutions,  HRC says on its website, explaining the need for such ceremonies.  For many students they are the payoff for staying in school, and friends and families find the smaller, more ethnic ceremonies both meaningful and personal.

He tells WJZ he s angry about an internal police report published in The Washington Post.  And they trying to make it seem like I told them that, I made it like Freddie Gray did that to hisself (sic),  Allen said.  Why the [expletive] would he do that to hisself (sic)?  Allen was in the van because he allegedly stole a cigarette from a store on North Avenue. He was never charged. Instead he was brought straight to the station.  I talked to homicide. I told homicide the same story.  Allen said. A story he says is being distorted and now he fears being killed.  I had two options today right, either come and talk to y all and get my credibility straight with ya ll and not get killed by these [expletive] or not tell a true story,  Allen added.

We know that Susan Rice lied 5 times on 5 different morning shows the morning after Benghazi. Why wouldn t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including Obama.Susan Rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now. She claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it. Yes, red flags are everywhere on this! The reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the Trump presidency and embarrass him:Andrew McCarthy said it best: The national-security adviser is not an investigator. She is a White House staffer. The president s staff is a consumer of intelligence, not a generator or collector of it. If Susan Rice was unmasking Americans, it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on American interests; it was to fulfill a political desire based on Democratic-party interests.

"Apr 5, 2016","The big question is whether or not Cruz can get the necessary 1,237 delegates?Senator Ted Cruz soundly defeated Donald J. Trump in the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday, breathing new life into efforts to halt Mr. Trump s divisive presidential candidacy and dealing a blow to his chances of clinching the Republican nomination before the party s summer convention.On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in a much closer contest.Mr. Trump s loss was his most significant setback since Mr. Cruz narrowly defeated him in Iowa, the campaign s first nominating contest. And after largely dominating the Republican field from the moment he announced his candidacy last June, Mr. Trump now faces a fresh challenge: bouncing back in the face of searing attack ads by Republicans bent on stopping him, persistent questions about his demeanor and campaign organization, and a single ascendant challenger in Mr. Cruz.In winning Wisconsin so convincingly, Mr. Cruz, of Texas, showed he was capable of appealing to more than just the hard-line and religious conservative Republicans who have been the foundation of his campaign. But he faces daunting tasks of his own. One is consolidating the anti-Trump vote. Another is capturing more moderate Republicans in a series of primaries in Northeastern states that are likely to be favorable territory for Mr. Trump, beginning with New York on April 19.Standing in Mr. Cruz s way is Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who finished a distant third on Tuesday despite spending considerable time in Wisconsin.While Mr. Trump won among moderates, exit polls showed, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich received roughly equal support among those voters in Wisconsin. Mr. Cruz not only took nearly two-thirds of  very conservative  voters, he also won among voters who called themselves only  somewhat conservative. Notably, Mr. Cruz also won among those who did not call themselves born-again Christians   a group with which he has struggled in earlier contests.Most striking, though, was how many Wisconsin primary voters still harbored deep discomfort with Mr. Trump despite his wide lead in the race for delegates. In exit polls, 55 percent said they would be  concerned  or  scared  if he were elected, higher than the other two Republican hopefuls. And 35 percent of those who voted in the Republican primary said they would support Hillary Clinton, a third-party candidate or no one at all if Mr. Trump were the Republican nominee.Mr. Cruz s strong showing will make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to wrap up the 1,237 delegates needed for the GOP nomination before the primary season ends on June 7, when California allocates the largest number of delegates.Next up on the GOP calendar is the April 19 primary in New York, Mr. Trump s home state, where polls show him enjoying a commanding lead of more than 30 percentage points over Mr. Cruz, who in some surveys runs behind Mr. Kasich.New York awards 95 delegates, most of which are allotted proportionately by congressional district. Mr. Trump travels to Long Island on Wednesday to kick off his campaign. Trump has more support than anyone else in New York and always had,  said state assemblyman Bill Nojay of Pittsford, in north-central New York.  If the vote was held today, we expect he would win every single congressional district. A week later, a swath of other East Coast states vote Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Mr. Cruz s best hope is in states farther ahead in the calendar Indiana on May 3 and Nebraska on May 10.Wisconsin with its GOP electorate dominated by the kind of working-class, white voters who have been drawn to Mr. Trump elsewhere was long seen as fertile ground for the New York businessman. But it turned into a hotbed of anti-Trump sentiment. Via: WSJTuesday s stakes were the greatest for the Republicans since March 15, when five large states cast ballots and Mr. Trump s victory in Florida drove Senator Marco Rubio out of the race.Many Republicans hoping to defeat Mr. Trump saw Wisconsin as perhaps their last chance to thwart his march to the nomination. With no other Republican contests in the two weeks before or after, Wisconsin made for an isolated showdown.For Mr. Trump, it was an opportunity to add to his wide delegate lead and score an important psychological victory just as the race turns to his native Northeast. A win in Wisconsin, the sort of Democratic-leaning Midwestern state he has vowed to carry in November, would restore his momentum and undercut those most resistant to his candidacy.

"Apr 6, 2015","Our culture is what makes this Nation great and very exceptional. Unfortunately, we ve elected a president who s changing our nation at warp speed with  refugees  (their words) deposited into towns everywhere: Working and middle class whites are becoming a slave class that toils to provide benefits to the Third Worlders imported to empower the ruling class of elitist liberals. THE CULTURE WAR WE RE INAmericans believe that they are exceptional because their country is exceptional. So the left eagerly swarms to argue that America is not exceptional, except maybe that it s exceptionally bad.Americans believe that individuals succeed with hard work. Obama and Elizabeth Warren bray that  You didn t build that. Americans believe in religion and family. The left sets out to destroy them by proving that these institutions are evil and oppressive. Religious leaders are pedophiles. The family is setting for abuse that makes gay people feel bad. When the dust settlers, the only  good  religion and family are the kind defined by the left. Having destroyed the existing system of organization, the left replaces it with its own. That is the ultimate goal of a culture war. Not mere destruction, but absolute power.The culture war begins by attacking abstract ideas. Then it attacks organizations. Then it attacks people.By attacking the ideas, it undermines the organizations based on them so that it can seize control of them or destroy them. Once that s done, it controls a sector of society and begins enforcing its conformity agenda on individuals. Much of that is underway. The war is drilling down to the individual level. We are approaching the tyranny threshold.At the individual level, the goal of the culture war is to destroy your will to resist them. The left has many tools for doing this.Please read the entire piece by Daniel Greenfield: This Culture War We re InOBAMA ESCALATES CULTURAL GENOCIDEIt isn t enough to invite illegal aliens to invade the USA in their numberless hordes and then quickly distribute them along with their exotic diseases throughout the country. Obama is now using your money to fly them directly from Central America, so as to save them the bother of traveling through Mexico:To facilitate the often treacherous process of entering the United States illegally through the southern border, the Obama administration is offering free transportation from three Central American countries and a special refugee/parole program with  resettlement assistance  and permanent residency.  The new arrivals will be officially known as Central American Minors (CAM) and they will be eligible for a special refugee/parole that offers a free one-way flight to the U.S. from El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras. The project is a joint venture between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the State Department.Readers will recall that DHS was originally set up to defend the homeland. Under the Orwellian Obama Regime, it is in charge of orchestrating an invasion of the homeland.After Pearl Harbor, some feared a Japanese invasion. It would have been preferable to what is happening to us now. If the Imperial Japanese had successfully invaded, they would have ruled for a time, but eventually would have been kicked out. The current invaders aren t going anywhere, and they reproduce much faster than Americans.Plus the Japanese never expected us to pay them to invade us:The candidates will then be granted a special refugee parole, which includes many taxpayer-funded perks and benefits. Among them is a free education, food stamps, medical care and living expenses.  A State Department official promoted CAM as a  family reunification  program that will be completely funded by American taxpayers, though the official claimed to have no idea what the cost will be.Who can put a price on the future?The fig leaf of  refugees  being allowed into the country ahead of immigrants likely to make a positive contribution because their lives are supposedly in danger has been dropped.The State Department official assured that applicants need not express or document a credible fear to qualify under CAM because  we want to make sure this program is open to as many people as possible. Consider this as part of the bigger picture of what is being done to America, and it goes beyond treason. It is cultural genocide.Our rulers know exactly what they are doing. From the official federal propaganda outfit Voice of America:America s demographics are changing like never before. In less than 30 years, whites will no longer be the racial majority in the United States.On the large scale, race and culture are inseparable. Americans are effectively becoming a minority within our own country. Our own democracy will be used against us to relegate us to a permanent second class status (as South Africa demonstrates, whites being a minority hardly spares them from Affirmative Action).Working and middle class whites are becoming a slave class that toils to provide benefits to the Third Worlders imported to empower the ruling class of elitist liberals. Eventually intermarriage will breed the last of our kind out of existence, as VOA happily implies:In 1960, multiracial marriages accounted for only 0.4 percent of all marriages in the United States. By 2010, that figure rose to 8.4 percent, with interracial couples accounting for 15 percent of all new marriages   a trend that experts say will only continue.The VOA piece was given the Orwellian title,  Experts: Coming Demographic Shift Will Strengthen US Culture.  What they mean by this is that the deliberately engineered demographic shift will erase US culture, so that it can be replaced by a multicultural utopia preconceived by cultural Marxists.It used to be genocide meant herding unwanted demographic sectors into gas chambers. But that was crude and inefficient. Simply diluting us out of existence can be done without mess   and incredibly, without resistance.Via: moonbattery",A MUST READ: OBAMA’S TREASON GOES INTO OVERDRIVE

"Apr 7, 2016","No matter which candidate you support, you have to admit that once again Trump has brought up a topic that needs to be discussed. BILLIONS of dollars are sent back to home countries from America. Think of how much we lose when $120 billion dollars leaves America! What if we tell Mexico we will stop this flow of money until they pay to build a wall at the border? The estimate for the wall is $25 billion which is nothing compared to the $120 billion that leaves America every year. While we re bleeding money out, the only amount coming into America is $5.1 billion Yes, $120 billion out, $5.1 billion in.Migrants working in the United States sent a staggering $120 billion back to their families last year, it was revealed today. The amount of money being sent by migrants across the entire world reached $530 billion last year, making it a larger economy than Iran or Argentina, the data from the World Bank showed. This worldwide figure has tripled in the last ten years and is now three times bigger than the total aid budgets given by countries around the world. It has sparked debate whether this so-called remittance money could be a viable alternative to relying on help from other governments. In the United States last year, more than $120 billion was sent by workers to families abroad   making it the largest sender of remittances in the world. More than $23 billion went to Mexico, $13.45 billion to China, $10.84 billion to India and $10 billion to the Philippines, among other recipients.In 2011, the World Bank estimated that U.S. remittances alone reached $110.8 billion, which was more than 80 per cent of the size of the total amount of cash flow ($132 billion). It is little surprise as the US is home to the largest number of migrants from developing countries; there are 42.8 million immigrants in the country, making up around 14 per cent of the population.By contrast, 2.4 million Americans live oversees, with largest populations in Mexico, Canada and Puerto Rico, and just $5.1 billion sent back in to the country, data shared on The Guardian showed. The data showed that the biggest beneficiaries included India and China, which each received more than $60 billion, followed by the Philippines ($24 billion), Mexico ($24 billion) and Nigeria ($21 billion). World Bank officials believe the amount they donate could be billions more because not all cash is sent through banks and money transfer companies on which the figures are based.Read more: Daily Mail",TRUMP IS RIGHT: How Immigrants Sent A Staggering Amount Of American Money Back Home

"Apr 8, 2015","This story just proves what we ve been saying all along. When it comes to unions, it s not about the members, it s about the union leadership and how they can increase their membership numbers (dues). Aiding union leadership in their quest to add members to flailing union membership numbers is just a way for Obama to keep the skids greased and ensure future contributions from one of the largest Democrat party donors (unions) in America. Congressional investigators say they ve uncovered another attempt by the Obama administration to aid illegal immigrants in the U.S.   this time, by teaching foreign workers lessons on union organizing.The National Labor Relations Board has entered into agreements with Mexico, Ecuador and the Philippines to teach workers from those countries in the United States their rights when it comes to union activity.The agreements reportedly don t distinguish between illegal and legal immigrants. But lawmakers are worried it s part of an effort to shield illegal immigrants specifically, by encouraging them to join a union and get protection.NLRB spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek explained to Fox News that under the National Labor Relations Act,  employees, whether documented or undocumented, are protected from retaliation due to union or other protected concerted activity. That means employers could be charged for dismissing an illegal immigrant worker   if the firing is determined to be tied to the worker s union activityHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia, argued illegal immigrant workers could soon learn to exploit the system, creating a catch-22 for businesses. They could instead be charged with violating the National Labor Relations Act because someone will claim that they re doing it because the individual is engaged in unionization activities,  Goodlatte said.He also claimed the Obama administration was trying to keep the NLRB union education agreements, which were originally signed in 2013 and 2014, quiet. This is the first we ve learned of this and it s the first that news organizations have learned of this   and they didn t learn it because the administration came out and told them,  Goodlatte told Fox News. They learned about it because of leaked materials, and again, that is not the kind of transparency the American people expect of their government. An NLRB official, though, disputed the notion that the agreement was a  new development or something that was intentionally being kept out of the news. Yet it isn t just the NLRB that could view union activity as a shield for illegal immigrants.In June 2011, then-Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton issued a memo saying:  ICE officers, special agents and attorneys are reminded to exercise all appropriate discretion on a case-by-case basis when making detention and enforcement decisions in the cases . . . [of] individuals engaging in a protected activity related to civil or other rights (for example, union organizing). While this may serve as a way to boost union membership at a time when their numbers are trending downward, one activist said it will likely hurt U.S. citizen union members in the end. It seems that the union is almost selling out the interests of American workers and legal immigrant workers in order to boost its membership by appealing to illegal workers and getting the assistance of other countries in doing that,  Jessica Vaughan, of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Fox News.Via: FOX News",OBAMA AND UNION LEADERS SELL OUT AMERICAN WORKERS By Turning Illegal Alien Into Union Members

The conference will be dealing with  social, economic, and environmental issues. Sanders announced the Vatican visit on MSNBC s  Morning Joe.  Sanders made clear he has some differences with the pope but liked that he is  injecting a moral consequence into the economy. Sanders, who is Jewish, is married to Catholic Jane O Meara Sanders.

The senator went on to jokingly say that,  you know, people say Bernie Sanders is radical   read what the pope is writing. Via: Daily Caller Meanwhile back in Pope Frances  home country of Argentina, economic crises besiege them with the regularity of earthquakes over a tectonic plate. These crises can be devastating, wiping out family savings, employment and life plans. It seems we re always recovering from or preparing for some sort of economic shock. Sometimes, our survival strategies can even contribute to the subsequent crisis.Last month Argentine voters very narrowly opted for a political sea change, voting out the Peronist faction led by Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (she and her deceased husband governed the country for the last 12 years) and electing the conservative mayor of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, to replace her.The business-friendly president-elect ran in opposition to a government that has been highly divisive, defined by extensive social spending and statist economic policies that antagonized large business interests and foreign investors. Kirchner leaves office with a high approval rating of about 50 percent, thanks to popular policies such as a per-child conditional cash transfer policy for poor families and a focus on human rights, such as gay marriage. But the economy is stagnant, annual inflation is around 25 percent, and the fiscal deficit could amount to an alarming 6 percent of the country s GDP this year.President-elect Macri has promised to shock the highly regulated economy into market-based reality. One element of his approach will be the elimination of strict currency controls put in place to prevent capital flight. The cost could be a devaluation of up to 60 percent. Economists, like gym gurus, always seem to argue that a bright future can only be attained with short-term pain.The government s official exchange rate allows you to buy a dollar for about 9.6 pesos. But since 2011, access to dollars has been highly limited in an attempt to keep people and companies from taking money out of the country.U.S. dollars, with the enduring value they represent, are the holy financial grail. From small wads stuffed under a mattress to a security box filled with piles of cash, dollars are the gold standard for Argentines. Dollars are perceived as the objective measure of value   to the point where property, perceived to have enduring value of its own, is priced in dollars.Via: Huffington Post","MY POPE JUST INVITED A RADICAL, Pro-Abortion Socialist Named Bernie To The Vatican…Should Conservative Catholics Be Outraged?"

"Apr 9, 2015"," If you have a system that rewards you for being a victim, it s subject to abuse.  Sheriff Donny YoungbloodThat kind of stance has won him enemies in California s immigrant-rights movement and frequent comparisons to Joe Arpaio, the brash Arizona sheriff notorious for his workplace raids and ID checks.Youngblood, 64, said he isn t trying to make headlines. The Vietnam War veteran, who grew up working in the potato sheds around Bakersfield, said he s happier hiking or riding his quarter horse, Sparky.He lives in the same modest suburban neighborhood where he grew up, on Bakersfield s now heavily Latino Eastside, and bristles at accusations that his policies encourage racial profiling, pointing out that a third of his deputies are Latino.As he drove through town on a recent morning, past oil derricks, gated golf courses and strip malls lined with Mexican restaurants and carnicerias, Youngblood outlined his philosophy on immigration.The federal government should start enforcing immigration laws   or write new ones, he said. He criticized President Obama s new deportation policies, which say most immigrants who have not committed serious crimes and have fewer than three minor crimes on their records should not be priorities for removal. You re in this country illegally and we re going to give you three bites of the apple? That s three victims!  Youngblood said.  If you commit crimes, you oughta go. Youngblood s defiant views have made him a rare voice of dissent in what has become the nation s most welcoming state for people in the country illegally.At a time when the Democrat-controlled Legislature has moved to allow such immigrants to drive, practice law and pay in-state college tuition   passing 26 immigrant-friendly laws last year alone, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures   Youngblood is an outlier.He has largely refused to sign paperwork that immigrant crime victims need to apply for U visas, which allow some victims to stay in the country lawfully. As president of the Major County Sheriffs  Assn., a national advocacy group, he has asked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to share data with police so patrol officers can determine whether the person they stop may be in the country illegally.Youngblood said his department began following the Trust Act last year on the advice of county attorneys. But he said he reserves the right to violate it. If ICE calls me and says,  You have someone there who has committed this heinous crime, and we really need you to hold them,  I m probably going to hold them,  he said.Youngblood s approach has been celebrated by those who believe, as he does, that Obama has been too lax on immigration enforcement.And it has made him the target of activists who accuse him of setting his own immigration policy and of sowing fear among the estimated 66,000 immigrants in this rural county illegally. People are scared,  said Lorena Lara, an immigrant who was brought to the country illegally by her farmworker father and who now works for a community organizing group called Faith in Action Kern County.  They re afraid to call the police because they think they might be deported. Immigrant advocates have been pushing for more protections and political representation in the Central Valley since Cesar Chavez launched the modern immigrant-rights movement in the grape fields here half a century ago. In recent years, Kern County has been the scene of tense standoffs between protesters on opposing sides of the immigration debate, including a well-publicized shouting match outside the Bakersfield office of Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy in 2013.The majority of Kern County residents are Latino, but it wasn t until the 1990s that a Latino was elected to the Bakersfield City Council or the Kern County Board of Supervisors. (Political scientists point out that Latinos make up only about a third of registered voters and tend to turn out for elections at much lower rates than their white counterparts.)Youngblood says his views are in line with the conservative voters who have put him in office three times since 2006. Their ideas about immigration and government couldn t be more different than the electorate in Los Angeles, he added, even though Kern borders Los Angeles County. We are right-of-the-center on things,  he said.  I always say Kern is a county that ought to be in Arizona. Not far from Youngblood s home, Jose and his wife live in a run-down gray bungalow. There s a large portrait of the Virgin of Guadalupe in the living room and a dirt yard out front. On a recent evening, as the couple cleaned up after a long day in the fields, a locomotive screeched on nearby tracks.The couple came here from Mexico nine years ago to find work. Jose, who didn t want to give his full name because he said he fears retaliation from the sheriff, now earns $9 an hour picking almonds and oranges. He made $9 a day as a bus driver back home.Jose said that in 2013 he and his wife were attacked by armed robbers while they slept. The thieves stole everything of value and beat Jose for an hour, shattering his ribs.Organizers with the United Farm Workers encouraged Jose to apply for a U visa, saying he had a slam-dunk case. The crime was sufficiently severe, they said, and he had cooperated with the sheriff s deputies who responded to the 911 call.To apply for the visa, immigrants must present a declaration from the law enforcement agency that investigated the crime saying that they were or will be helpful.The Bakersfield Police Department, like most agencies in the nation, has a policy of signing all U visa declarations. Youngblood doesn t.Out of 160 requests between 2012 and 2014, he signed just four, according to Sheriff s Department records. I think he has something personal against Latinos,  said Jose, who prays that Youngblood  will find it in his heart to reconsider. We are at his mercy,  he said.Youngblood said he hasn t signed most declarations because he doesn t believe in the premise of the law. If you have a system that rewards you for being a victim, it s subject to abuse,  he said.The sheriff s stance has won him supporters, such as Ellen Fluhart, 70, a retired rancher who lives in the northeastern part of the county. She said Youngblood s decision not to sign U visa petitions  is his prerogative. Fluhart said Youngblood s views are refreshing in a state where politicians have passed bills that she says encourage unlawful immigration. They broke the law,  Fluhart said.  They shouldn t be rewarded. Tensions between law enforcement and immigrant laborers in this community go back decades, said Gonzalo Santos, a sociologist at Cal State Bakersfield. In the 1930s, sheriff s officials deputized farm owners so they could use their badges to shut down labor protests, Santos said. Some farmworkers were killed.Now the department is intervening in immigration matters, said Santos, who called Youngblood  a rogue sheriff. Youngblood argues that Brown and the Legislature were interfering when they passed the Trust Act. Conflicting state and federal mandates put sheriffs like him  in the crosshairs,  he said. It s unfair, because the law is so unclear,  Youngblood said.  Really what we re looking for is clear law, clear direction.

"Apr 9, 2016","Close your eyes and imagine a white professor telling his students there will be no peace as long as  blackness  exists. Now picture that teacher in the unemployment line with about 100 cameras and reporters around him demanding he apologize for his blatant racism. Imagine how many hard working parents are scrimping and saving to send their children to college to be part of a captive audience in this racist s classroom. Parents better start speaking up and demanding these colleges and universities hold these radical, racist professors accountable for the things they are  teaching  our children. No one else is going to do it for us James Harrison, history professor at Portland Community College, said in a lecture Monday for the college s April Whiteness History Month that peace in the U.S. is impossible so long as whiteness still exists.In a talk entitled  Imagine A World Without Whiteness,  Harrison declared confidently conflict can only cease once the power structure of whiteness is totally eliminated. Imagine everyone living life in peace,  Harrison said, building off John Lennon s famous song  Imagine. And how do we get to that good world is the question   a world without conflict. And to me, my interpretation of these words, is it would be a world, or U.S., without whiteness, in terms of the power structure,  Harrison said, offering his own interpretation of Lennon s song. Can there be a world without whiteness, a world in which white privilege doesn t exist?  Harrison asked his audience. My answer is yes, we can, because it s happened before, and it all revolves around individuals taking small steps to dismantle and demolish the whole concept.  The effort is working. Harrison said whiteness is on the retreat, noting estimates indicate whites will no longer be a majority in the United States by 2040 or 2050.But do poor whites have white privilege? Harrison answered in the affirmative. Most whites, even poor whites, he said, don t recognize they have white privilege because it s invisible. It s like a club you belong to without asking to be part of it, Harrison said.Via: Daily Caller",COLLEGE PROFESSOR CAUGHT ON TAPE: You Can’t Have Peace If ‘Whiteness’ Exists…Poor Whites Also Have ‘Privilege”
"Apr 9, 2017","The U.S. bombardment of a Syrian airbase just outside of Homs Friday was likely seen by North Korea as a clear warning that President Trump will use his military if United States interests are at risk.The immediate focus after the strikes was on Russia s Vladimir Putin s reaction. Russia was not happy with the U.S., it spoke in defense of Syria and moved warships. But now the attention is on the next move by another world leader: Kim Jong-Un.Gordon Chang, a Daily Beast columnist and author of  Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On The World,  said in an emailed statement to Fox News Friday that the U.S. strike on the Syrian airfield  tells North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un that he must now heed American military power, something that he probably dismissed before. Kim s father, Kim Jong Il, disappeared from public view for about six weeks in 2003 at the time of the Iraq war. Kim Jong-Un loves the public spotlight, and it will be telling if he similarly goes into hiding,  the author said.   FOX NewsBREAKING: A U.S. Navy strike group will be moving toward the western Pacific Ocean near the Korean peninsula as a show of force, a U.S. official told Reuters on Saturday, as concerns grow about North Korea s advancing weapons program.Earlier this month North Korea tested a liquid-fueled Scud missile which only traveled a fraction of its range.The strike group, called Carl Vinson, includes an aircraft carrier and will make its way from Singapore toward the Korean peninsula, according to the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media and requested anonymity. We feel the increased presence is necessary,  the official said, citing North Korea s worrisome behavior.The news was first reported by Reuters.In a statement late Saturday, the U.S. Navy s Third Fleet said the strike group had been directed to sail north, but it did not specify the destination. The military vessels will operate in the Western Pacific rather than making previously planned port visits to Australia, it added.This year North Korean officials, including leader Kim Jong Un, have repeatedly indicated an intercontinental ballistic missile test or something similar could be coming, possibly as soon as April 15, the 105th birthday of North Korea s founding president and celebrated annually as  the Day of the Sun.

"Aug 1, 2015","Judge William H. Orrick, III joins Obama in his desire to keep the Planned parenthood abortion videos from coming out. He quickly granted a restraining order against the release of the videos. Did anyone else think it was really fast and very unusual that a judge would take such swift action? Well, we thought so too and now we know why. Orrick is an Obama appointee and was a bundler for the Obama campaign!A federal judge late Friday granted a temporary restraining order against the release of recordings made at an annual meeting of abortion providers. The injunction is against the Center for Medical Progress, the group that has unveiled Planned Parenthood s participation in the sale of organs harvested from aborted children.Judge William H. Orrick, III, granted the injunction just hours after the order was requested by the National Abortion Federation.Orrick was nominated to his position by hardline abortion supporter President Barack Obama. He was also a major donor to and bundler for President Obama s presidential campaign. He raised at least $200,000 for Obama and donated $30,800 to committees supporting him, according to Public Citizen.Even though the National Abortion Federation filed its claim only hours before, Orrick quickly decided in their favor that the abortionists they represent would, ironically, be  likely to suffer irreparable injury, absent an ex parte temporary restraining order, in the form of harassment, intimidation, violence, invasion of privacy, and injury to reputation, and the requested relief is in the public interest.

Please see our previous report after the update below.Three Square Market has received international attention since it announced the voluntary microchip program, believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.The microchip program is voluntary. If willing, employees allow the company to implant a Radio-Frequency Identification chip between the thumb and forefinger.The RFID chip will open doors, log in to computers, and make purchases from vending machines. The technology is similar to mobile pay services like Apple Pay and Google Wallet.Three Square Market assures employees that they will not be able to track them because the chip does not have GPS. Data on the microchip is encrypted.The company says the chip is FDA approved. It is removed  similar to a splinter. A reporter from our Milwaukee partner station WISN is covering the  chip party.

A company in Wisconsin is about to become the first in the US to offer microchip implants to its employees. It s the next thing that s inevitably going to happen, and we want to be a part of it,  Three Square Market Chief Executive Officer Todd Westby told KTSP.The company designs software for electronic break room markets, are commonly found in office complexes.People are currently able to purchase items at the market using phones, but Westby wants to take things a step further and implant a microchip inside a person s hand. We ll come up, scan the item,  he explained, while showing how the process will work at an actual break room market kiosk.  We ll hit pay with a credit card, and it s asking to swipe my proximity payment now. I ll hold my hand up, just like my cell phone, and it ll pay for my product. More than 50 employees are having the devices implanted starting next week. Each chip, which is implanted between a person s thumb and forefinger, is about the size of a single grain of rice.Along with purchasing market kiosk items, employees will be able to use the chip to get into the front door and log onto their computers.Each chip costs $300, but the company is eating the cost. They re implanted between a person s thumb and forefinger.Westby added the data is both encrypted and secure.* There s no GPS tracking at all,  he said.FORTUNE reported:The company is working with Biohax International, a Swedish company specializing in  smart biometric sensors.

"Aug 10, 2016","For anyone who thinks Trump s comments have crossed over the line, perhaps they ve forgotten about the Obama supported  Arab Spring  in Egypt that resulted in the violent overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak who was replaced by the radical Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi. And that s just one example Donald Trump accused President Barack Obama on Wednesday of founding the Islamic State group that is wreaking havoc from the Middle East to European cities. A moment later, on another topic, he referred to the president by his full legal name: Barack Hussein Obama. In many respects, you know, they honor President Obama,  Trump said during a raucous campaign rally outside Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  He is the founder of ISIS. He repeated the allegation three more times for emphasis.The Republican presidential nominee in the past has accused his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, of founding the militant group. As he shifted the blame to Obama on Wednesday, he said  crooked Hillary Clinton  was actually the group s co-founder.Trump has long blamed Obama and his former secretary of state   Clinton   for pursuing Mideast policies that created a power vacuum in Iraq that was exploited by IS, another acronym for the group. He s sharply criticized Obama for announcing he would pull U.S. troops out of Iraq, a decision that many Obama critics say created the kind of instability in which extremist groups like IS thrive.The White House declined to comment on Trump s accusation.The Islamic State group began as Iraq s local affiliate of al-Qaida, the group that attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. The group carried out massive attacks against Iraq s Shiite Muslim majority, fueling tensions with al-Qaida s central leadership. The local group s then-leader, Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in 2006 in a U.S. airstrike but is still seen as the Islamic State group s founder.Trump s accusation   and his use of the president s middle name, Hussein   echoed previous instances where he s questioned Obama s loyalties.In June, when a shooter who claimed allegiance to IS killed 49 people in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub, Trump seemed to suggest Obama was sympathetic to the group when he said Obama  doesn t get it, or he gets it better than anybody understands.  In the past, Trump has also falsely suggested Obama is a Muslim or was born in Kenya, where Obama s father was from.

"Aug 10, 2017","Great news! Southern Methodist University in Texas has reversed its decision to relocate an annual 9/11 memorial display made up of nearly 3,000 American flags to a less prominent part of campus after facing backlash from student groups.A huge thank you to The Young Americans for Freedom group! They had a hand in making this happen! They also were the ones who had set up the tribute honoring the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on SMU s Dallas Hall Lawn every year since 2010.But in July officials informed the group to move the display to Morrison-McGinnis Park because Dallas Hall Lawn is used for classes and a variety of events, said university spokesman Kent Best.SMU officials also had adopted a policy to ensure displays didn t include  harmful or triggering  messages, but they later removed the language from the then-policy as inappropriate. By that time, though, some student groups said the new policy was an attack on free speech. I don t believe it s the responsibility of the university to shield individuals from certain ideas that they might be offended by,  said Grant Wolf, the leader of the Young Americans for Freedom group, according to Dallas News. Wolf, along with other leaders from campus groups, sent a letter to university President R. Gerald Turner to express their frustration with the policy.  People absolutely have to have a right to their own opinions, but this does not come with a right to be shielded from opposing ideas, especially in an environment dedicated to the learning, sharing and developing of new ideas,  they wrote.They decried the relocation of the memorial. Moving the 9/11 memorial to an out of the way park is almost the same as not allowing it, said Heather Hall, president of the university s Turning Point USA chapter.  That s not free speech,  Hall said.  That s not American. That s definitely not what SMU stands for.   Read more:  Daily MailOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS BAN: The shocker about this is that students on both sides of the political spectrum want the 9/11 flags to be displayed where they ve always been displayed. The inability of college campuses to stand up to people who are perpetually offended is a sad statement on where we are in American tolerance these days. It s so ironic that the left wants you to march to their drum beat or else they will destroy you. Note to SMU: You had a good thing going with your student body coming together to memorialize 9/11 so let it continue!DALLAS, Tex.   In a time of extreme political divide, students both Republican and Democrat at one Texas college have found something they can agree on.For the past two years at Southern Methodist University, a campus group has planted thousands of American flags in front of Dallas Hall as a memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. That s simply contradictory to the very definition of free speech,  said Grant Wolf, the Young Americans for Freedom Chairman.But in July, SMU changed its policy, saying student groups can no longer have displays there.The lawn has historically hosted tributes and protests from students of all political affiliations. The leaders of two prominent student groups say the policy violates their right to free speech. They re basically cornering us into a segment of campus and saying you re not allowed to have a display here because it s triggering, harmful or offensive to students over there,  said Drew Wicker, the President of SMU College Republicans.SMU released a statement saying nearby Momac Park, where displays will be allowed, is larger than the lawn and is along one of the most prominent drives on campus.The university said it  respects the rights of all campus community members to express their opinions, as well as their right to be free from coercion or harassment.

We certainly understand the position the league takes on this, but it won t diminish our support for that concept of unity and supporting our police force and what they do to make our lives better on a daily basis,  coach Jason Garrett said.  That arm-in-arm image is something that we really believe in. You heard me talk about it a couple weeks back. What we re trying to do as a football team is build a team that s close. We talk a lot about unity and having each other s backs, and certainly they embody that. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has this to say about the decal controversy:Tight end Jason Witten spearheaded the idea of the players honoring the police and the families. While a little disappointed, Witten believes the gesture at the start of camp can have a long-lasting impact. What s really important is what we tried to do, and that s to unite that community, our community, and show that support for those families and really honor the leadership of our city,  Witten said.  I think that decal not being on the helmet is not going to stop that. It s going to continue to do that not only now but in the future as we move forward. As players and an organization that is something we re going to continue to support.    ESPNWe reported about Cleveland Brown s player, Isaiah Crowell s Instagram post on July 11, 2016.

He posted it on Wednesday   after Alton Sterling and Philando Castile s deaths, but the day before 5 Dallas officers were shot and killed. The running back deleted the post and the Browns demanded he publicly apologize, which he did.But Stephen Loomis, President of Cleveland Police Patrolmen s Association, thinks the  store-bought apology  isn t enough.  He needs to go to Dallas, help the families who lost their loved ones last week, write them a check, look them in the eyes and give a heartfelt apology. Loomis says Crowell s post was as  offensive as putting a picture of historical African-American men being hung from a tree in the 60s.  He adds that if Crowell doesn t go to Dallas and make a donation,  I will pull Cleveland officers, sheriffs, state troopers out of First Energy Stadium this season if he doesn t make it right.

Read below and let us know if you agree that the ACLU is protecting people who should have no rights in America.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a class action lawsuit against President Trump s administration over the detention of immigrant teenagers for  unsubstantiated claims of gang affiliation. The lawsuit, announced on Friday, targets Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Health and Human Services  Office of Refugee Resettlement.In a press release, the ACLU accuses ICE and the Office of Refugee Resettlement of detaining children and transporting them to detention facilities without notifying their parents or lawyers.The organization also alleges that ICE is detaining and deporting the immigrant teens  under the guise of a  crackdown  on transnational street gangs  and accuses the federal agency of making arrests based on  unreliable claims of gang affiliation and flawed reports of criminal history.   We re talking about teens who were picked up for play-fighting with a friend, or for showing pride in their home country of El Salvador,  Stephen Kang, an attorney with the ACLU Immigrants  Rights Project, said in the release.  The Office of Refugee Resettlement is accepting wholesale that young immigrants should be kept behind bars because of what they look like or where they come from. The lead plaintiffs in the case are from Suffolk County in Long Island, N.Y.In May, ICE announced it has arrested more than 1,300 people in a crackdown on gangs. Three of those arrested had Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals paperwork protecting them from deportation, according to a report at the time by The Washington Post.The crackdown on gangs coupled with the Trump administration s tough stance on legal and illegal immigration has raised alarms among activists that people with tenuous connections to gangs could come under unfair scrutiny.Fox News reported a surge in people seeking to remove tattoos that people believed could be used by ICE to link them to gangs.The ACLU class action lawsuit seeks the release of the teens who are the plaintiffs in the case as well as an injunction to prevent the government from further detaining immigrant children without cause.The ACLU has launched numerous lawsuits against Trump s administration since he took office, suing over Trump s travel ban and challenging the legality of his voter fraud commission.WHO IS THE ACLU PROTECTING?

The total price for flight expenditures alone came to $1,164,268.80.It has been reported that the Obamas have made a point of contributing to the cost of these taxpayer-funded trips, and have reportedly paid for the rental costs of the estate in the past.

"Aug 13, 2016","Hillary Clinton tells about funding the terrorists who would help defeat the Russians   most of this is true but in typical Hillary fashion she changes the story and doesn t mention Reagan s Strategic Defense Initiative. The SDI aka  Star Wars  was a big part in the defeat as well. You can guarantee you ll never see this video clip on the main stream media! During the 1970 s the CIA used the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt as a barrier, both to thwart Soviet expansion and prevent the spread of Marxist ideology among the Arab masses. The United States also openly supported Sarekat Islam against Sukarno in Indonesia, and supported the Jamaat-e-Islami terror group against Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in Pakistan. Last but certainly not least, there is Al Qaeda.Lest we forget, the CIA gave birth to Osama Bin Laden and breastfed his organization during the 1980 s. Former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, told the House of Commons that Al Qaeda was unquestionably a product of Western intelligence agencies. Mr. Cook explained that Al Qaeda, which literally means an abbreviation of  the database  in Arabic, was originally the computer database of the thousands of Islamist extremists, who were trained by the CIA and funded by the Saudis, in order to defeat the Russians in Afghanistan.America s relationship with Al Qaeda has always been a love-hate affair. Depending on whether a particular Al Qaeda terrorist group in a given region furthers American interests or not, the U.S. State Department either funds or aggressively targets that terrorist group. Even as American foreign policy makers claim to oppose Muslim extremism, they knowingly foment it as a weapon of foreign policy.The Islamic State is its latest weapon that, much like Al Qaeda, is certainly backfiring. ISIS recently rose to international prominence after its thugs began beheading American journalists. Now the terrorist group controls an area the size of the United Kingdom.In order to understand why the Islamic State has grown and flourished so quickly, one has to take a look at the organization s American-backed roots. The 2003 American invasion and occupation of Iraq created the pre-conditions for radical Sunni groups, like ISIS, to take root. America, rather unwisely, destroyed Saddam Hussein s secular state machinery and replaced it with a predominantly Shiite administration. The U.S. occupation caused vast unemployment in Sunni areas, by rejecting socialism and closing down factories in the naive hope that the magical hand of the free market would create jobs.FLASHBACK: Hillary Clinton Received Secret Memo Stating Obama Admin Support for ISISUnder the new U.S.-backed Shiite regime, working class Sunni s lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. Unlike the white Afrikaners in South Africa, who were allowed to keep their wealth after regime change, upper class Sunni s were systematically dispossessed of their assets and lost their political influence. Rather than promoting religious integration and unity, American policy in Iraq exacerbated sectarian divisions and created a fertile breading ground for Sunni discontent, from which Al Qaeda in Iraq took root.The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) used to have a different name: Al Qaeda in Iraq. After 2010 the group rebranded and refocused its efforts on Syria.Via: GR",WOW! HILLARY SPILLS THE BEANS On Funding Terrorists…The Press Is Silent [Video]
"Aug 13, 2017","Following the situation in Charlottesville, Trump was one of the very few people to call out all sides for displays of violence and bigotry: white supremacists, black supremacists, Communists, and Antifa. In short, this flurry of frustration was far from one-sided.Amidst all of the chaos, David Duke tried to link Trump to the bigotry and violence that was present in Charlottesville. This is certainly interesting considering the fact that Trump called Duke out on his own bigotry nearly seventeen years ago. In an interview with Matt Lauer in 2000, Trump condemned Duke while being questioned about his reasons for dropping out of the Reform Party primary.Trump attributed the party s  self-destructing  nature to the people involved with it, specifically Duke. When pressed on this matter by Lauer, Trump responded,  Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party.

Way to honor our troops who have lost their lives to these evil men Barry President Barack Obama s multi-agency Periodic Review Board (PRB) has approved an al Qaeda-linked Algerian prisoner for release from the U.S. military detention center in Guant namo Bay, Cuba, conceding that the jihadist  presents some level of threat. However, PRB claims that the threat posed by the 43-year-old, Sufiyan Barhoumi, can be  adequately mitigated,  in part due to  his lack of extremist views. At one point, the Pentagon deemed the prisoner to be  high risk,  linked to key al Qaeda leadership, and accused him of participating in  hostilities against the US and coalition forces. Barhoumi was identified by the Pentagon as an explosive s expert and Al-Qaeda trainer.He has been held at Guant namo since mid June 2002 and on Tuesday became the second detainee to be approved for release by the Gitmo board after presenting a letter of support from a former guard, notes the Miami Herald.In a statement announcing its latest decision, Obama s parole board notes:The Board recommends repatriation to Algeria due to the detainees strong family support and Algeria s strong record in prior transfers, with security appropriate security assurances as negotiated by the Special Envoys and agreed by relevant USG [US government] departments and agencies.Algeria has been listed by the U.S. government as a terrorism-linked country.Barhoumi presented PRB with a detailed plan to open a pizza shop near his mom in the Algerian capital of Algiers, reports the Miami Herald.For entire story: Breitbart News","OBAMA’S GITMO BOARD RELEASES “High Risk” Explosive’s Expert, Al-Qaeda Trainer"

"Aug 15, 2015","Obama is hell bent on closing GITMO before he leaves office even if it s the wrong move. His legacy comes before what s right for all Americans and he s got a couple Senators really peeved. Obama s latest plan is to move GITMO to South Carolina and Kansas. You guessed it, the Senators from those two states are not having any of it! Remember when Obama tried this 7 years ago? It didn t go over well then but it seems desperation has kicked in and he s trying to dump the GITMO prisoners in states again. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Pat Roberts of Kansas are up in arms about reports that the Pentagon is scouting sites in their home states to house terrorist prisoners currently detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We have received reports of President Obama s attempt to shut down Guantanamo Bay, which once again reflects another egregious overstep by this administration,  Roberts said in a statement on Friday, referring to the law preventing transferring any of the inmates to a U.S. prison. Congress has consistently stopped Obama by law from moving a single detainee to the U.S.,  Roberts said in reaction to reports that Kansas s Fort Leavenworth is being considered as the terrorist suspects  new home. I shut down this administration s nominee for secretary of the Army in 2009 to prevent moving any detainees to Kansas and will do it again if necessary,  he said.  Not on my watch will any terrorist be placed in Kansas. Graham was equally emphatic upon learning that Defense Secretary Ash Carter is also considering Charleston for the new high-risk installation. If the detainees need to be moved, they must be moved to a maximum security location in a remote area far from heavily populated areas with vital infrastructure,  Graham told the Washington Post earlier this week.  Charleston does not meet that criteria. The Pentagon on Thursday confirmed to lawmakers that it is studying both Forth Leavenworth and the Consolidated Naval Brig in Charleston as potential sites.Via: WE ",SENATORS UP IN ARMS OVER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO MOVE GITMO TO TWO DIFFERENT STATES

Could you imagine the feeding frenzy by the media would have had if Bush declared a state of emergency and then went golfing? The media s double standard for our Organizer In Chief compared to the criticism of GW Bush is beyond the pale President Barack Obama declared Louisiana was in a state of disaster on Sunday after a historic flood left at least five people dead, with emergency crews working to rescue thousands more. Governor John Bel Edwards said more than 10,000 people are now in shelters and more than 20,000 people have been rescued across south Louisiana.More than a foot of rain fell overnight on Friday   in a deluge estimated to occur once every 500 years, according to the Pacific Standard.In shocking photos showing the devastation, caskets that had washed up from a graveyard floated down the street in Denham Springs, Louisiana.Four people have been reported dead, said Devin George, the state registrar for vital records, earlier Sunday.A woman s body was later recovered by divers from inside a flooded vehicle in East Baton Rouge Parish, appearing to raise the death toll to five.Witnesses said the woman was seen Saturday night attempting to turn around in high water when her vehicle was swept away, said Casey Rayborn Hicks, a spokeswoman for the sheriff s office.In one dramatic rescue Saturday, two men on a boat pulled a woman from a car that was almost completely underwater, according to video by WAFB.Watch video of dramatic rescue HERE.The woman, who s not initially visible on camera, yells from inside the car:  Oh my god, I m drowning.

"Aug 16, 2015","Remember the promise of a fence on our southern border? Yes, it was the plan but the $1.2 billion dollar plan was never executed as proposed. You can thank Obama and a popular Republican for that WE RECENTLY POSTED THIS VIDEO OF AN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL SAYING BUILDING A BORDER FENCE  ISN T POSSIBLE  EVEN THOUGH $1.2 BILLION WAS GIVEN IN 2006 FOR A FENCE:  In his speech in El Paso on immigration reform on May 10, 2011, Obama declared that the fence along the border with Mexico is  now basically complete.  Like much of what comes out of the Obama administration, that was a lie. What was supposed to be built was a double layered fence with barbed-wire on top, and room for a security vehicle to patrol between the layers. Except for 36 of the seven-hundred mile fence, what was built looks like the picture above or the one below.OBAMA CLAIMED: We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement,  Obama said.  All the stuff they asked for, we ve done. But even though we ve answered these concerns, I ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time. Maybe he s right the goal posts were moved, but to make the job easier.THE  SECURE FENCE ACT The Secure Fence Act was introduced on Sept. 13, 2006 by Rep Peter King (R-NY) and passed Congress on a bi-partisan basis. In the House of Representatives, the Fence Act passed 283 -138 on September 14, 2006. On September 29, 2006, the Fence Act passed in the Senate 80 -19. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 s goal was to help secure America s borders to decrease illegal entry, drug trafficking, and security threats by building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers along the Mexico-United States border. Additionally, the law authorized more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting as well as authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology such as cameras, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce infrastructure at the border. So far less than 40 miles of a real fence have been built   most of it during the Bush Administration.Of the almost 700 miles of fencing, DHS reports there are currently 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing, as the bill required, the kind with enough gap that you can drive a vehicle between the layers. But the majority of the fencing erected has been made from vehicle barriers with single-layer pedestrian fencing, the kind of barriers that are designed to stop vehicles rather than people. The design specifications vary, depending on geography and climate characteristics, but according to the Customs and Border Patrol website, those include  post on rail  steel set in concrete; steel picket-style fence set in concrete; vehicle bollards similar to those found around federal buildings;  Normandy; vehicle fence consisting of steel beams; and concrete jersey walls with steel mesh.PROMINENT REPUBLICAN FROM TEXAS:The first blow against the promised fence was made by Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican Senator from Texas, at the urging of DHS she proposed an amendment to give the Department discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read,  Nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.  Hutchison s amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007 despite the fact that Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., had a cow he argued the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill, he was right. Hutchison s intentions may have been honorable, but she didn t foresee Barack Obama being the next president.When Janet Napolitano became Obama s first DHS she took advantage of Ms. Hutchison s 2007 amendment, instead of building a fence which look something like the below, she built a fence that was mostly a combination of the two pictures above.When She was still Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano said,  You show me a 50-foot wall, and I ll show you a 51-foot ladder at the border. And she may be right The fence will never STOP all illegal crossings. The purpose of the fence is two-fold, slowing the intruders and making them visible to members of the border patrol. The rest of the work is done by human beings.Very little of the Israeli separation barrier erected to keep out terrorists is a wall, most of the 400 miles of the barrier which has received so much international scorn is a two layered fence like section of their barrier below. The fence has served its purpose, in 2002, the year before construction started, 457 Israelis were murdered; in 2009, 8 Israelis were killed.The reason it has been effective is not simply the fence itself but how the fence is guarded and patrolled. And that s what will make our fence along the Mexican border work.Here s the bottom line. Back in 2006 the people of the U.S. were promised a border fence. Since then thanks to Kay Bailey Hutchison and Barack Obama 95% of the fence wasn t built. The arguments against the fence are bogus especially if you look at Israel s history. It s time for America to demand that its leaders build the fence they promised. No one can honestly say it wont work, after all it hasn t been tried.

Oh yeah that was Bill Clinton who was actually IMPEACHED for LYING to a grand jury. Is there a more corrupt, self-serving power-driven couple in America?  WASHINGTON, D.C. Today, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (UT-03) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (VA-06) sent a letter to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia requesting an investigation into whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton committed perjury and made false statements when testifying under oath before Congress.The letter states: The evidence collected by the FBI during its investigation of Secretary Clinton s use of a personal email system appears to directly contradict several aspects of her sworn testimony. In light of those contradictions, the Department should investigate and determine whether to prosecute Secretary Clinton for violating statutes that prohibit perjury and false statements to Congress, or any other relevant statutes. Background:During a July 5, 2016 hearing before the House Oversight Committee, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey stated the truthfulness of Secretary Clinton s testimony before Congress was not within the scope of the FBI s investigation.

Someone might think one thing is a symbol of hate but not another. Where does this purging end?Mayor de Blasio said late Wednesday that the city will conduct a 90-day review of  all symbols of hate on city property  in the wake of violence sparked by white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend.A 32-year-old woman was killed and more than a dozen people were injured when a vehicle slammed into a group of counter-protesters on Saturday, and two state troopers died when the helicopter from which they were monitoring events suddenly crashed.Opposition to the removal of a statue of Confederate Army general Robert E.

"Aug 17, 2015","This is another twist and turn in the mega scandal that is all Hillary s mess. The interesting thing about this e-mail discovery is that Philippe Reines had been battling with reporters in March via e-mail regarding guilt or innocence in this e-mail scandal:A key member of Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton s team sent several angry emails to a group of journalists on Tuesday night. The messages criticized a source for being a  lying liar  and what the aide described as a reporter s  cockamamie theory. Fast Forward to this new development: State Department officials have uncovered thousands of emails between Philippe Reines, a top Hillary Clinton aide, and members of the media, they previously said did not exist.In a court filing last Thursday, the State Department estimated that a recent search turned up more than 81,000 emails from Reines s official account while at the State Department. And 17,855 potentially fall within a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by Gawker earlier this year.That is a reversal from 2013, when the State Department said a thorough search turned up no responsive records for Gawker s request. In 2012, Gawker requested all emails between Reines and reporters from 34 media outlets.The State Department did not explain the reversal in the court document, nor did it return a request for comment.It will begin releasing a tranche of Reines s emails by the end of September.After it was revealed earlier this year that Clinton, and potentially some of her aides, used personal email accounts for official business, Gawker sued the State Department over its initial request for communications between Reines and reporters.Via: The Hill",OOPS!

"Aug 17, 2016","Vice Presidential candidate Tim Kaine has some explaining to do! It sure looks like he sold his soul to the Clintons to run as Vice President. He had a totally different view of Bill Clinton in 2002 and stated he thought Bill should have stepped down during the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. The lack of integrity and lack of respect for the office that Bill Clinton held should be enough for any Democrat to not want him anywhere near the White House again. Clinton shook his finger as he looked in the camera and LIED  to the American people about his disgusting affair with a White House intern. Does anyone care to recall that this was a HUGE DEAL AND NOW HIS ENABLING WIFE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT! This all seems so impossible but the press, globalists and Republican elitists are making it possible Do what you can to keep the Clinton Grifters out of the White House. America deserves better! TRUMP 2016!  How quickly Democrats forget! Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine is pretty much part of the Clinton family at this point. But in 2002, he said Bill Clinton should have stepped down in the wake of his affair with a White House intern.Bill Clinton should have resigned over the Monica Lewinsky scandal at least, that s a view Tim Kaine once held.Kaine s remark reported 14 years ago in the Richmond Times-Dispatch in the aftermath of a state-level sex scandal hasn t drawn any attention thus far in the 2016 presidential cycle. But it suggests Hillary Clinton s running mate at one point harbored reservations about the integrity of the man poised to become the country s first first gentleman.Kaine commented on the Lewinsky scandal in 2002, when allegations of sexual harassment had rocked the Virginia House of Delegates. The speaker of the house, Vance Wilkins, was a Republican power broker who had just helped his party flip the House and build its majority after Democrats had historically controlled the chamber.Just one problem: Earlier in 2001, Wilkins agreed to pay $100,000 in hush money to a former female employee at his construction company who said he sexually harassed her.The woman, Jennifer Thompson, alleged privately that Wilkins groped her and pinned her against office furniture. She considered pressing charges, according to a Washington Post report that broke the news on June 7, 2002. But she ultimately decided not to, accepting the $100,000 from Wilkins and signing a confidentiality agreement. The Post cited  sources familiar with the settlement  in their report on it. Wilkins held and still holds, as he stated in an interview with The Daily Beast that he didn t sexually harass Thompson, and that he only paid her to keep her allegations from becoming a scandal that would have undermined Republicans  efforts to control the House.The Post s report caused an immediate firestorm, and top Republicans called for Wilkins to resign. Jerry Kilgore, then the state s attorney general and top-ranking elected Republican, joined the chorus.So did Tim Kaine, who was the state s lieutenant governor at the time. And according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, he said he also believed Bill Clinton should have resigned from the presidency over his own sex scandals.Here s what the paper wrote, in a story published June 8, 2002: If the allegations are true, he should definitely resign,  Kaine said, adding he held the same view about President Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.  That is an intolerable way to treat women and it s not something that the state should be dragged through. The Times-Dispatch story is behind a paywall in its archive.A report in The Washington Post, also published on June 8, 2002, characterized his views the same way:Lt. Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D), who may face [state Attorney General Jerry] Kilgore in the 2005 governor s race, likened the matter to the sexual scandal of President Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, saying,  If the allegations are true, he ought to resign. Somebody in public life shouldn t behave that way toward women,  Kaine said.  It s tawdry. It s not the leadership that Virginia should have. An AP story that ran on the same day also highlighted Kaine s criticism of Bill Clinton. When I read it this morning, my reaction was the same I had when I read about the Clinton-Lewinsky affair: this is not appropriate conduct. It s beneath the dignity of the office,  he said.Amy Dudley, a spokesperson for Kaine, said the Virginia senator is focused on the future. As the Associated Press reported at the time, Kaine characterized President Clinton s actions as  not appropriate  conduct, but he had previously been on record criticizing the impeachment effort,  she said.  He believes this election is about Hillary Clinton s vision to make historic investments to create good paying jobs, make college debt free and build an economy that works for everyone, not re-litigating personal issues from the distant past. Wilkins told The Daily Beast that he didn t recall Kaine making the comment, but that he  didn t pay much attention to him anyway. He saw a political opportunity to make a political hit and he took it,  Wilkins added.  It doesn t surprise me at all. Kaine wasn t the only Democrat disturbed by Bill Clinton s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton s world-famous lie I did not have sexual relations with that woman became one of the definitive lines of the  90s. And their dalliances ultimately led to the House voting to impeach Clinton. Five House Democrats including Virginian Virgil Goode, who later became a Republican voted for some of the articles of impeachment. No Senate Democrats voted that Clinton was guilty.

"Aug 17, 2017","It is becoming increasingly difficult to separate leftists from Islamic terrorists as both destroy monuments, statues, and seek to eliminate freedoms we enjoy. On a day in which an Islamic terrorist killed over a dozen people in Barcelona, senior editor Wilber Cooper has the audacity to publish an article for VICE Magazine urging the left to destroy Mt. Rushmore just like ISIS would.In his article  Let s Blow Up Mount Rushmore,  Cooper attacks the Founding Fathers and calls for a demolition of the monument. His call to erase historical markers, such as statues, echoes the recent movement from left-wingers for a culture war that would decimate Americans  political traditions and heroes. Those targeted heroes include Thomas Jefferson, former president and chief author of the Bill of Rights   such as the First Amendment   and General and President George Washington, who declined offers to become a dictator after winning the Revolutionary War.Cooper argues that these historical monuments and statues help preserve a system of racial exploitation and inequality, and should be erased to help build a new society. He says,  It s going to be impossible to improve America if we can t be honest about its origins and its past. He insists that  Trump and his white supremacist cohorts believe the reverence some Americans have for these statues is simply respect for history, and that tearing them down is tantamount to ripping pages out of a textbook. But monuments built by the state are not history they are manifestations of power. Upon acknowledging the insensitivity of the article s title given the tragic events which occurred earlier today in Spain, VICE Magazine deleted the original article and wrote an editor s note:  The headline and URL of this story have been updated. We do not condone violence in any shape or form, and the use of  blow up  in the original headline as a rhetorical device was misguided and insensitive. We apologize for the error.

We sit here and talk about advancing the black agenda, whatever that means, we talk about our interests, and what s important to us   like having political power and advancement and all those things   and then we are turning around and we are killing our children,  Watson continued.  And we are buying the lie that it s our personal decision to make. Here s Hillary Clinton slamming Donald Trump over his defense of life and her willingness to destroy it at a Planned Parenthood event:The NFL star said he is sympathetic to the women who are struggling with an unplanned pregnancy. But Watson, a husband and father of five children, said many men are not stepping up to help their children and the women in their lives like they should. He urged men to take responsibility for their actions. He need to be there to support her through the physical changes of the pregnancy, and help and provide emotional strength, and do it together,  Watson continued.  As much as he has a role in making the baby in the first place, it needs to take both of them the whole way through. Sometimes, Watson said he does have the opportunity to talk with other NFL players about abortion and his pro-life convictions. Just like in almost any career setting, Watson said they talk about many different things, including politics and religion. You ve got guys that consider themselves Conservative and pro-life, and you ve got guys that consider themselves Liberal and pro-choice, and it kind of goes back and forth,  he said.  What I love is that in most of the situations I have been in, not all of them, but most, even if we sometimes talk abrasively to each other, we still have love for each other. Last year, after the Center for Medical Progress began releasing its undercover Planned Parenthood videos, Watson wasn t shy about speaking up for unborn babies either.He posted on his Facebook wall:As horrific as it is, the issue isn t really the sale of human parts. It s the legal practice that allows this to even be a possibility. Killing children and simply discarding the leftovers is not any more acceptable than profiting off of them. #PlannedParenthood  Asked if he has faced backlash for his stance, Watson told Turning Point,  I won t say I m not afraid, and I will say that I ve received some flack for some of the things I ve said   I decided that you know, if the spirit of God has prompted me to say something, I m gonna trust in God and say it.

Maybe he s not aware that we re dealing with a country who has an actual day set aside to celebrate their hate for America and Israel Iran s Quds Day: Death to America, Death to IsraelThe ritualistic rally cries of  Death to America  and  Death to Israel.   Quds Day has become a day in which Iran and protestors in other societies attack the legitimacy of the state of Israel ( The Little Satan ) and continue to threaten the United States ( The Big Satan ). Gatestone Institute An apparent draft of one of the secret side agreements to the Iran nuclear deal indicates that Tehran will be permitted to use its own experts to inspect the Parchin nuclear site believed to have housed nuclear arms development.The Associated Press obtained the document, which an anonymous official described as a draft of an agreement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that does not differ much from the final version. The IAEA is the U.N. agency responsible for ensuring that Tehran abides by the stipulations in the finalized deal.The secret agreements between Iran and the IAEA of which there are at least two have to do with the inspection of Iran s Parchin military facility as well as the extent to which Tehran must admit to the details of its alleged nuclear weapons program.Despite repeated calls from lawmakers, President Obama has refused to provide Congress with the details of the secret deals.The AP reports:Any IAEA member country must give the agency some insight into its nuclear program. Some countries are required to do no more than give a yearly accounting of the nuclear material they possess. But nations like Iran suspected of possible proliferation are under greater scrutiny that can include stringent inspections.But the agreement diverges from normal inspection procedures between the IAEA and a member country by essentially ceding the agency s investigative authority to Iran. It allows Tehran to employ its own experts and equipment in the search for evidence for activities that it has consistently denied trying to develop nuclear weapons.The document suggests that IAEA officials will merely monitor Iranian experts as they inspect the Parchin site and provide the U.N. agency with photos and videos taken only of areas that Iran has not deemed off-limits because of military implications.Iranian technicians are also to perform the sampling of weapons development work, which is limited to seven samples inside the facility building.In the face of criticism, the Obama administration has denied that the nuclear deal is built on the trust of the Iranians.Multiple GOP lawmakers have sounded the alarm regarding the secret agreements between Tehran and the IAEA, accusing Obama of violating the law by denying Congress access to the details of the side deals.Before the final deal was reached in Vienna, Obama signed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which requires congressional lawmakers view all documents of the nuclear agreement specifically including those reached on the  side.

"Aug 2, 2015","A transcript from the Friday, July 31, 2015 Rush Limbaugh show. Rush is truly one of the most brilliant political analysts of our time. He proves it with this commentary on Mitt Romney and Ted Cruz:RUSH: Mitt Romney is out there ripping into Ted Cruz, and I made the observation that I can t recall a presidential candidate   losing presidential candidate   ripping presidential candidates in his own party in the next election cycle. I was trying to think, in the modern era, if there was an example of it. I couldn t think of one. It wasn t so much trying to think of Reagan s 11th commandment as I was thinking more about establishment Republican versus upstart Tea Party conservative.By the way, here s another thing: I ve been doing  In the course of show prep, I ve been doing just a voluminous amount of reading about the divide here between the establishment in Washington, both parties, and the Republican Party, what s happening with Trump and so forth. Now, I knew! I knew that the Democrats had elevated the Tea Party into being something horrible and giant and bad, negative. I had no idea Eh, that s not quite true. I didn t fully appreciate the extent to which the Republican Party has enmity for the Tea Party. The Washington establishment treats the Tea Party  They re genuinely afraid of it. Let me put it this way: They re genuinely afraid of it because of its size and its power, and the amazing thing about that is the Tea Party is not something about which is organized around an individual. I think this is why they fear it. It is genuinely bottom-up.It s an effervescent movement of average, ordinary people fed up with Washington, just totally fed up with government, totally fed up with what government is doing. Peggy Noonan has a piece today, and she says that the Tea Party and others, it s not hatred for government they have, it s contempt for government. But the Tea Party is genuinely feared, and it s genuinely feared because it is thought to be huge, and it s put the whole Republican establishment on defense.So, anyway, Ted Cruz  isn t backing off the tough rhetoric he s used to describe the Iran nuclear deal, despite criticism leveled by  Mitt Romney yesterday. Cruz  fired back at Romney in a Thursday radio interview   So Mitt Romney s tweet today said,  Gosh, this rhetoric is not helpful,  Cruz said.  John Adams famously said,  Facts are stubborn things.  Describing the actual facts is not using rhetoric; it is called speaking the truth.'  Cruz then fired another fact. Part of the reason that Mitt Romney got clobbered by Barack Obama is because we all remember that third debate where Barack Obama turned to Mitt and said,  I said the Benghazi attack was terrorism and no one is more upset by Benghazi than I am!  And Mitt, I guess listening to his own advice, said,  Well gosh, I don t want to use any rhetoric. So OK, never mind. I ll just kind of rearrange the pencil on the podium here,  Cruz said.  And he s right! We do remember that debate.I mean, Romney must have had three, different, slow-pitch curveballs, softballs, just tailor made for grand-slam home runs, and he just didn t even take a swing at them. Remember that? After the first debate, when Romney just cleaned Obama s clock, do you remember that? The Democrats and the media were all asking,  What happened to Obama? Oh my God, does he even want to be reelected?  They were scared to death because Romney just made mincemeat.After that one, it was like it never happened, almost like Romney felt guilty for doing it. Because he went into a defensive mode and did not do anything else that might offend or upset or irritate anybody. And it was clear that the consultants had gotten hold of him. Maybe they didn t have to. Maybe he believed it himself. But the consultants had gotten a hold of him and said,  Look, you can t keep criticizing the president. The independents don t like that! We re never going to win. We have to show we can cooperate. We have to show we can work with the Democrats!  So Romney shut up. But what Cruz s point is very simple (summarized):  What are you beating up on me for? I m not the enemy. I m not the Democrat Party. Why don t you start talking about them this way? They re the ones actually doing a deal that s going to put this country at risk. Why don t you say that?  Effectively what Cruz is saying is,  I m not the problem here, Mitt! And this isn t  rhetoric.  I m simply citing facts. So now people are starting to ask:  Is Cruz following in the Trump mold? Is Trump serving to show the way for other Republicans how to respond?  Well, maybe Trump is, but Cruz doesn t need to be shown. This is standard operating procedure for Cruz. I mean, it was just two weeks ago that he went to the floor of the Senate and accused the majority leader of lying to him face to face. Now he s firing back at Romney. But try this headline. Well, it s not a headline. It s a paragraph subhead. Both Obama and Romney have called Cruz s remarks inappropriate.  What has Cruz done? He s  maintained that [Obama] would become a leading state-sponsor of terror if the agreement it struck with Iran makes it past Congress. He and others have argued that Iran would use a windfall from sanctions relief to finance terror abroad.  He has said on that basis alone this deal ought not get done! And then Romney piped up and said in a tweet (paraphrased):  Gosh, this rhetoric isn t helpful. Gosh, this rhetoric isn t helpful! Cruz fired back:  You re telling me what s not helpful? You got clobbered by Obama for a reason! You got clobbered because you backed off. You got clobbered because you didn t have the guts to keep going.  So this is  I like this, folks.

"Aug 2, 2016","US Congressman Joe Wilson was right! Obama is a liar His reckless and amateur decisions have made America more unsafe than we have ever been. Now he s asking Americans to vote for Hillary to ensure his lawless legacy lives on The Obama administration secretly organized an airlift of $400 million worth of cash to Iran that coincided with the January release of four Americans detained in Tehran, according to U.S. and European officials and congressional staff briefed on the operation afterward.Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said.The money represented the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a decades-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the 1979 fall of Iran s last monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.The settlement, which resolved claims before an international tribunal in The Hague, also coincided with the formal implementation that same weekend of the landmark nuclear agreement reached between Tehran, the U.S. and other global powers the summer before. With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well,  President Barack Obama said at the White House on Jan. 17 without disclosing the $400 million cash payment.Senior U.S. officials denied any link between the payment and the prisoner exchange. They say the way the various strands came together simultaneously was coincidental, not the result of any quid pro quo. As we ve made clear, the negotiations over the settlement of an outstanding claim were completely separate from the discussions about returning our American citizens home,  State Department spokesman John Kirby said.  Not only were the two negotiations separate, they were conducted by different teams on each side, including, in the case of The Hague claims, by technical experts involved in these negotiations for many years. But U.S. officials also acknowledge that Iranian negotiators on the prisoner exchange said they wanted the cash to show they had gained something tangible.Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and a fierce foe of the Iran nuclear deal, accused President Barack Obama of paying  a $1.7 billion ransom to the ayatollahs for U.S. hostages. This break with longstanding U.S. policy put a price on the head of Americans, and has led Iran to continue its illegal seizures  of Americans, he said.Since the cash shipment, the intelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guard has arrested two more Iranian-Americans. Tehran has also detained dual-nationals from France, Canada and the U.K. in recent months.At the time of the prisoner release, Secretary of State John Kerry and the White House portrayed it as a diplomatic breakthrough. Mr. Kerry cited the importance of  the relationships forged and the diplomatic channels unlocked over the course of the nuclear talks. For entire story: Wall Street JournalAs a bonus, here is Rep.

In a time of extreme political divide, students both Republican and Democrat at one Texas college have found something they can agree on.For the past two years at Southern Methodist University, a campus group has planted thousands of American flags in front of Dallas Hall as a memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. That s simply contradictory to the very definition of free speech,  said Grant Wolf, the Young Americans for Freedom Chairman.But in July, SMU changed its policy, saying student groups can no longer have displays there.The lawn has historically hosted tributes and protests from students of all political affiliations.

"Aug 20, 2015","Hillary Clinton is trying to blame the State Department for her lawlessness but new information is coming out showing the destruction of evidence by two Clinton aides. Thank goodness for Judicial Watch and their effort to get to the bottom of this e-mail scandal. Hillary Clinton and two aides appear to have violated two national security laws by sending classified information on a private email server, according to a former Army counterintelligence agent and investigator for a public interest law group.Additionally, the two Clinton aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, disregarded a federal judge s order this month requiring both to make sworn statements to the court that all government documents in their possession will be returned to federal officials, said Chris Farrell, director of investigations for Judicial Watch, the law group. What we have is a secretary of state, the only cabinet official in our history, who established her own private email server   in an effort to avoid the normal protocols for unclassified and classified communications. It s an end run,  he said.Farrell, in a briefing on the Clinton email affair at the Judicial Watch offices, said supporters of Clinton have sought to portray the use of the private email system to send classified information as a minor administrative matter. It is not,  he said.  It is a national security crime, and should be a national security crime investigation,  he said, noting that Clinton created the private email server a week before she took up her duties at Foggy Bottom, indicating that she planned to avoid using official email that must be stored under federal rules.Two laws apply to the mishandling of classified data on unsecure networks, Farrell said.The first is 18 USC Sec. 1924, which outlaws the unauthorized removal and storage of classified information. Penalties can include fines and imprisonment for up to one year.That statute was used to prosecute retired Army General David Petraeus, a former CIA director who provided classified documents to his mistress and biographer, Paula Broadwell. Petraeus was sentenced to two years  probation and a $40,000 fine as part of a plea deal in March.A second federal statute that prosecutors could use to charge Clinton and her aides is 18 USC Sec. 793, a more serious felony statute Farrell described as a  hammer. That law covers national defense information and people who misuse it to injure the United States or benefit a foreign power.Those convicted of violating that law face fines and up to 10 years in prison.Farrell said he that as an Army counterintelligence officer, he has conducted investigations in the past that are similar to the Clinton email probe. He also worked at a special security officer who was in charge of SCIFs special facilities used for handling sensitive intelligence. When it comes the law on these, intent doesn t matter,  Farrell said. Mishandling top-secret information should bring down the full weight of the law on violators, he said.The Clinton email matter is a  serious national security crime issue,  Farrell said.  It s not two agencies fighting over classification after the fact. Judicial Watch currently has 18 lawsuits pending against the State Department seeking access to records under the Freedom of Information Act. THE CLINTON E-MAIL SCANDAL EXPLAINED IN 2 1/2 MINUTES: A hearing on one of the lawsuits is set for Thursday before Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who recently ordered Clinton, Abedin, and Mills to make the sworn statements regarding federal documents in their possession.According to Farrell, only Clinton supplied the sworn statement that promised to return all government data and not destroy any records involved in the case. Abedin and Mills, however, did not and instead supplied the court with statements from their lawyers.Thursday s court hearing will be the latest turn in an unfolding security scandal involving the former secretary of state that has the potential to undermine her bid to win the Democratic presidential nomination.Via: WFB",BREAKING REPORT: CLINTON AND TWO AIDES BROKE NATIONAL SECURITY LAWS

During that dinner, Conason reports, Albright asked the former secretaries to impart advice to Clinton. Powell told her to use her own email, as he had done, except for classified communications, which he had sent and received via a State Department computer,  Conason wrote in his book  Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton,  of which the Times said it acquired an advance copy. Powell, according to Conason s account, told Clinton that  his use of personal email had been transformative for the department  and  thus confirmed a decision [Clinton] had made months earlier   to keep her personal account and use it for most messages. A spokeswoman for Powell s office issued a statement following the Times  story:  General Powell has no recollection of the dinner conversation. He did write former Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department. At the time there was no equivalent system within the Department. He used a secure State computer on his desk to manage classified information,  the statement continued.  The General no longer has the email he sent to former Secretary Clinton. It may exist in State or FBI files.

Jeremy Schneider writes Hey Mike, I have nothing but respect for you. Your no-nonsense outlook and incredible eloquence have really had a profound impact in my life. Can you please encourage your huge following to go out and vote this election? I would never impose on you by asking you to advocate one politician over another, but I do feel this election could really use your help. I know that there are many people out there who feel like there is nothing they can do. Please try to use your gifts to make them see that they can do something   that their vote counts. Hi Jeremy Thanks for the kind words. I appreciate it. I also share your concern for our country, and agree wholeheartedly that every vote counts. However, I m afraid I can t encourage millions of people whom I ve never met to just run out and cast a ballot, simply because they have the right to vote. That would be like encouraging everyone to buy an AR-15, simply because they have the right to bear arms. I would need to know a few things about them before offering that kind of encouragement. For instance, do they know how to care for a weapon? Can they afford the cost of the weapon? Do they have a history of violence? Are they mentally stable? In short, are they responsible citizens? I would need to know a few things about them before offering that kind of encouragement,  he told the reader.  For instance, do they know how to care for a weapon? Can they afford the cost of the weapon? Do they have a history of violence? Are they mentally stable? In short, are they responsible citizens? And responsibility is what it all comes down to. Casting a ballot is not so different. It s an important right that we all share, and one that impacts our society in dramatic fashion. But it s one thing to respect and acknowledge our collective rights, and quite another thing to affirmatively encourage people I ve never met to exercise them. And yet, my friends in Hollywood do that very thing, and they re at it again,  he observed.He said that liberal celebrities urge their fans to  get out and vote  during every presidential election cycle, calling it our  most important civic duty,  noting that  they speak as if the very act of casting a ballot is more important than the outcome of the election. Calling those pleas  somewhat hysterical,  Rowe said there s an ulterior motive behind them. Does anyone actually believe that Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen DeGeneres, and Ed Norton would encourage the  masses  to vote, if they believed the  masses  would elect Donald Trump?  he asked.He described voting as  a right, not a duty, and not a moral obligation,  which carries with it a responsibility on the part of the voter. But even the irresponsible are allowed to cast a ballot. If you believe aliens from another planet walk among us, you are welcome at the polls. If you believe the world is flat, and the moon landing was completely staged, you are invited to cast a ballot. Astrologists, racists, ghost-hunters, sexists, and people who rely upon a Magic 8 Ball to determine their daily wardrobe are all allowed to participate. In fact, and to your point, they re encouraged. Rowe reasoned that encouraging everyone to vote   regardless of their mental state or knowledge of issues and current events is crazy. When they tell us that  everybody in the country should get out there and vote,  regardless of what they think or believe, I gotta wonder what they re smoking.

America needs to stop being afraid to speak out and stand up to this culture of hate for cops being promoted by Obama, Holder, Soros and Sharpton Kevin Daigle, 54, was arrested Sunday in suspicion of shooting Louisiana State Police Trooper Steven Vincent in the head.A gunman who critically wounded a decorated Louisiana State Police trooper Sunday afternoon near Lake Charles was tackled by passing motorists, authorities said.Army veteran and 13-year veteran of the state agency Trooper Steven Vincent stopped to check on a suspected impaired driver stuck in a ditch along Highway 14 only to be shot in the head during the ensuing arrest, Sgt. James Anderson told the Daily News. It was pandemonium out here,  Anderson said.Several good Samaritans pulled over to help the 43-year-old trooper and used his radio to call authorities. The motorists then detained the suspect on their own with Vincent s handcuffs.The suspect was later identified as 54-year-old Kevin Daigle, of Lake Charles. We re so thankful for them,  Anderson added.  They arrived on scene and called for assistance for the trooper. The agency s top cop, Col. Michael Edmonson, first shared news of Vincent s injuries in a widely-shared Facebook post. Please take a moment from your Sunday afternoon to send prayers and well wishes to the Trooper and his family in this critical time,  Edmonson wrote.Vincent was airlifted to a local hospital where he is in critical, but stable condition.UPDATE: OFFICER VINCENT HAS DIEDAnderson said the Daigle appeared  belligerent. A photo later shared by authorities showed Daigle grimacing in a photograph.

"Aug 23, 2016","After Obama was embarrassed by Donald Trump acting more  presidential  than he, as Trump traveled to one of the poorest states in America bringing a semi-truck filled with needs for the LA flood victims. He finally managed to find his way off the golf course on Martha s Vineyard to visit the people who couldn t have cared less if he showed or not, by the time he got there. Like Trump said, it was  too little too late for Obama s phony photo-op.Of course, only Obama could turn the flood into a race issue. While refusing so far to survey the Louisiana flood disaster until days later, he did let state and local officials know that he s watching to make sure they don t engage in racial discrimination. In a 16-page guidance issued Tuesday, the Obama administration, led by the Justice Department, warned Louisiana recipients of federal disaster assistance against engaging in  unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin (including limited English proficiency). The guidance s frameworks  highlight the importance of complying with nondiscrimination requirements of civil rights statutes, addressing the needs of the whole community, and ensuring equal opportunity to access recovery efforts. Black residents should be asking where the thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters, who are so concerned about the lives of Blacks in America are when they really could ve used their help? George Soros, Al Sharpton and Barack are so good at organizing, why weren t they putting their heads together and coming up with a plan to help the poor black residents of LA who had lost everything they owned to the historic flooding? They can be organized in a very short time to create chaos, burn cities and loot, but where are they when they have an opportunity to do something positive for Blacks in LA? The recent flooding that hit Louisiana is the worst natural disaster to hit the United States since Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey in 2012. So far we know that at least 13 are dead and tens of thousands were left homeless in the flooding. Even worse, most of those affected do not have flood insurance. Up to $21 billion worth of housing stock was wiped out by the deluge of rain.The recovery will be long and difficult in one of the poorest states in the country. There is the challenge of finding employment and housing for all these displaced people. Given the fact that Louisiana is a hot and humid state most of the year, there will also be the issues of dealing with mold and increased injuries as people try to rebuild.But one of the greatest stories of the Louisiana flooding is how the people and free markets are playing a role in helping to both rescue people and deliver relief much quicker than the government.Black patriot Arlene Barnum asks,  Where s the BlackLivesMatter men? Citizens to the RescueThe rains that swamped parts of Louisiana over a period of a few days were relentless. Local governments and first responders were overwhelmed with calls for help from people trapped in their homes by rising waters.#CajunNavy pic.twitter.com/hjScnNu7Gy  Ben Sanders (@BenSandersLaw) August 14, 2016Instead of waiting for the government to come rescue them, the people of Louisiana used their own privately-owned boats to save their neighbors. This  Cajun Navy  drew its ranks and fleet from Louisiana s large numbers of sportsmen. People who needed rescue contacted a Facebook group and the boats used smartphone apps such as the GPS app Glympse and the walkie talkie app Zello to coordinate. The  Cajun Navy  was responsible for saving the lives of thousands of Louisianians and their pets and livestock.#CajunNavy is shown deploying in this pic by Troy @gulfsails #BatonRougeFlood pic.twitter.com/P9yI0QRQoM  walter michot (@WalterMichot) August 15, 2016#CajunNavy doing what they can to help in #BatonRouge pic.twitter.com/7nltb8Q1nU  Ashley Doan (@AshleyMDoan) August 15, 2016The people of Louisiana also distributed immediate relief to their displaced neighbors much more efficiently than the government was able to. One of the best examples of this was the conversion of a movie studio into a shelter housing over 2,000 people. The Celtic Media Centre is one of Louisiana s premier film production studios located in Baton Rouge, which was one of the cities hardest hit by the flooding. The studio s executive director, Patrick Mulhearn, saw how devastated his neighbors were by the high water and decided to open up Celtic as an emergency shelter.There were smaller examples of churches opening themselves up, without prodding by either the Red Cross or the state government, as storm shelters for those who lost everything. Such shelters are all over the parishes that were flooded, and have largely been stocked with supplies by volunteers all over the state. People are even taking donations to the parking lots of stores that were unaffected to bring food, water, and other supplies to the flood zone.People looking to donate supplies have been coordinating their relief efforts on Facebook and other social media. If people are looking to donate supplies, they can use social media to find places to drop them off. If people in other parts of the state and out of state want to donate, they re being directed on social media to places where they can help.Even while the streets of Louisiana flooded, trucks from Wal-Mart and UPS did not stop rolling. Wal-Mart, in particular, was able to use its corporate meteorologists to plan delivery routes and shift deliveries of much-needed supplies such as baby formula and water to the affected areas. UPS is able to prioritize delivery of items such as mail order prescription drugs. Companies are rushing supplies into the disaster area quicker than lethargic government agencies and the Red Cross.Motivated by HistoryIn 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, Louisianians tried waiting on the government. That help never came and over 1,500 Louisianians died in the flood waters of New Orleans, St. Bernard Parish, Plaquemines Parish, and Jefferson Parish. The people of Louisiana learned the hard way that they had to rescue themselves.The people of Louisiana were motivated by a sense of community. While the Federal government was giving anti-discrimination lectures to flood victims, the Cajun Navy was rescuing people of all races. Louisiana has come together like never before.But it wasn t just the compassion of the people of Louisiana that saved lives. Companies which were seeking profit were also responsible. Everyone from the smartphone app developers to the retailers who provided the products to sustain and save lives played a role in this. Businesses and entrepreneurs meeting the needs of customers were literally lifesavers.For entire story: Kevin Boyd","DON’T EXPECT GOVERNMENT Or Black Lives Matter To Help: PRIVATE CITIZENS, FREE MARKET Provide Much Needed Help For Total Strangers In LA Flood"

This is the day of terrorism where Islamists will do pretty much anything to hide explosives or a weapon so we now have to endure a very  intimate  examination in order to keep us all safe when flying. The new procedure was put in place a month ago-Please see the specifics below.Do you have a story to tell? We d like to hear it. Here s Jenna s story below:Jenna MacFarlane was on the way to visit a friend in Baltimore in April when her carry-on bag triggered an alarm at Charlotte s airport.A Transportation Security Administration screener told MacFarlane she would have to undergo a full-body pat-down by a female officer. Late for her flight and with no option other than to be searched in private, MacFarlane agreed.The pat-down, done over her clothes, explored her breasts, crotch and buttocks. I did not imagine that she would ask me a few times to spread my legs wider and in fact touch my vagina four times with the side of her hand,  MacFarlane later wrote in a complaint to the TSA.Just a month before her search, TSA had launched a new,  more involved  pat-down procedure:Pat-down procedures are used to determine whether prohibited items or other threats to transportation security are concealed on the person. You may be required to undergo a pat-down procedure if the screening technology alarms, as part of random or unpredictable security measures, for enhanced screening, or as an alternative to other types of screening, such as advanced imaging technology screening. Even passengers who normally receive expedited screening, such as TSA Pre  passengers, may at times receive a pat-down.A pat-down may include inspection of the head, neck, arms, torso, legs, and feet. This includes head coverings and sensitive areas such as breasts, groin, and the buttocks. You may be required to adjust clothing during the pat-down. The officer will advise you of the procedure to help you anticipate any actions before you feel them. Pat-downs require sufficient pressure to ensure detection, and areas may undergo a pat-down more than once for the TSA officer to confirm no threat items are detected.TSA officers use the back of the hands for pat-downs over sensitive areas of the body. In limited cases, additional screening involving a sensitive area pat-down with the front of the hand may be needed to determine that a threat does not exist.You will receive a pat-down by an officer of the same gender. TSA officers will explain the procedures to you as they conduct the pat-down. Please inform an officer if you have difficulty raising your arms or remaining in the position required; an external medical device; or areas of the body that are painful when touched. You may request a chair to sit if needed.At any time during the process, you may request private screening accompanied by a companion of your choice. A second officer of the same gender will always be present during private screening.Read more here: Charlotte Observer",AIRPORT PASSENGER “PAT DOWNS” Get More Intrusive With New Full-Body Groping Procedures

The problem is that Romney failed in his strategy of being Mr. Nice Guy and not attacking which really let Obama just steamroll over him in 2012. Not a good idea!Colorful former Trump adviser Roger Stone thinks 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney is thinking about getting back in the presidential race. Stone tweeted his suspicion, and told CNN he had heard that Romney was considering a run from his sources.The move could indicate Romney sees an opportunity to better confront and challenge front-runner Donald Trump. Some see current establishment standard bearer former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as flailing. Trump has mocked Bush for being  just flat  on the campaign trail and Sunday called him a  low energy  candidate.Romney publicly considered a third run as recently as January, but decided against it, after he lost most of his valuable donor base to Bush, and the massive prospective Republican field proved too unpredictable.Romney ran for president in 2012, and lost the nomination to Sen. John McCain in 2008. Romney supporters point to Ronald Reagan s three attempts at the White House   1968, 1976, before his successful win in 1980, as evidence that Romney has a chance.The man who floated this rumor, Trump s former adviser Stone, has a history almost as colorful as that of his former boss. Stone was an aide to President Richard Nixon, and remains one of Nixon s staunchest defenders. He is known for his penchant for expensive but elaborate dress clothes, which are often a departure from the more understated nature of most political menswear.He has been described as a  self-admitted hit man for the GOP  by the Daily Beast, is a popular presence on Twitter, and allegedly, has a tattoo of his former boss   Nixon  on his back.Via: Washington Examiner",IS ROMNEY SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT ENTERING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE?

What he s saying is, people should come to this country legally. And I know about that process very well because my husband is going through it right now and it s extremely expensive. So there s more incentive for people to come over to this country illegally. So all he s saying is, let s make the process to come here easier and less expensive so there s more incentive to do that. When people cross the border who are not supposed to be here, let s make sure they are sent back. But what the media is doing is twisting and turning everything that he s saying and what s so frustrating as an American is that the point is not getting across.

"Aug 25, 2017","Just days after the death of his own son in combat, Lt Gen John Kelly eulogized two other sons in an unforgettable manner:Two years ago when I was the Commander of all U.S. and Iraqi forces, in fact, the 22nd of April 2008, two Marine infantry battalions, 1/9  The Walking Dead,  and 2/8 were switching out in Ramadi. One battalion in the closing days of their deployment going home very soon, the other just starting its seven-month combat tour.Two Marines, Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan Haerter, 22 and 20 years old respectively, one from each battalion, were assuming the watch together at the entrance gate of an outpost that contained a makeshift barracks housing 50 Marines.The same broken down ramshackle building was also home to 100 Iraqi police, also my men and our allies in the fight against the terrorists in Ramadi, a city until recently the most dangerous city on earth and owned by Al Qaeda. Yale was a dirt poor mixed-race kid from Virginia with a wife and daughter, and a mother and sister who lived with him and he supported as well. He did this on a yearly salary of less than $23,000. Haerter, on the other hand, was a middle class white kid from Long Island.They were from two completely different worlds. Had they not joined the Marines they would never have met each other, or understood that multiple America s exist simultaneously depending on one s race, education level, economic status, and where you might have been born. But they were Marines, combat Marines, forged in the same crucible of Marine training, and because of this bond they were brothers as close, or closer, than if they were born of the same woman.The mission orders they received from the sergeant squad leader I am sure went something like:  Okay you two clowns, stand this post and let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass.   You clear?  I am also sure Yale and Haerter then rolled their eyes and said in unison something like:  Yes Sergeant,  with just enough attitude that made the point without saying the words,  No kidding sweetheart, we know what we re doing.  They then relieved two other Marines on watch and took up their post at the entry control point of Joint Security Station Nasser, in the Sophia section of Ramadi, al Anbar, Iraq.A few minutes later a large blue truck turned down the alley way perhaps 60-70 yards in length and sped its way through the serpentine of concrete jersey walls. The truck stopped just short of where the two were posted and detonated, killing them both catastrophically. Twenty-four brick masonry houses were damaged or destroyed. A mosque 100 yards away collapsed. The truck s engine came to rest two hundred yards away knocking most of a house down before it stopped.Our explosive experts reckoned the blast was made of 2,000 pounds of explosives. Two died, and because these two young infantrymen didn t have it in their DNA to run from danger, they saved 150 of their Iraqi and American brothers-in-arms.When I read the situation report about the incident a few hours after it happened I called the regimental commander for details as something about this struck me as different. Marines dying or being seriously wounded is commonplace in combat. We expect Marines regardless of rank or MOS to stand their ground and do their duty, and even die in the process, if that is what the mission takes. But this just seemed different.The regimental commander had just returned from the site and he agreed, but reported that there were no American witnesses to the event just Iraqi police. I figured if there was any chance of finding out what actually happened and then to decorate the two Marines to acknowledge their bravery, I d have to do it as a combat award that requires two eye-witnesses and we figured the bureaucrats back in Washington would never buy Iraqi statements. If it had any chance at all, it had to come under the signature of a general officer.I traveled to Ramadi the next day and spoke individually to a half-dozen Iraqi police all of whom told the same story. The blue truck turned down into the alley and immediately sped up as it made its way through the serpentine. They all said,  We knew immediately what was going on as soon as the two Marines began firing.  The Iraqi police then related that some of them also fired, and then to a man, ran for safety just prior to the explosion.All survived. Many were injured   some seriously. One of the Iraqis elaborated and with tears welling up said,  They d run like any normal man would to save his life. What he didn t know until then, he said, and what he learned that very instant, was that Marines are not normal. Choking past the emotion he said,  Sir, in the name of God no sane man would have stood there and done what they did. No sane man. They saved us all. What we didn t know at the time, and only learned a couple of days later after I wrote a summary and submitted both Yale and Haerter for posthumous Navy Crosses, was that one of our security cameras, damaged initially in the blast, recorded some of the suicide attack. It happened exactly as the Iraqis had described it. It took exactly six seconds from when the truck entered the alley until it detonated.You can watch the last six seconds of their young lives. Putting myself in their heads I supposed it took about a second for the two Marines to separately come to the same conclusion about what was going on once the truck came into their view at the far end of the alley. Exactly no time to talk it over, or call the sergeant to ask what they should do. Only enough time to take half an instant and think about what the sergeant told them to do only a few minutes before:     let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass. The two Marines had about five seconds left to live. It took maybe another two seconds for them to present their weapons, take aim, and open up. By this time the truck was half-way through the barriers and gaining speed the whole time. Here, the recording shows a number of Iraqi police, some of whom had fired their AKs, now scattering like the normal and rational men they were some running right past the Marines. They had three seconds left to live.For about two seconds more, the recording shows the Marines  weapons firing non-stop the truck s windshield exploding into shards of glass as their rounds take it apart and tore in to the body of the son-of-a-bitch who is trying to get past them to kill their brothers American and Iraqi bedded down in the barracks totally unaware of the fact that their lives at that moment depended entirely on two Marines standing their ground. If they had been aware, they would have know they were safe   because two Marines stood between them and a crazed suicide bomber.The recording shows the truck careening to a stop immediately in front of the two Marines. In all of the instantaneous violence Yale and Haerter never hesitated. By all reports and by the recording, they never stepped back. They never even started to step aside. They never even shifted their weight. With their feet spread shoulder width apart, they leaned into the danger, firing as fast as they could work their weapons. They had only one second left to live.The truck explodes. The camera goes blank. Two young men go to their God.Six seconds.Not enough time to think about their families, their country, their flag, or about their lives or their deaths, but more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty   into eternity.

Carter s preparing to take the experience, knowledge, and contacts his group built during the primary to campaign against Hillary Clinton and for Donald Trump and other Republicans in battleground states across the country.Bruce Carter and Black Men for Bernie are at war with the Democratic establishment, whom he says pander for votes but haven t delivered meaningful results to minority communities for decades. Carter became politically active to support Bernie Sanders, who taught him how the establishment s only real constituency was the donor class. When he paired that knowledge with what he knew about the decline in the black and minority neighborhoods he loves, he realized Democratic politicians and the media had been lying. Bernie inspired us to disrupt the status quo because it only works for the elites and not regular people who are struggling,  Carter told Breitbart News.  If black communities vote for Hillary Clinton and Democrats in November, nothing will change because Democrats will continue to believe they don t have to do anything to earn our votes. Carter became one of the most prominent and recognizable supporters of the Sanders campaign by traveling the country in a tour bus and fleet of vehicles wrapped with the Black Men for Bernie logo and a picture of Sanders being arrested during the civil rights movement. His online videos received millions of views and featured celebrities like Mark Ruffalo and ice cream makers Ben and Jerry.This guy knows what he s doing when it comes to rallying the troops to get behind his candidate. Watch Carter organizing supporters for Bernie before Hillary cheated him out of the chance to become the Democrat Party candidate:Carter told Breitbart News that his greatest awakening of how Democrats exploit minority voters came when he learned from the Washington Post that the Democratic Party spends less than 2 percent of its campaign resources with minority-owned companies, even though they get better than 90 percent of the black vote. It is a practice that Carter calls  political slavery. Now Black Men for Bernie are rebranding and again planning to tour the country with an emphasis on battleground states. Carter says he s going to organize black and minority communities to vote against Hillary Clinton and the Democratic establishment. Donald Trump is a business man and a real estate mogul who could provide knowledge and resources to transform urban communities through the development of minority-owned businesses,  Carter said.  With this tour, we re going to show Mr. Trump and Republicans that the black and minority communities are ready to work with anyone willing to work with us to build opportunities in businesses, employment, and housing. We don t want welfare, we need opportunity. Carter had a lot of ideas when asked about what Trump could do to help him win black votes away from the Democrats.  When Donald Trump tells black people, what do you have to lose by voting for me, he s getting close to a message that will work, but it s not quite there yet,  Carter explained: We re going to go back to these communities in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and across the country to lead people to the facts about the Clintons  and Democrats  failures with our struggling communities,  Carter said:For Carter and the Black Men for Bernie, they can t unlearn what they discovered about Hillary during the primary.  We know that Hillary Clinton is for Hillary Clinton and the rich donors of the Clinton Foundation,  Carter said.  We know that Bill and Hillary did major damage to our communities the last time they were in the White House. We know they will lie about their opponents by unfairly labeling them sexists and racists and radicals. Donald Trump isn t a typical politician and he isn t beholden to the same old political powers,  Carter continued.  We want to earn our seat at the table in his administration and I think he and the Republicans are smart enough to realize that when we deliver them a historic number of minority votes, they better do a better job than the Democrats have done or they re never going to get an opportunity like this again.

Is Kim Jong-un is preparing his special forces for suicide parachute missions across the border on 70-year-old Stalin era biplanes?Footage has emerged of North Korean paratroops jumping from the aged aircraft from very low levels in a show of force.The aircraft, which were designed in 1947, have an incredibly low radar profile   meaning they are difficult to track using conventional radar. They also fly at such a slow speed that modern anti-aircraft systems are programmed to ignore their limited returns.Also, the aircraft can hug the earth meaning ground-based missile systems will not pick them up and supersonic attack jets will find difficulty in detecting them from above. The bottom of the wings and the fuselage of Kim s fleet of aircraft have been painted blue with the top of the wings is green as a form of camouflage to prevent both ground troops and aircraft spotting them. According to The Drive, the aircraft could even land on short sections of road, allowing their troops to disembark and begin a sneak attack. It is feared the old aircraft could even deliver a nuclear bomb   possibly in a suicide attack into a strategically vital location. It is believed North Korea has at least 1,000 artillery pieces within striking range of Seoul, the South Korean capital, which is home to 25 million people. Kim has claimed North Korea now has technology to miniaturise its nuclear weapons to fit onto an ballistic missile. North Korea could potentially load a bomb onto the back of an An-2   with its one-tonne cargo capacity   and detonate it over the south.

To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.

You see, my son s body lay in a street after an IED blew up the vehicle he was fighting in. His blood stains the sands of Afghanistan. He died protecting the ideals of the flag you refuse to respect. He died so that ungrateful, privileged, arrogant men like you can be just that   ungrateful, privileged, and arrogant.There are brave men and women all around that stand between evil and you.

Horace Frank with the Los Angeles Police Department stated in a press conference in October 2016: The male caller threatened to kill the person who answered the phone along with other members of the center because of the caller s hatred for Muslims and his belief that Muslims will destroy the United States.

"Aug 3, 2015","Is there really any point to go through the work and expense to become an American citizen anymore?Huntington Park may become the first city in California to appoint two undocumented immigrants as commissioners on city advisory boards, a lawmaker confirms.City Councilman Jhonny Pineda has picked Francisco Medina to join the health and education commission and Julian Zatarain for the parks and recreation commission.The 32-year-old lawmaker told CBSLA online producer Deborah Meron that he promised voters while running for office that he would create more opportunities for undocumented residents. Huntington Park is a city of opportunity and a city of hope for all individuals regardless of socioeconomic status, race, creed, or in this case, citizenship,  the councilman said in a statement.  Both these gentlemen have accomplished a great deal for the city. For that, on behalf of the city council, mayor, and our city, I want to say thank you to them both and I am confident they will do an excellent job on their commission posts. Pineda says he cleared the appointments with the city attorney, who confirmed there s nothing that requires a commissioner to be a registered voter, a documented citizen or even a resident, which technically means someone here without legal residency can serve.Appointees first pass a LifeScan background check.Medina and Zatarain would not be paid for the volunteer positions and would not have a direct hand in constructing policy but would help advise the council on legislation. Other commissioners receive a $75 monthly stipend on months when they hold meetings.Coming the same year that California allowed residents to apply for a driver s license, regardless of immigration status, this move is the latest in an effort to recognize an increasingly sizable demographic in the state.Pineda says at 13 years old he emigrated alone to the United States. He established legal residency and told Meron he feels blessed to have been able to come here and work. He s served as a district representative on the California State Senate and legislative assistant for the U.S. House of Representatives. He currently is president of the California Latino Leadership Institute, an organization designed for young professionals interested in leadership development and serving their community.A graduate from Cal State Dominguez Hills with a bachelor s degree in sociology and Chicano studies, Medina interned for then-Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, who now serves on the Los Angeles City Council, Pineda says. Medina also organizes immigration forums aimed a helping working-class communities.Pineda says the decision will be announced at the City Council meeting scheduled for 6 p.m. Monday and will become official after being processed by the council.Via: CBS Los Angeles",TWO ILLEGAL ALIENS TO BECOME FIRST APPOINTED CITY COMMISSIONERS: Hope To Create More Opportunities For Illegals

"Aug 31, 2016","In January 2015 a group of Haitians surrounded the New York offices of the Clinton Foundation. They chanted slogans, accusing Bill and Hillary Clinton of having robbed them of  billions of dollars.  Two months later, the Haitians were at it again, accusing the Clintons of duplicity, malfeasance, and theft. And in May 2015, they were back, this time outside New York s Cipriani, where Bill Clinton received an award and collected a $500,000 check for his foundation.  Clinton, where s the money?  the Haitian signs read.  In whose pockets?  Said Dhoud Andre of the Commission Against Dictatorship,  We are telling the world of the crimes that Bill and Hillary Clinton are responsible for in Haiti. Haitians like Andre may sound a bit strident, but he and the protesters had good reason to be disgruntled. They had suffered a heavy blow from Mother Nature, and now it appeared that they were being battered again   this time by the Clintons. Their story goes back to 2010, when a massive 7.0 earthquake devastated the island, killing more than 200,000 people, leveling 100,000 homes, and leaving 1.5 million people destitute.The devastating effect of the earthquake on a very poor nation provoked worldwide concern and inspired an outpouring of aid money intended to rebuild Haiti. Countries around the world, as well as private and philanthropic groups such as the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, provided some $10.5 billion in aid, with $3.9 billion of it coming from the United States.Haitians such as Andre, however, noticed that very little of this aid money actually got to poor people in Haiti. Some projects championed by the Clintons, such as the building of industrial parks and posh hotels, cost a great deal of money and offered scarce benefits to the truly needy. Port-au-Prince was supposed to be rebuilt; it was never rebuilt. Projects aimed at creating jobs proved to be bitter disappointments. Haitian unemployment remained high, largely undented by the funds that were supposed to pour into the country. Famine and illness continued to devastate the island nation.The Haitians were initially sympathetic to the Clintons. One may say they believed in the message of  hope and change.  With his customary overstatement, Bill told the media,  Wouldn t it be great if they become the first wireless nation in the world? They could, I m telling you, they really could. I don t blame the Haitians for falling for it; Bill is one of the world s greatest story-tellers. He has fooled people far more sophisticated than the poor Haitians. Over time, however, the Haitians wised up. Whatever their initial expectations, many saw that much of the aid money seems never to have reached its destination; rather, it disappeared along the way.Where did it go? It did not escape the attention of the Haitians that Bill Clinton was the designated UN representative for aid to Haiti. Following the earthquake, Bill Clinton had with media fanfare established the Haiti Reconstruction Fund. Meanwhile, his wife Hillary was the United States secretary of state. She was in charge of U.S. aid allocated to Haiti. Together the Clintons were the two most powerful people who controlled the flow of funds to Haiti from around the world.Bill and Hillary weren t the only ones profiting off the devastation of poor Haitians. This video shows how Hillary s brother cashed in on a lucrative gold-mining permit in Haiti:An unusual nexus of mining interests, relief work in Haiti, and a former U.S. first family is raising new ethics questions that could affect Hillary Clinton s presidential ambitions.Clinton s brother, Tony Rodham, was a board member of a North Carolina mining company that enjoyed prime access to Haitian gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by former president Bill Clinton through the Clinton Foundation.Another board member of the firm, VCS Mining, was former Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, who co-chaired the charitable Interim Haiti Recovery Commission with Mr. Clinton.https://youtu.be/nlS4SimQfv8The Haitian protesters noticed an interesting pattern involving the Clintons and the designation of how aid funds were used. They observed that a number of companies that received contracts in Haiti happened to be entities that made large donations to the Clinton Foundation. The Haitian contracts appeared less tailored to the needs of Haiti than to the needs of the companies that were performing the services. In sum, Haitian deals appeared to be a quid pro quo for filling the coffers of the Clintons. For example, the Clinton Foundation selected Clayton Homes, a construction company owned by Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway, to build temporary shelters in Haiti. Buffett is an active member of the Clinton Global Initiative who has donated generously to the Clintons as well as the Clinton Foundation. The contract was supposed to be given through the normal United Nations bidding process, with the deal going to the lowest bidder who met the project s standards. UN officials said, however, that the contract was never competitively bid for.Clayton offered to build  hurricane-proof trailers  but what they actually delivered turned out to be a disaster. The trailers were structurally unsafe, with high levels of formaldehyde and insulation coming out of the walls. There were problems with mold and fumes. The stifling heat inside made Haitians sick and many of them abandoned the trailers because they were ill-constructed and unusable.The Clintons also funneled $10 million in federal loans to a firm called InnoVida, headed by Clinton donor Claudio Osorio. Osorio had loaded its board with Clinton cronies, including longtime Clinton ally General Wesley Clark; Hillary s 2008 finance director Jonathan Mantz; and Democratic fundraiser Chris Korge who has helped raise millions for the Clintons. Normally the loan approval process takes months or even years. But in this case, a government official wrote,  Former President Bill Clinton is personally in contact with the company to organize its logistical and support needs. And as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has made available State Department resources to assist with logistical arrangements.  InnoVida had not even provided an independently audited financial report that is normally a requirement for such applications. This requirement, however, was waived. On the basis of the Clinton connection, InnoVida s application was fast-tracked and approved in two weeks. The company, however, defaulted on the loan and never built any houses.An investigation revealed that Osorio had diverted company funds to pay for his Miami Beach mansion, his Maserati, and his Colorado ski chalet. He pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering in 2013, and is currently serving a twelve-year prison term on fraud charges related to the loan. Several Clinton cronies showed up with Bill to a 2011 Housing Expo that cost more than $2 million to stage. Bill Clinton said it would be a model for the construction of thousands of homes in Haiti. In reality, no homes have been built. A few dozen model units were constructed but even they have not been sold. Rather, they are now abandoned and have been taken over by squatters.THE SCHOOLS THEY NEVER BUILT USAID contracts to remove debris in Port-au-Prince went to a Washington-based company named CHF International. The company s CEO David Weiss, a campaign contributor to Hillary in 2008, was deputy U.S. trade representative for North American Affairs during the Clinton administration. The corporate secretary of the board, Lauri Fitz-Pegado, served in a number of posts in the Clinton administration, including assistant secretary of commerce.The Clintons claim to have built schools in Haiti. But the New York Times discovered that when it comes to the Clintons,  built  is a term with a very loose interpretation. For example, the newspaper located a school featured in the Clinton Founation annual report as  built through a Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action.  In reality,  The Clinton Foundation s sole direct contribution to the school was a grant for an Earth Day celebration and tree-building activity.

"Aug 4, 2017","Soooo the IRS lied to Americans to  prod  them to comply and sign up for Obamacare. They lied about the cost of Obamacare. Does anyone see the criminality in this? It s a classic bait and switch but by our government! The Obama administration  misled  Americans into thinking signing up for Obamacare would be cheaper than it really was, according to an inspector general s report Thursday that said the IRS dramatically understated the actual cost of enrolling. IRS officials sent the letters to try to prod Americans to comply with the 2010 health law s  individual mandate  that penalizes them for not holding coverage.But as part of the letters, the IRS said most people could find plans for $75 a month or less once government subsidies were figured in. That was untrue   in fact, the average cost was more than twice that figure, at $168 a month, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said. Many of the nearly 7.5 million taxpayers who receive letters and seek insurance may feel misled if the actual cost of their insurance is much higher than the $75 per month detailed in their notification letter,  the inspector general concluded. The IRS said it was only using numbers provided by Department of Health and Human Services and verified by the Treasury Department. They said the $75 figure was true for some taxpayers.The inspector general said it asked for that documentation but never received it.Auditors said their own analysis found the HHS studies were based on a smaller sample and was limited to those who chose lower-coverage plans with fewer benefits.According to the new audit, federal regulations require agencies to present accurate information.Investigators uncovered the misleading information as part of a broader audit about how the IRS was handling its role in alerting Americans who aren t complying with Obamacare s mandate to hold insurance.Read more: WT ",AUDIT: Obama’s IRS ‘Misled’ Americans to Get Them to Sign Up for Obamacare

The president s suggested,  Hey, you think it s too much trouble if we play golf again?  (snickers) And I have to look at him and say,  Yes!  RUSH: So Boehner can t play golf with Obama  cause of us. He can t play golf because he s afraid talk radio and Fox News are gonna wonder what he s up to and maybe   well, I don t know, reading his mind   think that we re gonna say he s selling out or that Obama s doing whatever.Some people were pushing me to run for the Senate. I decided I didn t want to do that, and I made a decision that the rest of my career was gonna be in the US House. So the team said to me,  All right, well, the rest of your career s gonna be in the House. What s your goal?  I didn t know! So I said,  Well, if you don t shoot for the top (snickers), why shoot for anything?  So I set my goal to be speaker.  ",PRICELESS!

"Aug 5, 2017","Adam Kredo of WFB asks the question we all want the answer to:  The fact that this information subsequently leaked to the press, I think raises even more questions about why a U.N ambassador over in Turtle Bay needs to unmask.  Samantha Power is a longtime Obama loyalist but her husband might be the key to all of this (see below).Power is believed to have made  hundreds  of unmasking requests to  identify individuals named in classified intelligence community reports related to Trump and his presidential transition team, according to multiple sources who said the behavior is unprecedented for an official in her position,  according to the Washington Free Beacon.Hannity asked Kredo how Power would ever have the authority to make the unmasking requests, and then asked whether this has ever happened previously to his knowledge. No, it s truly unprecedented,  Kredo said.  It s certainly odd, and I think the House Intelligence Committee, rightfully so, has subpoenaed her to find out what is going on here. Look, it s hundreds of unmasking requests in just the final year of the Obama administration. WE VE FOLLOWED THE  QUEEN OF GEORGE SOROS  AND HERE S WHAT WE KNOW:In 2005 06, Power worked as a foreign policy fellow in the office of U.S. Senator Barack Obama.In a 2007 interview, Power said that America s relationship with Israel  has often led foreign policy decision-makers to defer reflexively to Israeli security assessments, and to replicate Israeli tactics  The United States, she explained, had brought terrorist attacks upon itself by aping Israel s violations of human rights.Power has had her fair share of controversy, specifically after she was forced to resign from the president s 2008 campaign following negative remarks she made about Hillary Clinton.In an interview with The Scotsman during the heat of the 2008 presidential race, Power called Clinton a  monster. Power was soon back in with the Obama camp. Her husband is Obama s former Regulatory Czar Cass Sunstein.SUNSTEIN IS ONE SCARY GUY WHO WANTED GOVERNMENT TO INTRUDE ON YOUR PRIVACY:SALON reported:Cass Sunstein has long been one of Barack Obama s closest confidants. Often mentioned as a likely Obama nominee to the Supreme Court, Sunstein is Obama s head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs where, among other things, he is responsible for  overseeing policies relating to privacy, information quality, and statistical programs.  In 2008, while at Harvard Law School, Sunstein co-wrote a truly pernicious paper proposing that the U.S. Government employ teams of covert agents and pseudo- independent  advocates to  cognitively infiltrate  online groups and websites   as well as other activist groups   which advocate views that Sunstein deems  false conspiracy theories  about the Government. This would be designed to increase citizens  faith in government officials and undermine the credibility of conspiracists. The paper s abstract can be read, and the full paper downloaded, here.Sunstein advocates that the Government s stealth infiltration should be accomplished by sending covert agents into  chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups.  He also proposes that the Government make secret payments to so-called  independent  credible voices to bolster the Government s messaging (on the ground that those who don t believe government sources will be more inclined to listen to those who appear independent while secretly acting on behalf of the Government). This program would target those advocating false  conspiracy theories,  which they define to mean:  an attempt to explain an event or practice by reference to the machinations of powerful people, who have also managed to conceal their role.

"Aug 6, 2016","When you re Donald Trump (or any Republican for that matter) and the Washington Post comes to your defense, you know it means there are too many untruths surrounding the story to pull off this particular lie Donald Trump is complaining that the media has spun a fable that he kicked a baby out of his rally in Ashburn, Va.The New York Post, for instance, headlined its article:  Trump loves crying baby, then kicks the tot out of his rally. The New York Daily News, in its article on the incident, began:  What a baby. Donald Trump booted a fussy baby from a rally Tuesday because the tot was wailing over the businessman s speech. The Guardian newspaper even used the incident to declare that this is a core problem with Trump   that he has  a total lack of empathy. In reality, this is a situation when the video can lie   and Trump s odd sense of humor can backfire. Let s roll the tape.The FactsThere are two parts to the video. During his speech a baby starts to cry, and Trump says:  Don t worry about that baby, I love babies.   I hear that baby crying. I like it. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don t worry, don t worry. The mom s running around like   don t worry about it, you know. It s young and beautiful and healthy, and that s what we want. But then about a minute later he says:  Actually, I was only kidding. You can get the baby out of here.   I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I m speaking. So, just from watching the video, Trump sounds rather cruel. But what s missing is what the mother was doing. As it happens, Daniel Dale, a reporter from the Toronto Star, was sitting right behind her and wrote that the entire incident was mischaracterized.The baby was one row in front of me, three or four rows from the stage, at Trump s event at a high school in Ashburn, Va. When it began to cry, Trump said,  Don t worry about that baby, I love babies. I love babies. I hear that baby crying, I like it. I like it. What a baby, what a beautiful baby. Don t worry, don t worry. The mom s running around   don t worry about it. People applauded. One minute later, though, the baby began to cry again. This time, the mother quickly decided to take the baby out of the room. Trump, looking in our direction, appeared to notice that she was on her way to the exit.And then he said,  Actually, I was only kidding. You can get the baby out of here. That s all right. Don t worry. I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I m speaking?  He cupped his hand over his eyes to watch her leave.  That s okay, people don t understand. That s okay. A joke? Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trump s tone is eternally hard to read. But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection   it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mother s own decision to depart.One other salient fact is missing from all the pieces on babygate. Mom and baby, very much not kicked out, came back to their seat a bit later.The baby was sucking a pacifier, silent.Dale had this perspective because he was not sitting in the news media corral.  I almost never request press credentials from the Trump campaign anymore   partly because I like being in the crowd rather than the pen,  he told The Fact Checker.  I was lucky, this time, that the usher people seated me very close to the stage, and one row behind the baby. There was one empty seat up there. Virtually no one in the media noticed Dale s version of events. He said he did not seek to interview the mother himself, as he did not realize until later how much attention had been paid to this incident.  Washington PostWithin days, the Clinton campaign highlighted the baby affair in a video trashing Trump s week:Trump just said he  doesn t throw babies out  of his rallies Let s review the record.https://t.co/u3a8RDNNrr  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 5, 2016Trump responded (as only Trump can) to this ridiculous allegation while speaking at a rally in WI last night:The mother of the baby who Trump allegedly  ejected  from his rally, Devan Cierra Ebert is speaking out and setting the record straight about what REALLY happened.Statement from Devan Cierra Ebert who  was removed  with her crying baby at a Trump Rally: I was the mother in his rally on Tuesday, August 2nd, in Ashburn, VA, with the baby who started to cry. I would just like him to know personally that I, by no means felt I was ever  kicked out  of his rally.I excused myself and my child when he awoke from his nap and began to cry. It was only because I had to grab my child s belongings and then make my way out of the aisle I was seated in that I wasn t out of there sooner.I realize Mr. Trump doesn t know me personally, but for those that do, know that I am the first one to excuse myself and my child when he begins to cry because I personally believe it s rude to disturb anyone else s ability to hear what they came to see. I ve left movies, violin recitals, and other events if I felt my child was disturbing others. It is the considerate thing to do. I stood right outside the doors of the auditorium continuing to watch and listen to what Mr. Trump had to say. In fact, the police that were right outside in the same hallway with me, treated me with so much respect it was incredible. They were so kind and made me feel welcomed to stand with them.One officer commended me on my bravery to bring my child to Mr. Trump s rally.I fully support Mr. Trump. I thought he responded very graciously to my child crying and he made a lighthearted moment out of what I usually consider to be stressful. I actually was out of the auditorium before he even made his follow up comment about my child and even then, when I was informed of his comment,I laughed. I understand he says things jokingly, and I understand no one wants to speak over or struggle to listen over a crying baby.I am in no way offended and I again reiterate, Mr. Trump NEVER kicked me or my child out of the Briar Woods High School, Trump rally.And for the record, while my child and I stood outside of the auditorium, my eleven year old stepdaughter and my Grandmother sat inside the auditorium and continued to support and listen to everything Mr. Trump had to say.We all were so excited to be able to see Mr. Trump so close to home. I didn t have a babysitter to watch my kids and honestly, to me it was a historical moment that I am happy that my kids were there for.I apologize for the trouble this has caused Mr.Trump. The media has severely blown this out of proportion and made it out to be something that it wasn t and is clearly using this as political gain for the Democratic party.I hope this message sheds light to what really happened.Thank you for your time. Best of luck! You have our vote. Trump 2016 Via: Facebook",MOTHER OF CRYING BABY AT TRUMP RALLY: “Mr. Trump NEVER kicked me or my child out”…Liberal Reporter Backs Up Her Story
"Aug 7, 2015","Hello America Are we awake yet?AUSTIN, Texas   Texas Sheriffs, the Lieutenant Governor, and experts in immigration related issues met at the State Capitol on Wednesday to discuss the federal government s creation of a sanctuary state for criminal aliens through its Priority Enforcement Program (PEP).Jackson County Sheriff Aj (Andy) Louderback, immediate past president of the Sheriff s Association of Texas, told Breitbart Texas that the federal government s PEP program  has created a sanctuary state for criminal aliens because it has gutted the immigration system. A press conference was held on the crisis facing Texas that was created by the new immigration policies of the federal government. The sheriffs complained that aliens are being brought into the criminal justice system in Texas but are being released into the community because of the federal policies.In the past, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) could place a 48-hour hold on illegal immigrants when they were wanted on immigration related issues. The PEP program replaced the U.S. Department of Homeland Security s (DHS) Secure Communities plan and now that is no longer possible.The policy was released by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in November, 2014. In January, the program went into effect and Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby exclusively reported leaked training documents detailing how the program would be implemented. Darby dubbed the program,  Catch and Release 2.0. Breitbart Texas has reported many examples of criminal illegal aliens who have been previously deported many times only to come back and commit even more serious crimes.In July, Breitbart California s Michelle Moons reported on the murder of Katheryn Steinle. She was killed by an illegal alien who was released by the San Francisco sheriff despite an ICE detainer in effect. Her killer had been deported several times.The same week as Steinle s murder, Darby reported on the murder in Laredo, Texas, of a woman who was killed by her criminal illegal alien husband. He had been deported four times. Despite numerous domestic violence calls to the Laredo Police Department, he was allowed to remain in Laredo until he finally killed her.There have been many other such reports in the past month about violent criminal illegal aliens who commit more heinous crimes after returning from being deported.The lieutenant governor, Texas sheriffs, and the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies spoke at the press conference in Austin, Texas. Their message   the federal government has placed the public in danger through its policies, and these policies have essentially tied the hands of Texas law enforcement.Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (speaking) joined Sheriff Aj Louderback; Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne; Victoria County Sheriff Michael O Conner, and Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies for the Center for Immigration Studies. (Photo: Breitbart Texas/Lana Shadwick)Sheriff Louderback told Breitbart Texas,  This federal program (PEP) replaced a Congress-mandated program and replaced it with a program that now prioritizes criminal behavior and is excluding thousands of criminal aliens.  He says the program is forcing Texas sheriffs to sometimes release even violent offenders.Louderback said that criminal aliens know that law enforcement officials in Texas have their hands tied because of these new federal policies. They know they can come into the country illegally and stay here with impunity.He said illegal aliens cannot be held until after there is a final conviction. He said,  These criminals bond out and disappear into the country. These policies, say the immediate past sheriff s association president,  mean that local jurisdictions have to deal with the costs. Victoria County Sheriff Michael O Connor said criminal aliens are traversing over the border and coming in throughout the country. He said that the sheriffs intend to  connect, communicate, and collaborate with community stakeholders  to deal with the problem.Victoria County, Texas, is located about halfway between Houston and the Mexico/Texas border. He said his county is a  fatal tunnel between Harris County and the rest of the U.S. Sheriff Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas,  This is about a secure community program.  He said in 2008, law enforcement were able to do that. He said,  PEP is, and will be, a failure by this [federal] administration. Lt. Gov. Patrick promised that the senate would pass legislation to deal with the problems of sanctuary cities in the next legislative session. He said that he was confident that the senate now has the votes to deal with this issue. Sanctuary cities legislation was a contentious topic in the senate this past session.Via: Breitbart News","SHERIFFS, LT.

Specter s amendment would have stricken the provision regarding habeas review. The underlying bill would have authorized a trial by military commission for violations of the law of war. Here is what Senator Lindsey Graham had to say about the bill from the Senate floor:Senator Graham asked,  Do we really want enemy prisoners to bring every lawsuit known to man against the people fighting the war and protecting us? No enemy prisoner should have access to Federal courts a noncitizen, enemy combatant terrorist to bring a lawsuit against those fighting on our behalf. No judge should have the ability to make a decision that has been historically reserved to the military. That does not make us safer.

We do not have either rebellion or invasion, so it is a little hard for me to see, as a basic principle of constitutional law, how the Congress can suspend the writ of habeas corpus.

It s very dysfunctional.This guy just said whatever American would like to say to Paul Ryan! Notice how the answer was just more rhetoric blah, blah, blah All talk and NO ACTION!Paul Ryan is in the back pocket of the Chamber of Commerce and other special interest groups. He s talking out of both sides of his mouth. He needs to go!PAUL RYAN AUDIO GIVES US INSIGHT INTO HOW HE REALLY FEELS ABOUT TRUMP:AUDIO RELEASED: Paul Ryan Caught On Tape:  I am not going to defend Donald Trump not now, not in the future We all know Paul Ryan was no fan of President Donald Trump while he was running for office. Sadly, unlike the Democrats who held their noses and went  all in  for Hillary, our Republican Speaker of the House went out of his way to NOT support Trump during his highly contentious campaign. Now that a new audio tape has emerged, proving that Ryan went out of his way to make sure his colleagues in the House understood that he would  never  support Trump, this leaves Ryan looking pretty foolish considering the public support Trump has offered Ryan and his increasingly unpopular  Obamacare Lite  proposal.On a never-before-released private October conference call with House Republican members, House Speaker Paul Ryan told his members in the U.S. House of Representatives he was abandoning then-GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump forever and would never defend him ever again. In the Oct. 10, 2016 call, from right after the Access Hollywood tape of Trump was leaked in the weeks leading up to the election, Ryan does not specify that he will never defend Trump on just the Access Hollywood tape he says clearly he is done with Trump altogether. I am not going to defend Donald Trump not now, not in the future,  Ryan says in the audio, obtained by Breitbart News and published here for the first time ever.Now, Ryan still the Speaker has pushed now President Donald Trump to believe his healthcare legislation the American Health Care Act would repeal and replace Obamacare when it does not repeal Obamacare. Ryan has also, according to Trump ally Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), misled President Trump into believing that Ryan s bill can pass Congress. Paul and others believe the bill is dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate since a number of GOP senators have come out against it, and there are serious questions about whether it can pass the House. This is the first major initiative that Trump has worked on with Ryan and the fact it is going so poorly calls into question whether Speaker Ryan, the GOP s failed 2012 vice presidential nominee who barely supported Trump at all in 2016, really understands how Trump won and how to win in general.The October conference call apparently was intended only for House Republican members. It s unclear which or how many House Republicans took part in the call, whether the participants knew it was being recorded, who made the recording, or whether a recording exists of the entire call. The remarks on the portion provided to Breitbart News certainly sound like they were coming from Speaker Ryan, who seemed to be abandoning his party s presidential nominee altogether just weeks before the election. He says not only will he not defend the Access Hollywood comments, but he will not campaign with Trump at all between this call on Oct. 10, 2016, and the general election for the presidency on Nov. 8 and that Ryan would not defend Trump on anything generally.

"Aug 8, 2015","Every GOP Presidential candidate is racing to align themselves with Reagan. Is it possible they just don t really understand why America loved Reagan? Maybe it s just as simple as the fact that he genuinely loved America and was passionate about fixing what had been broken by the previous feckless administration. There are a few candidates in the GOP field who we believe truly love their country and have the same convictions and objectives as Trump. The question is, do any of them have the backbone to do what s needed to fix it? (By the way, we believe there are finally a few candidates in the GOP field besides Trump who do.) (Reuters photo credit)Beneath all the bluster of Trump, there is a very sincere idea that may explain why so many primary voters are flocking to him. And to understand it, we need to look back a few years to his amazing speech at CPAC in 2011:If I remember correctly, the typical conservative pitch one year before Obama s successful reelection campaign was: Obamacare is terrible, the economy is terrible, etc. Conservative principles will fix that. I enthusiastically retweeted a lot of that white noise.With Trump, however, he spent exactly one sentence on ObamaCare, and his economic critique instead fixated on the idea of our wounded national pride:The reason I m thinking about [running for office] is that the United States has become a whipping post for the rest of the world. The world is treating us without respect  America today is missing quality leadership, and foreign countries have quickly realized this. It s for this reason that The United States is becoming the laughingstock of the world  I deal with people from China, I deal with people from Mexico. They cannot believe what they re getting away with. I ve said on numerous occasions that countries like China, like India, South Korea, Mexico, and the OPEC nations view our leaders as weak and ineffective and have repeatedly taken advantage of them to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars a year.He focused his ire mostly on China for manipulating currency and OPEC for gouging prices at every opportunity (he did incorrectly predict $7-9 per gallon gasoline maybe he wasn t in the know on the fracking boom yet). The argument boiled down to two appeals: 1) Foreign countries are making out better than us, and 2) We look weak.In his signoff, Trump delivered a prototype of his current slogan:  if I run and if I win, this country will be respected again  Our country will be great again. That vow didn t come from some overblown promise to get possessed by Ronald Reagan s ghost. Trump simply stated he s had a lot of success in negotiations and business deals because he cares about and relentlessly fights to get the best outcome for his interests. Therefore, he would take that same relentless fight to get the best outcome for America s interests. That might mean screwing over China, Saudi Arabia, or Mexico home to plenty more poor citizens than ours but their leaders care nothing about poverty, and it s a screw-or-be-screwed world.Re-watching that speech, his message and pet issue haven t changed much in four years and I doubt many of us could honestly claim the same feat.As he s officially thrown his hat (and what a hat) into the ring, the Donald has expanded on that message. Not only is his approach the best to fix America s problems, he s saying, but none of his rivals can do it not because they re not competent enough (though, in time, he ll surely call them all dummy losers) but because they re not rich enough.In Thursday night s debate, Trump hammered on a theme of his budding campaign: big-money donations have strings attached take it from a guy who pulled them. I ll tell you what, with Hillary Clinton, I said,  Be at my wedding,  and she came to my wedding,  he said.  You know why? She had no choice because I gave. And, of course, very few big donors pull strings for favors as benign as a wedding RSVP (see: Peter Schweizer s Clinton Cash). The big business types with enough disposable income to donate so much cash to politicians, like Trump himself, have operations around the world and they re not quite as concerned with America s pride as DJT.Indeed, as the Chamber of Commerce crowd has proven with support of a wage-depressing immigration law, they re concerned with growth above all else. And the fastest path to their businesses  growth does not include the step of  More Money for America s Workers.  There s a reason we don t allow foreign nationals to donate to U.S. political campaigns. Trump is sounding the alarm on U.S. citizens whose interests and income can be effectively the same.This issue has been made all the more salient from two major stories coinciding with the start of the Republican primary: Obamatrade and the Iran nuclear deal. Part of a President s job, in a world more connected than ever, is negotiation with other world powers on economic and defense agreements. Over the past 7 years and beyond (most notably, the push for immigration paydirt during Bush 43 s tenure), globalists fueled by left-wing ideology or corporate cronyism have been representing America, while nationalists have been representing our greatest rivals.Obama s failures in defense are seemingly endless Trump s reminder of the Bergdahl prisoner swap seems like an eternity ago, followed by so much more but warnings on donor influence resonate most deeply after the GOP s handling of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for the White House.Indeed, even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) darling of the purest conservatives, inexplicably stood with the Republican establishment on TPA a massive globalist power grab until a last-minute blink, likely thanks to intense grassroots anger at his support. Over a month before Cruz s change of heart, Trump was riffing on a familiar theme:The trade deal is a disaster for many reasons. Number one, we don t have any good negotiators in our government. That s possibly the single greatest reason we don t have our best and our brightest negotiating for us. That s a real problem  What happens is all of these countries get the best of everything and we get the worst of everything.And one day before Cruz announced his opposition, Trump took to Twitter, saying,  Any Senator who votes for it is disqualified for being POTUS.  And he didn t forget his primary objection to the deal:  Protect the American worker and manufacturer! Through all of Trump s controversial life, I see plenty of reasons why reasonable people would balk at his run. I can see why conservatives want detailed policies from him and pledges of allegiance. But I don t see any reason to doubt his love for America.When he s talking about making America great again, I know he s not thinking some WASPy suburban paradise. He s thinking about Manhattan in the 1970s, where he first made a name for himself. He s talking about Weird America where  flash and excess  rule, where you can run for president after getting a WWE bio page.I like that America, where people file $500 million lawsuits over beauty pageants  Spanish-language broadcasts. I d like an America that makes 7  Fast & Furious  movies without making concessions to Ayatollah Khamenei. I d like an America that humiliates the likes of Vladimir Putin, not vice-versa. An America that punches back eight times as hard over a tiny offense. An America that everyone might laugh at but ultimately stop attacking because it can only end poorly for them.And if I trust that Trump likes America almost as much as he likes Donald Trump, then I trust that he will defend America s pride almost as much as does Donald Trump s. The rest of the GOP/Democrat field up to their necks in donors they ll need to mount a national campaign? Not so much.Via: Ezra Dulis  Breitbart News",THE SECRET BEHIND AMERICA’S LOVE AFFAIR WITH TRUMP [Video]

"Aug 8, 2017","There is no debating the fact that tensions between the United States and North Korea have reached a boiling point. But what s still being continuously debated is how to handle these tensions.President Trump threatened to use  fire and fury  against North Korea after it was revealed that North Korea successfully created a miniaturized nuclear weapon designed to fit inside its missiles. In an interview with NBC s Tim Russert in 1999, then businessman Donald Trump voiced his support for a pre-emptive military strike against North Korea.Trump told Russert that if he was President, a Trump administration would  negotiate like crazy  to  get the best deal possible.  If a deal was not possible, Trump said he would order a pre-emptive strike. He went on to successfully predict that that they re [North Korea] are going to have those weapons pointed all over the world and specifically at the United States.  He goes further by saying that it only does the U.S. minimal good to discuss the economy and Social Security without addressing the biggest problem: nuclear proliferation. He also calls out previous politicians   including Jimmy Carter   for not facing this situation head on and negotiating properly.Following President Trump s warning North Korea over further provocations, the Hermit Kingdom has announced it is considering striking Guam. The North Korean military warned it may carry out a preemptive operation once the US shows signs of provocation , and that it is seriously considering a strategy to strike Guam with mid-to-long range missiles. As Trump moves forward, this interview serves as evidence that his strategy will hold up against North Korea.Read more: The Gateway Pundit",FLASHBACK: TRUMP PLANS STRATEGY Against North Korea In ’99 Interview [Video]
"Aug 9, 2015","The race card thing is getting old fast The Austin County Sheriff s Office released the dash camera video of a July 14 traffic stop of State Representative Garnet Coleman Tuesday to refute claims Coleman made last week about being disrespected and treated  like a child. Coleman, as the chair of the Committee on County Affairs, held a hearing last Thursday in Austin as the first public inquiry into the arrest and death of Sandra Bland in Waller County. In that hearing, Coleman recounted his own history of being pulled over in traffic stops and gave this account of an I-10 traffic stop that happened just two weeks ago. He talked to me like I was a child,  he said of the sheriff s deputy who pulled him over for speeding.  He was so rude and nasty. Even when he found out I was a legislator, he became more rude and nasty. And I didn t understand why this guy was continuing to go on and on and treat me like a child. And basically like I m saying is treat me like a boy. I want to be very clear about that,  Coleman said in the committee hearing.  Via: Breaking 911KHOU    The Texas Municipal Police Association, the Harris County Deputies Organization, the Houston Police Officers  Union and the Dallas Police Union all issued demands for Coleman to apologize for his  fabrication  of the events in the traffic stop. Sheriff Brandes asked Coleman to apologize for his remarks about the sheriff s deputy. Instead, Coleman seemed to double down on the race card  boy  word. They may not have [thought it was rude],  Coleman told KHOU.  But they weren t sitting in my seat.

"Aug 9, 2017","It s one thing to have the media constantly painting police officers in a bad light on a near daily basis. But it s entirely another thing to have civilians discriminating against them on completely illegitimate grounds. This is exactly what happened this week when Jim Chambers, owner of the EAV Barbell Club in Atlanta, posted a sign on the front of his gym forbidding police officers.The message that the sign conveys alone is upsetting. But the expletives included make it an even more shocking and vulgar. While the sign is no longer posted on his gym s door, Chambers continue to stand by it. We ve had an explicitly stated  No Cop  policy since we opened, and we also don t open membership to active members of the military,  he said.As a lifelong political activist, Chamber says that his sign and policy serves as a political statement. He says groups who work out there are generally minorities who are uncomfortable with the presence of law enforcement agents. Chambers claimed that if any police officials had a warrant, they could do their job but that he is  not breaking the law. Chambers insists that they never have, and won t ever need the help of officers. He plans to put the  No Cop  sign back up without the foul language.When asked to comment, lawyers found the policy strange, but said because law enforcement officers are not a protected class under the law, only the courts can decide if EAV Barbell Club is violating any anti-discrimination laws. When asked to comment on the incident, the Atlanta Police Department stated,  Were we to respond to an emergency there, this sign would not stop us from lawfully doing our job.

"Dec 10, 2015","Another Gitmo detainee returns to terror Is anyone else starting to see a pattern here? Former Guantanamo detainee, Ibrahim Qosi, who is also known as Sheikh Khubayb al Sudani, is now an al-Qaeda leader in Yemen.April , 2012  For al-Qosi, his release will allow him to be reunited with his family. Unlike many other prisoners, all of his immediate family are still alive. As Paul Reichler, his Washington-based civilian attorney, who represented him pro bono for seven years, explained,  He is now in his 50s, eager only to spend his life at home with his family in Sudan   his mother and father, his wife and two teenage daughters, and his brothers and their families   and live among them in peace, quiet and freedom. His Pentagon-appointed defense lawyer, Navy Cmdr. Suzanne Lachelier, noted that, last week, al-Qosi was moved to  special quarters,  with  a flat-screen TV, a refrigerator that let him eat at his leisure and a small outdoor gravel-topped patio, all inside a locked enclosure.  Cmdr. Lachelier added there was also  a real bed rather than a steel bunk topped with a mat,  but that al-Qosi slept on the floor before leaving  because he suffers from a bad back. A source with knowledge of al-Qosi s case, who does not wish to be identified, told me that the Obama administration was unwilling to detain al-Qosi after his sentence came to an end, and I believe that one of the reasons that the President negotiated a waiver to the provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act, allowing him to bypass restrictions on releasing prisoners that were imposed by Congress, was to prevent Republicans from trying to force him to continueholding al-Qosi.Summing up his client, al-Qosi s lawyer, Paul Reichler said,  He is an intelligent, pious, humble and sincere individual who has endured much hardship the past 10 years. But he returns home without hatred or rancor. Really? Al-Qaeda leader = peace? The Long War Journal reported:Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) released a new video featuring a former Guantanamo detainee, Ibrahim Qosi, who is also known as Sheikh Khubayb al Sudani.In July 2010, Qosi plead guilty to charges of conspiracy and material support for terrorism before a military commission. His plea was part of a deal in which he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors during his remaining time in US custody. Qosi was transferred to his home country of Sudan two years later, in July 2012.Qosi joined AQAP in 2014 and became one of its leaders. Qosi and other AQAP commanders discussed their time waging jihad at length in the video, entitled  Guardians of Sharia. Islamic scholars ensure the  correctness  of the  jihadist project,  according to Qosi. And the war against America continues through  individual jihad,  which al Qaeda encourages from abroad. Here, Qosi referred to al Qaeda s policy of encouraging attacks by individual adherents and smaller terror cells. Indeed, AQAP s video celebrates jihadists who have acted in accordance with this call, such as the Kouachi brothers, who struck Charlie Hebdo s offices in Paris earlier this year. The Kouachi brothers  operation was sponsored by AQAP. Via: Gateway Pundit ",GITMO PRISONER OBAMA RELEASED IN 2012 Identified As Al-Qaeda Leader In Yemen

"Dec 11, 2016","Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has clearly stated his leaks did not come from Russia. Watch:Former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray, who is a close associate of Julian Assange, said he has met the DNC leaker and he s not Russian. h/t GPI have watched incredulous as the CIA s blatant lie has grown and grown as a media story   blatant because the CIA has made no attempt whatsoever to substantiate it. There is no Russian involvement in the leaks of emails showing Clinton s corruption. Yes this rubbish has been the lead today in the Washington Post in the US and the Guardian here, and was the lead item on the BBC main news. I suspect it is leading the American broadcasts also.A little simple logic demolishes the CIA s claims. The CIA claim they  know the individuals  involved. Yet under Obama the USA has been absolutely ruthless in its persecution of whistleblowers, and its pursuit of foreign hackers through extradition. We are supposed to believe that in the most vital instance imaginable, an attempt by a foreign power to destabilize a US election, even though the CIA knows who the individuals are, nobody is going to be arrested or extradited, or (if in Russia) made subject to yet more banking and other restrictions against Russian individuals? Plainly it stinks. The anonymous source claims of  We know who it was, it was the Russians  are beneath contempt.As Julian Assange has made crystal clear, the leaks did not come from the Russians. As I have explained countless times, they are not hacks, they are insider leaks   there is a major difference between the two. And it should be said again and again, that if Hillary Clinton had not connived with the DNC to fix the primary schedule to disadvantage Bernie, if she had not received advance notice of live debate questions to use against Bernie, if she had not accepted massive donations to the Clinton foundation and family members in return for foreign policy influence, if she had not failed to distance herself from some very weird and troubling people, then none of this would have happened.It is terrible that the prime conduit for this paranoid nonsense is a once great newspaper, the Washington Post, which far from investigating executive power, now is a sounding board for totally evidence free anonymous source briefing of utter bullshit from the executive.In the UK, one single article sums up the total abnegation of all journalistic standards. The truly execrable Jonathan Freedland of the Guardian writes  Few credible sources doubt that Russia was behind the hacking of internal Democratic party emails, whose release by Julian Assange was timed to cause maximum pain to Hillary Clinton and pleasure for Trump.  Does he produce any evidence at all for this assertion? No, none whatsoever. What does a journalist mean by a  credible source ? Well, any journalist worth their salt in considering the credibility of a source will first consider access. Do they credibly have access to the information they claim to have?Now both Julian Assange and I have stated definitively the leak does not come from Russia. Do we credibly have access? Yes, very obviously. Very, very few people can be said to definitely have access to the source of the leak. The people saying it is not Russia are those who do have access. After access, you consider truthfulness. Do Julian Assange and I have a reputation for truthfulness? Well in 10 years not one of the tens of thousands of documents WikiLeaks has released has had its authenticity successfully challenged. As for me, I have a reputation for inconvenient truth telling.Contrast this to the  credible sources  Freedland relies on. What access do they have to the whistleblower? Zero. They have not the faintest idea who the whistleblower is. Otherwise they would have arrested them. What reputation do they have for truthfulness? It s the Clinton gang and the US government, for goodness sake.The worst thing about all this is that it is aimed at promoting further conflict with Russia. This puts everyone in danger for the sake of more profits for the arms and security industries   including of course bigger budgets for the CIA.

"Dec 15, 2016","The Democrats have 26 more days to discredit Donald J. Trump until he becomes our next President. They are really pulling out all of the stops. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange emerges from hiding to do an interview with Fox News  Sean Hannity in order to set the record straight on the DNC leaks he released prior to the election. It s interesting how mainstream media  reporters  have no interest in the content of those undisputed leaked emails, they only care about how they got into the hands of Julian Assange.Julian Assange has finally spoken out on the recent news about intel assessments on Russia being the source of hacking designed to reportedly help Donald Trump. Julian Assange spoke with Sean Hannity on his radio show this afternoon and stated,  Our source is not the Russian government.  He told Hannity WikiLeaks did receive a little bit of information having to do with Trump and the RNC, but  it was already public somewhere else. https://youtu.be/GJIVOsptcBsHannity applauded Assange and said he s  done us a favor  by 1) showing how weak U.S. cybersecurity is, and 2) exposing government corruption. He asked Assange if the information he received came from inside the United States. Assange did not say definitively, but insisted,  It has not come from a state party.  (At a later point in the interview, Assange said that info leaks from other places could have been from Russia.) Hannity also asked him if President Obama knows this too and is  purposefully  pushing a false narrative to delegitimize Trump. Assange said yes. On Thursday afternoon, Hannity, the Fox News host and informal Trump adviser, once again interviewed WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange this time on Hannity s nationally syndicated radio show. Hannity gave Assange a large platform to deny that the source of the DNC and John Podesta emails was the Russian government, and to also join Hannity in some fairly typical bashing of Hillary Clinton and the  liberal  mainstream media. Hannity gushed on-air. Thanks to Assange and WikiLeaks s work, Hannity said,  we can now fix the problem  of our gaps in U.S. cybersecurity. (The DNC and Podesta emails were a wake-up call, in a sense.) Assange also  exposed the corruption in our government  for all to see.  I have so many questions for you,  Hannity said, before reminding his audience of WikiLeaks s  perfect  record:  You have not been proven wrong, not one single time,  he reiterated. When asked if President Obama was trying to  delegitimize Donald Trump by promoting any evidence of Russian interference and cyberattacks aimed at helping Trump to defeat Clinton in the election) Assange answered firmly,  yes.   This wouldn t be the first time that the CIA would be politicized,  Hannity continued, making a Benghazi analogy. Assange also wagged his finger at  the liberal press  in America that tried to make Trump voters feel  ashamed  of themselves for supporting the Republican candidate.  What is the difference between what you and WikiLeaks have done, and what The New York Times and CNN [have done]?  the host inquired.  Our stuff has more impact,  Assange replied.  Touch ,  Hannity answered.  I can t disagree with that.  The conservative host continued to make the case that the so-called mainstream media was  trying to scapegoat  Assange, and that  if [Hillary] were a Republican they d be singing your praises day and night.

"Dec 16, 2016","A new report from Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy analyzes news coverage during the 2016 general election, and concludes that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump received coverage that was overwhelmingly negative in tone and extremely light on policy.This is the final report of a multi-part research series analyzing news coverage of candidates and issues during the 2016 presidential election. The study tracks news coverage from the second week of August 2016 to the day before Election Day.Negative coverage was the order of the day in the general election. Not a week passed where the nominees  coverage reached into positive territory. It peaked at 81 percent negative in mid-October, but there was not a single week where it dropped below 64 percent negative.The press s negative bent is not confined to election politics (see Figure 4).[2] In recent years, when immigration has been the subject of news stories, the ratio of negative stories to positive ones has been 5-to-1. In that same period, news reports featuring Muslims have been 6-to-1 negative. News stories about health care policy, most of which centered on the 2010 Affordable Care Act, have been 2-to-1 negative. Although the nation s economy has steadily improved since the financial crisis of 2008, one would not know that from the tone of news coverage. Since 2010, news stories about the nation s economy have been 2-to-1 negative over positive.The real bias of the press is not that it s liberal. Its bias is a decided preference for the negative. As scholar Michael Robinson noted, the news media seem to have taken some motherly advice and turned it upside down.  If you don t have anything bad to say about someone, don t say anything at all. [3] A New York Times columnist recently asserted that  the internet is distorting our collective grasp on the truth. [4] There s a degree of accuracy in that claim but the problem goes beyond the internet and the talk shows. The mainstream press highlights what s wrong with politics without also telling us what s right.It s a version of politics that rewards a particular brand of politics. When everything and everybody is portrayed as deeply flawed, there s no sense making distinctions on that score, which works to the advantage of those who are more deeply flawed. Civility and sound proposals are no longer the stuff of headlines, which instead give voice to those who are skilled in the art of destruction. The car wreck that was the 2016 election had many drivers. Journalists were not alone in the car, but their fingerprints were all over the wheel.The research is confined to the election coverage in the print editions of five daily papers (the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and USA Today) and the main newscasts of five television networks (ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN s The Situation Room, Fox s Special Report, and NBC Nightly News). In the case of the newspapers, the analysis covers all sections except sports, obituaries, and letters to the editor. Op-eds and editorials are included, but letters from the public are not. For television, the analysis covers the full daily content of each network s major newscast. Network talk shows are not included.Trump s general election news coverage fit the pattern of earlier stages of the campaign in several respects but not all. The major departure was that his general election coverage was overwhelmingly negative in tone. In our earlier reports, we documented the positive coverage Trump received during the nominating stage of the campaign, a pattern largely attributable to the press s tendency to highlight the horserace in the pre-primary and primary periods. As Trump rose from single digits in the polls and then won key primaries, he got favorable press. It was a story of growing momentum, rising poll numbers, ever larger crowds, and electoral success. The fact that the horse race is the most heavily covered aspect of the nominating phase magnified Trump s favorable coverage.Trump s general election coverage was a stark contrast. His coverage was negative from the start, and never came close to entering positive territory (see Figure 8).  During his best weeks, the coverage ran 2-to-1 negative over positive. In his worst weeks, the ratio was more than 10-to-1. If there was a silver lining for Trump, it was that his two best weeks were the ones just preceding the November balloting. Trump s coverage was negative in all the news outlets in our study, even those that typically side with the Republican nominee (see Figure 9). Fox provided Trump his most favorable coverage, but it was still nearly 3-to-1 negative over positive. The Wall Street Journal was his next best outlet, but its coverage ran 4-to-1 negative. The most negative coverage was carried by CBS at 9-to-1, but Trump s coverage was nearly as negative in most other outlets.Compare to Hillary s coverage:To be sure, changes in journalism are not the only reason that campaigns have become more negative. The party polarization that has seeped into American politics during the past three decades has been accompanied by rising levels of partisan attack. But to claim that party polarization explains the media s negative bent is to ignore the fact that the press s negativity is not confined to party politics. There s barely an aspect of public life that is not subject to intense criticism.A healthy dose of negativity is unquestionably a good thing. There s a lot of political puffery, ineptitude, and manipulation that needs to be exposed, and journalists would be shirking their duty if they failed to expose it. Yet an incessant stream of criticism has a corrosive effect. It needlessly erodes trust in political leaders and institutions and undermines confidence in government and policy.Negative news has partisan consequences. Given that journalists bash both sides, it might be thought the impact would be neutral. It s not. For one thing, indiscriminate criticism has the effect of blurring important distinctions. Were the allegations surrounding Clinton of the same order of magnitude as those surrounding Trump? It s a question that journalists made no serious effort to answer during the 2016 campaign. They reported all the ugly stuff they could find, and left it to the voters to decide what to make of it.

Chutkan, an Obama appointee, recused herself on Monday from a case involving a dispute over subpoenas issued for Fusion GPS, the firm that commissioned the dossier.This Obama appointee is like so many others controversial. Change.org has a petition calling for her impeachmentA SUPPORTER COMMENT OF THE PETITION:  There is Clear and Present Danger, in our Government and to our Country. Judge Chutkin needs to do her duty, as Sworn by Oath, to let in ALL of the evidence pertaining to Imran Awan and Hina Alvi. As it stands today, 9/12/2017, Judge Chutkin is not doing her duty to protect the interests and lives of the Citizens of The United States. For this reason, I am standing with others, shoulder to shoulder, and calling for the Removal and Impeachment of Federal District Judge Tanya S. Chutkin. Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian tech executive accused in the dossier of hacking Democrats  computer systems, has sought to subpoena Fusion GPS records and to depose its employees to find out more about the research firm s work on the dossier.Gubarev is suing BuzzFeed for defamation for publishing the dossier earlier this year. He denies the allegations laid out in the document, which was written by former British spy Christopher Steele.Chutkan recused herself last month from another case involving Fusion GPS. The firm had filed suit against its bank, TD Bank, to keep it from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee, which sought Fusion s bank records.Chutkan presided over that case from Oct. 20 to Nov. 9. It was reassigned to Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee. Since taking over the case, Leon has indicated that he plans to allow more transparency into the court proceedings involving the battle over Fusion s bank records. He has ordered several documents be unsealed and made public.Chutkan has presided over the case involving the lawsuit against BuzzFeed since Aug. 31. Her replacement is Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee who assumed office in October.The reasons for Chutkan s recusals remain a mystery Chutkan refused to comment on the recusal but her work with a medical technology firm also represented by Fusion GPS could be the reason.In any case, this is yet another case of the Obama hand in just about everything that has to do with corruption and intel agencies.Read more: Daily Caller",JUST IN: Mystery Surrounds Obama Appointee Judge Who Recused Herself From Fusion GPS Case Also Handling DNC Corruption in Awan Brothers Case
"Dec 17, 2015","No dumb ass  we are actually NOT all Muslims! Last time I checked we were still a majority Christian nation, and no leftist clown is going to tell us otherwise!One thing you can say about Michael Moore he s consistently on the wrong side of every issue. The Left is more than happy to line his pockets, as long as he represents an anti-American position.Hyper-liberal Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker Michael Moore challenged Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump by holding a sign reading  We Are All Muslim  outside Trump Tower on Wednesday before penning an open letter to the candidate on Facebook.In his letter, Moore, who recently offered his Michigan apartment to Syrian refugees before inviting his fans to open their own homes, claimed he and Trump met on a talk show in 1998 and the billionaire businessman had asked him not to  go after  him. I thought, what are we, in 3rd grade?  Moore wrote.  I was struck by how you, a self-described tough guy from Queens, seemed like such a fraidey-cat. You and I went on to do the show. Nothing untoward happened between us. I didn t pull on your hair, didn t put gum on your seat.  What a wuss,  was all I remember thinking as I left the set. Moore added that Trump is now similarly afraid of Muslims, after proposing a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration to America  until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on. Moore wrote:And now, here we are in 2015 and, like many other angry white guys, you are frightened by a bogeyman who is out to get you. That bogeyman, in your mind, are all Muslims. Not just the ones who have killed, but ALL MUSLIMS.Fortunately, Donald, you and your supporters no longer look like what America actually is today. We are not a country of angry white guys. Here s a statistic that is going to make your hair spin: Eighty-one percent of the electorate who will pick the president next year are either female, people of color, or young people between the ages of 18 and 35. In other words, not you. And not the people who want you leading their country.The filmmaker then asked Trump to  leave the rest of us alone so we can elect a real president who is both compassionate and strong. We are all Muslim. Deal with it,  Moore concluded.Moore has become increasingly vocal about his dislike for the Republican frontrunner; last week, he invited Facebook followers to report Trump for  hate speech  in an effort to have him banned from the social media service.In an interview with the Daily Beast the day before his latest stunt, Moore said Trump should embrace his  female side. All men have estrogen in them. We all have a bit of estrogen in us. Sometimes, I ve noticed in our gender the guys who have to do a lot of huffing and puffing, they may be better embracing the female side of themselves,  Moore told the outlet.  They may be a little happier. He might be one of those people.

A scheduled hearing did not take place over the summer as planned and has not yet been rescheduled.In addition to the lawsuit, the family claims on its official website that it faces $250 per day in fines for continuing the show, citing  government interference  as being at the root of the dispute. Here s a portion of a petition that is posted on the  Hyatt Extreme Christmas  website:By signing this petition, you show your support for Hyatt Extreme Christmas, a 20 year-old tradition, which has been entertaining, inspiring and motivating families from around Plantation and South Florida.The Hyatt s take great joy in creating memories for children both young and old during this special time of year.

So he s setting up this kind of almost insurgency, picking people in foreign affairs, labor, abortion, union matters and setting them up to start appearing on television, making speeches and doing op-ed pieces for next four years, you re going to see not only a Trump Administration but you re going to see a shadow government opposing the Trump Klein said it was an insurgency by the left starting on Inauguration Day with the mass demonstrations organized by Michael Moore.

"Dec 19, 2015","The politically correct country of Sweden paying a very big price for their kindness, generosity and open-borders policy This attack happened in Norrmalmstorg, Stockholm. The two Swedes told them not to vandalize flowerpots   and as a response they got beaten up for it.https://youtu.be/Rsn_1TO1kMUThis is indeed the future of Europe. By their irresponsible, short-sighted, suicidal immigration and refugee policies, Europe s political and media elites have ensured a future of violence, bloodshed and chaos for their people. Sweden, the future of Europe: people stock up on fire arms, police recommend vigilante groups ,  by Nicolai Sennels, 10News.dk, December 12, 2015 (thanks to TheReligionofPeace.com):This is a very interesting read, because the whole of Europe is heading the same way as Sweden. Sweden is, so to speak, the future of Europe. And in this future, those who can afford it pay security companies   the rest gest license for firearms and forms vigilante groups. via: Pamela Gellar You have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places.    Salesman for alarm systems.Since Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by over 300% and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The violence at the hands of Muslim migrants  is nothing new to Sweden. This horrific video was published in 2013:Many Swedes see the mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him, even though he beats her and treats her badly. Her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated?    Alexandra von Schwerin, whose farm who was robbed three times. Police refused to help.Once upon a time, there was a safe welfare state called Sweden, where people rarely locked their doors.Now, this country is a night-watchman state   each man is on his own. When the Minister of Justice, Morgan Johansson, encourages breaking the law, it means opening the gates to anarchy. Mr. and Mrs. Swede have every reason to be worried, with the influx of 190,000 unskilled and unemployed migrants expected this year   equivalent to 2% of Sweden s current population. The number is as if 6.4 million penniless migrants who did not speak English arrived in U.S. in one year, or 1.3 million in Britain.And the Swedes are preparing: demand for firearms licenses is increasing; more and more Swedes are joining shooting clubs and starting vigilante groups. After a slight dip in 2014, the number of new gun permits has gone up significantly again this year. According to police statistics, there are 1,901,325 licensed guns, owned by 567,733 people, in Sweden. Add to this an unknown number of illegal weapons. To get a gun permit in Sweden, you need to be at least 18 years old; law-abiding; well-behaved, and have a hunting license or be a member of an approved shooting club. In 2014, 11,000 people got a hunting license: 10% more than the year before. One out of five was a woman. There is also a high demand for alarm systems right now,  says a salesman at one of the security companies in an interview with Gatestone. It is largely due to the turbulence we are seeing around the country at the moment.  People have lost confidence in the State, he added.  The police will not come anymore. Truck drivers say that when they see a thief emptying the fuel tank of their trucks, they run out with a baseball bat. It is no use calling the police, but if you hit the thief, you can at least prevent him from stealing more diesel. Many homeowners say the same thing: they sleep with a baseball bat under the bed. But this is risky: the police can then say you have been prepared to use force, and that might backfire on you. The salesman, who asked to remain anonymous, also spoke of Sweden s many Facebook groups, in which people in different villages openly discuss how they intend to protect themselves:  Sometimes you get totally freaked out when you see what they are writing. But you have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places. One blog, detailing the consequences for the local population when an asylum facility opens, is aptly named Asylkaos ( Asylum Chaos ). There is a list of companies the reader is prompted to boycott; the blog claims these businesses encourage the transformation of Sweden to a multicultural society, and are therefore considered  hostile to Swedes. At another security company, a salesman said that every time the Immigration Service buys or rents a new housing facility, his firm is swamped with calls.  The next day,  he said,  half the village calls and wants to buy alarm systems. Ronny Fredriksson, spokesman of the security company Securitas, said that the demand for home alarm systems first exploded about six years ago, when many local police stations were shut down and police moved to the main towns. This, he said, could result in response times of several hours.  More and more people now employ the services of our security guards. Shopping malls and stores in the city come together and hire guards. We are kind of like the  local beat  cops of old. Even though Securitas makes big money from the increased need for home security alarms and security guards, Fredriksson says they also are worried about the effect on society: The problem is that we too need the police. When our guards catch a burglar or a violent person, we call the police but the response times are often very long. Sometimes, the detainees get violent and quite rowdy. On occasion, the police have told us to release the person we have apprehended, if we have his identity, because they do not have a patrol nearby. Even before the massive influx of migrants in the fall of 2015, Swedes felt a need to protect themselves   and with good reason. Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by more than 300%, and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The politicians, however, ignore the people s fear completely. It is never discussed. Instead, the people who express concern about what kind of country Sweden has become are accused of xenophobia and racism. Most likely, that is the reason more and more people are taking matters into their own hands, and protecting themselves and their families to the best of their ability.All the same, some people do not settle for that. It seems some people are trying to stop mass immigration to Sweden. Almost every day there are reports of fires being set at asylum houses. So far, miraculously, no one has been hurt.These fires are set not only by Swedes. On October 13, a 36-year-old woman living in Skellefte  was convicted of setting fire to the asylum facility in which she herself resided. The woman claimed she lit a candle and then fell asleep. Yet forensic evidence showed that a combustible fluid had been doused throughout the room, and the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that she herself had ignited the fire.The number of violent incidents at Sweden s Immigration Service facilities is now sky-high. In 2013, according to Dispatch International, at least one incident happened every day. When Gatestone Institute recently acquired the incident list for January 1, 2014 through October 29, 2015, that number had risen to 2,177 incidents of threats, violence and brawls   on average, three per day.The Swedish government, however, would apparently rather not talk about that. Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr m conceded, in an interview with the daily Dagens Nyheter that garnered international attention, that Sweden is, in fact, heading for a systemic breakdown: Most people seem to think we cannot maintain a system where perhaps 190,000 people will arrive every year. In the long run, our system will collapse. This welcome is not going to receive popular support. We want to give people who come here a worthy reception. Symptomatic of Swedish journalists, this statement was tucked away at the end of the article. The headline was about how the political party that is critical of immigration, the Sweden Democrats Party (Sverigedemokraterna), is responsible for the asylum-housing fires. But foreign media, such as The Daily Mail and Russia Today, picked up Wallstr m s warning about a systemic collapse and ran it as the urgent news it actually is.Nevertheless, in official Sweden, the imminent collapse is ignored. Instead, journalists exclusively focus on attacks by supposedly  racist  Swedes on refugee centers. To prevent new fires, the Immigration Service decided on October 28 that from now on, all asylum facilities would have secret addresses. And meager police resources will now be stretched even further   to protect asylum seekers. Police helicopters will even patrol refugee centers. But considering there are only five helicopters available, and that Sweden s landmass is 407,340 square km (157,274 square miles), this gesture is effectively empty.At a meeting with the Nordic Council in Reykjavik, Iceland, on October 27, Sweden s Prime Minister, Stefan L fven, was questioned by his Nordic colleagues about the situation in Sweden. L fven had recently said that,  We should have the option of relocating people applying for asylum in Sweden to other EU-countries. Our ability, too, has a limit. We are facing a paradigm shift.  That comment led a representative of Finland s Finns Party (Sannfinl ndarna) to wonder, with a hint of irony, how mass immigration to Sweden, which for years Swedish politicians have touted as being so profitable, has now suddenly become a burden.Another Finns Party representative, Simon Elo, pointed out that the situation in Sweden is out of control.  Sweden has great abilities, but not even the Swedes have abilities that great,  Elo said.When L fven was asked how he is dealing with the real concerns and demands of the citizenry, his answer was laconic:  Of course I understand there is concern,  L fven said.  It is not easy. But at the same time   there are 60 million people on the run. This is also about them being our fellow men, and I hope that viewpoint will prevail. The daily tabloid Expressen asked L fven about the attacks on asylum facilities. He replied,  Our communities should not be characterized by threats and violence, they should be warm and show solidarity. As if such behavior can be forced.Many Swedes see mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him even though he beats her and treats her badly. And on top of that, her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him.More and more Swedish commentators are now drawing the same conclusion: that Sweden is teetering on the brink of collapse. Editorial columnist Ivar Arpi of the daily Svenska Dagbladet, wrote an astonishing article on October 26, about a woman named Alexandra von Schwerin and her husband. The couple lives on the Skarhults Estate farm in Sk ne in southern Sweden; they have been robbed three times. Most recently, they were robbed of a quad bike, a van and a car. When the police arrived, von Schwerin asked them what she should do. The police told her that they could not help her.  All our resources are on loan to the asylum reception center in Trelleborg and Malm ,  they said.  We are overloaded right now. So I suggest you get in touch with the vigilante group in Esl v. What the police had called a  vigilante group  turned out to be a group of private business owners. In 2013, after being robbed more or less every night, they had decided to come together and start patrolling the area themselves. Currently, they pay a security firm to watch their facilities. On principal, I am totally against it,  von Schwerin said.  What are the people who cannot afford private security to do? They will be unprotected. I m sure I will join, but very, very reluctantly. For the first time, I feel scared to live here now. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated? Commenting on the police s encouraging people to join vigilante groups, social commentator and former Refugee Ombudsman Merit Wager wrote: So, the Swedes are supposed to arrange and pay for their own and their families  security and keep their farms from being subjected to theft, even though that has up to now been included in the social contract   for which we pay high taxes, to have police we can count on to protect us and apprehend criminals?! When did the social contract expire? October 2015? Without any notice of termination, since the tax-consuming party is not fulfilling its part of the deal? This should mean that our part of the deal   to pay taxes for public, joint services   has also become invalid? If the social contract is broken, it is broken. Then it is musical chairs (lawlessness, defenselessness, without protection), and that means that each and every one of us should pay less taxes. Ilan Sad , lawyer and social commentator, wrote about the refugee chaos at Malm  Central Train Station on the blog Det Goda Samh llet on October 27:  The authorities no longer honor the social contract.  He described four large signs on display around the station that read  Refugee? Welcome to Malm !  in four different languages. It is unclear who the sender of the message is, or, for that matter, who is in charge of the reception facility   a number of barracks by the old post office in the inner harbor. Everything is utterly confusing. It could be Malm  City or the Immigration Service, but it might as well be  Refugees Welcome,  or possibly a religious community. I think to myself that a government agency could not reasonably write like this, a correct and pertinent sign would say something like:  Asylum seekers are referred to the barracks for information and further transport.  But I am probably wrong; Malm  City is the chief suspect communicant.   The signs in and around the Central Station are symptoms of something incredibly serious: Role confusion and the decay of the constitutional state. And thus, that our authorities no longer honor the social contract. In a post called Anarchy, blogger Johan Westerholm, who is a Social Democratic Party member and a critic of the government, wrote that the Minister for Justice and Migration, Morgan Johansson, is now urging authorities to  be pragmatic  about laws and regulations (concerning asylum housing for so-called unaccompanied refugee children). Westerholm stated that this is tantamount to the government  opening the gates to anarchy : Our country is founded on law; Parliament legislates and the courts apply these. Morgan Johansson s statement and his otherwise passive approach are testimony to how this, our kind of democracy, may fade into a memory very shortly. He now laid the first brick in the building of a state that rests on other principles. Anarchism. If anarchy really does break out, it would be good to remember that there are nearly two million licensed firearms in Sweden. Sweden s shooting clubs have seen a surge in interest; many are welcoming a lot of new members lately.

"Dec 19, 2016","While all of the mainstream media and anonymous CIA sources claim that Russia was behind the hacks of the emails from the Democratic National Committee and top Clinton aide John Podesta, the truth has been revealed to be completely different.By way of background, top American intelligence veterans say that it was a leak, not a hack.A New York Times report on Monday alluding to  overwhelming circumstantial evidence  leading the CIA to believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin  deployed computer hackers with the goal of tipping the election to Donald J. Trump  is, sadly, evidence-free. This is no surprise, because harder evidence of a technical nature points to an inside leak, not hacking   by Russians or anyone else.Monday s Washington Post reports that Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has joined other senators in calling for a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber-intrusion by Russia. Reading our short memo could save the Senate from endemic partisanship, expense and unnecessary delay.In what follows, we draw on decades of senior-level experience   with emphasis on cyber-intelligence and security   to cut through uninformed, largely partisan fog. Far from hiding behind anonymity, we are proud to speak out with the hope of gaining an audience appropriate to what we merit   given our long labors in government and other areas of technology. And corny though it may sound these days, our ethos as intelligence professionals remains, simply, to tell it like it is   without fear or favor.We have gone through the various claims about hacking. For us, it is child s play to dismiss them. The email disclosures in question are the result of a leak, not a hack. Here s the difference between leaking and hacking:Leak: When someone physically takes data out of an organization and gives it to some other person or organization, as Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning did.Hack: When someone in a remote location electronically penetrates operating systems, firewalls or any other cyber-protection system and then extracts data.Even the head of U.S. intelligence   James Clapper   testified on Monday that the connection between Russia and Wikileaks is weak. And U.S. intelligence agencies are now refusing to brief the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on whether or not Russia was actually the source of the Wikileaks documents.And the NSA executive who created the agency s mass surveillance program for digital information, who served as the senior technical director within the agency, who managed six thousand NSA employees, the 36-year NSA veteran widely regarded as a  legend  within the agency and the NSA s best-ever analyst and code-breaker, who mapped out the Soviet command-and-control structure before anyone else knew how, and so predicted Soviet invasions before they happened ( in the 1970s, he decrypted the Soviet Union s command system, which provided the US and its allies with real-time surveillance of all Soviet troop movements and Russian atomic weapons )   told Washington s Blog that the Democratic emails were leaked by either NSA insiders or DNC insiders.The former intelligence analyst, British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, and chancellor of the University of Dundee (Craig Murray) revealed earlier this week that the Podesta leak and the DNC leak were leaked by two different insiders, that both of the leakers were Americans with no ties to Russia, and that one was from the American intelligence services.Subsequently, Murray revealed further details on the leaks.Specifically, in an interview with Scott Horton on Tuesday, Murray said that   because John Podesta s company is a registered lobbyist for the Saudi Arabian government   the NSA and other intelligence agencies were monitoring their emails as a matter of course.Murray said that an insider from an American intelligence service (read: NSA) leaked the Podesta emails to Wikileaks. Indeed, an intermediary to the NSA whistleblower handed the emails to Murray in a park in Washington, D.C.Murray said that Wikileaks head Julian Assange tells him that the leaker of the DNC emails was a DNC insider.When asked if Seth Rich was the DNC leaker, Murray responded that he doesn t know   but that it s possible that Rich was murdered because someone thought that he was the source of the DNC leak.

Why is MSM covering this up? #Trump pic.twitter.com/FS297JooQI  ViveLaFrance (@vivelafra) December 11, 2016Again, NSA is able to identify both the sender and recipient when hacking is involved. Thanks largely to the material released by Edward Snowden, we can provide a full picture of NSA s extensive domestic data-collection network including Upstream programs like Fairview, Stormbrew and Blarney. These include at least 30 companies in the U.S. operating the fiber networks that carry the Public Switched Telephone Network as well as the World Wide Web. This gives NSA unparalleled access to data flowing within the U.S. and data going out to the rest of the world, as well as data transiting the U.S.In other words, any data that is passed from the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) or of Hillary Rodham Clinton (HRC)   or any other server in the U.S.   is collected by the NSA. These data transfers carry destination addresses in what are called packets, which enable the transfer to be traced and followed through the network.The bottom line is that the NSA would know where and how any  hacked  emails from the DNC, HRC or any other servers were routed through the network. This process can sometimes require a closer look into the routing to sort out intermediate clients, but in the end sender and recipient can be traced across the network.The various ways in which usually anonymous spokespeople for U.S. intelligence agencies are equivocating   saying things like  our best guess  or  our opinion  or  our estimate  etc.   shows that the emails alleged to have been  hacked  cannot be traced across the network. Given NSA s extensive trace capability, we conclude that DNC and HRC servers alleged to have been hacked were, in fact, not hacked.The evidence that should be there is absent; otherwise, it would surely be brought forward, since this could be done without any danger to sources and methods. Thus, we conclude that the emails were leaked by an insider   as was the case with Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. Such an insider could be anyone in a government department or agency with access to NSA databases, or perhaps someone within the DNC.For entire story Washington s Blog",REVEALED: Who Gave Democratic Emails To Wikileaks And Why They Were A Leaker And NOT A Hacker [VIDEO]
"Dec 2, 2015","Is this why we worked so hard to get a GOP majority in the House and Senate? Spineless weasels Republican House members blasted their GOP leadership Wednesday for caving to Democratic leaders  demand that they abandon the House s bipartisan bill to tighten screening of refugee applicants from Syria and Iraq. The bill to bolster the Syrian and Iraqi [refugee] vetting process passed with a veto-proof majority and is supported by a vast majority of Americans,  said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC)57% , who is one of the two co-authors of the original House bill that GOP leaders are now abandoning. It would be a shame to bow to the wishes of Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) and the White House, leaving our country vulnerable to foreign terrorism,  he told Breitbart News exclusively.After the Paris attacks that killed over 120 people, the House passed a bill   with a huge bipartisan majority   that would implement tough screening requirements for refugees. The bill was criticized by Democrats and President Obama, who vowed to veto the legislation and suggested that Republicans work with them to tighten oversight of visas given to legal visitors.Now, House Republican leaders are reportedly planning to abandon their original idea to tighten screening of refugees and are instead caving to Democrats who want to only fix security gaps in the legal-visitor visa program.Republican House leadership is backing away from the refugee problem because they fear their fix will be rejected by Democrats and lead to a partial government shut-down.Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) also told Breitbart News exclusively that he isn t  surprised  that Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) is following in the steps of former House Speaker Rep. John Boehner (R-OH)32% by bowing to Democrats, rather than putting up a fight.He called the original vote  a show vote  that was arranged by the leaders, and told Breitbart News that the entire refugee program needs to be stripped of its funding.Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) told Breitbart News exclusively that GOP House leadership should fix both problems.  This should not be an either or question,  Babin said.  Both should be addressed in a timely manner. We should concern ourselves first and foremost with the safety and security of the American people. Babin recently released a letter, signed by more than 70 of his colleagues, calling on House leadership to include language in the must-pass omnibus spending bill that would defund the refugee resettlement program. More than 70 of my colleagues joined me in calling for an immediate suspension in the refugee program to give us time to put in place security measures that the Administration has failed to implement  Babin told Breitbart News.

"Dec 21, 2015","Never mind that Iran continues to violate Obama s lopsided deal Senior Obama administration officials are expressing concern that congressional attempts to tighten laws preventing terrorists from entering the United States could violate the Iran nuclear agreement and prompt Tehran to walk away from the agreement.Congress is considering measures that would tighten the Visa Waiver Program to make it harder for potential terrorists to legally enter the United States by increasing restrictions on individuals who have travelled to countries with prominent terrorist organizations from bypassing security checks upon entering the United States.Iranian officials have in recent days repeatedly issued threatening statements to the Obama administration, saying that such moves would violate the nuclear agreement, and the Obama administration last week conveyed the Iranian anger to American lawmakers.Stephen Mull, the State Department official in charge of implementing the Iran deal, warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee late last week that these congressional efforts  could have a very negative impact on the deal. Under the revised law, which came in the week of a deadly terrorist attack in California, individuals who have travelled to Iran a lead sponsor of global terrorism would no longer be eligible to participate in the Visa Waiver Program, which permits individuals from 38 partner nations to more easily enter the United States.Congress remains concerned that gaps in the program could prevent federal law enforcement officials from detecting terror-tied individuals before they are granted entrance to U.S. soil.However, a portion of the Iran nuclear deal mandates that the United States not take any action that could harm Iran s economic relationships with other countries. Iranian officials maintain that the new restrictions violate this passage of the deal.Ali Larijani, the speaker of Iran s parliament, said last week that these tightened measures  are aimed at harassment  and that they  blatantly violate the nuclear agreement,  according to comments carried by the Iranian state-controlled press.Larijani warned that this action will detonate the deal before it has even been implemented. If the Americans pursue the plan, they will destroy an achievement with their own hands since it is against the [nuclear deal] and it will trouble them,  he warned.Rep. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) echoed these concerns last week when he questioned Mull during a Senate hearing.Visa waiver reform efforts include  a naming of Iran such that individuals who have travelled to Iran will no loner be eligible for the visa waiver program,  Murphy said.  There has been a suggestion because there is an element of the agreement that obligates us to not to take steps that would stop economic relations between other nations and Iran that we could perhaps be in jeopardy of breaching the agreement. Mull agreed with this assessment. I have heard from very senior, and Secretary [of State John] Kerry has as well, from very senior officials of differing European allies of ours that it could have a very negative impact on the deal,  he said.Sources working with Congress on the Iran deal criticized the Obama administration for attempting to stymie increased action on terrorism due to its desire to preserve the nuclear deal. According to the Obama administration s latest interpretation, the nuclear deal allows Iran to test ballistic missiles in violation of international law, but does not allow Congress to prevent terrorists from coming into the United States,  Omri Ceren, the managing director of press and strategy at The Israel Project, a D.C.-based organization that works with journalists on Middle East issues, told the Washington Free Beacon.Seyed Araqchi, Iran s deputy foreign minister, also warned that Iran is prepared to  take action  against the United States for implementing visa restrictions.Iran s latest threat to break the deal comes amid numerous Iranian provocations, including multiple tests of advanced ballistic missiles, acts prohibited under United Nations Security Council resolutions.The Obama administration repeatedly said that, while it does not agree with those launches, they do not violate the nuclear deal.Via: WFB",OBAMA WARNS: Crackdown On Terrorism In U.S. Would Violate Iran Deal

"Dec 22, 2016","Two days before the Berlin killings resurrected the darkest period in his life, Conrad Leslie says an unexpected message from a stranger on Facebook gave him and his wife a comfort unlike anything they had experienced since their son, a UC Berkeley student, died in the Nice, France, terror attack in July.The message, Leslie said, put to rest a recurring nightmare the couple had: a vision of their son s body on the promenade, alone for hours. In fact, a woman and her daughter had surrounded Nicholas Leslie s body with candles and prayed for him throughout the night, Leslie learned. Instead of running in fear, they asked the police if they could stay,  said Leslie of Del Mar (San Diego County).  It was a cold night, and they stayed with his body. It was like a Christmas story for us   a miracle almost. The Facebook message came from a French woman whose mother vacations in Nice every year. She said her mother ran into two women   also a mother and daughter   who told the story of finding a young man s body along the promenade and staying with him until first responders came.The woman who learned the story read an article in Le Monde that quoted Leslie as saying no one was with his son. But based on the description of the young man s body and the location of where he died as reported in the newspaper, she connected the dots and told her daughter, who speaks English, to track Leslie down at once.After they connected on Facebook, Leslie says he is now trying to track down the mother and daughter who stayed with his son s body. I just know they exist, and we re going to find them,  he said.Nicholas Leslie (pictured above), 20, was in France for a study-abroad program through UC Berkeley, where he studied business and environmental sciences. In the summer program, students were encouraged to develop their startup ideas. His was to create a way to measure lactic acid generation in athletes in real time.On the night of July 14, Nicholas Leslie and his friends were strolling down the Promenade des Anglais along the Mediterranean. The group had planned to watch the Bastille Day fireworks and get to bed early for a trip the next morning to Barcelona, Spain.Leslie said his son, with a long striding gait, was about 10 feet in front of his friends, who dived down to the beach when a man driving a cargo truck intentionally ran over dozens of people, killing 86. One friend swore he saw Nick run away. Later we found out it was probably PTSD,  Leslie said.  But that helped us get the strength to go to Nice to look for him. The uncertainty and pain were recalled in vivid detail Monday when a similar truck attack in a bustling Christmas market in central Berlin killed 12 people and injured dozens. A huge manhunt continued Thursday as German officials worked to track down the attacker. It just brings back the moment for us as parents. We felt the desperation, the pain,  Leslie said.  It s a new world we live in, and it s terrible. Leslie, an engineer and mostly lapsed Catholic, said the writings on death by the 18th century scientist Emanuel Swedenborg helped him cope. Although he s bothered when people tell him that his son s death was God s will or that Nicholas Leslie is in a  better place,  Leslie said he takes comfort in Swedenborg s idea that two angels carried his son to heaven, embodied by the mother and daughter who prayed over him.THE FAMILY OF NICHOLAS CREATED A SCHOLARSHIP IN HIS NAME: Nicolos Leslie Memorial Fundraiser Read more: sfchronicle",‘MIRACLE’ CONNECTION For Parents Of College Student Killed By Terrorists In France And Heroic Strangers

"Dec 23, 2015","Americans should pay close attention to this story, especially after Loretta Lynch announced the US Government will punish anyone for anti-Muslim speech.Journalist and writer  ric Zemmour has once again been fined   this time 3,000 euros   for inciting to hate Muslims. Le Parisien reports:Polemicist Eric Zemmour was sentenced on Thursday to a fine of 3,000 euros for provoking hatred towards Muslims, as a result of comments he made to the Italian daily Corriere della Sera in October 2014. In particular, he declared that the Muslims  have their civil code, it s the Koran,  that they  live among themselves in the suburbs. The French are forced to leave.  The prosecution had asked for a fine of 10,000 euros. I believe we re heading for chaos. This situation of a people in the people, of Muslims in the French people, will lead us to chaos and to civil war,  he added.  Millions of persons live here, in France, but refuse to live in the French manner. ric Zemmour was at the time promoting his book Le Suicide fran ais.Note: First, the use of the term  polemicist  to describe Zemmour is a deliberate attempt by the media to emphasize his  warlike  nature and his refusal to debate. The word evokes hostility and single-mindedness. Second, Zemmour s reference to a possible civil war preceded by fourteen months the statement by Manuel Valls, between the two rounds of the regional elections, that an FN victory would lead to civil war. No one prosecuted Valls. Third, there is an implication that Zemmour s words were intended to provoke in order to sell more books, since he was on a book tour in Italy.During the hearing in the Paris criminal court, the polemicist had maintained that he was speaking of  the Muslims in the suburbs who organize and who are planning to secede.  Prosecutor Annabelle Philippe deemed that his remarks that she regarded as  stigmatizing and without nuance , were aimed at the  totality of the Muslim community.  The court agreed stating that at no point in the interview did he reduce his comments to  just a fraction  of Muslims. The whole of Zemmour s remarks  rests on an eminently divisive assumption: that the Muslim community, in its essence and its culture, is in opposition to the French and to the French people,  said the judges. Claiming to relate an ineluctable evolution,  ric Zemmour proposes to his readers the only option capable, in his eyes, of avoiding civil war: an organized and forced departure from France of the entire Muslim community.  The court lambasted his  warlike and catastrophe-prone semantics  that denote  the conceptual passage from a probable reality to a solution at once credible and desirable. Note: So it is a crime in France to express a  credible  solution to a  probable  reality? It s a crime to even envisage a chaotic situation caused by Islamic doctrine?His lawyer Olivier Pardo, who plans to appeal, reacted:  The remarks made by  ric Zemmour before the November 13 attacks are today shared by a large part of those who voice their opinion. I cannot help but note the relentlessness to which he was subjected. The polemicist was also condemned to pay one or one thousand euros, depending on the case, in damages to the associations comprising the plaintiffs. To that will be added court costs, for a total of 13,003 euros.Note: Criminal and civil trials are combined here. While we would have a separate civil suit, in France the damages are meted out in the criminal court.The judges  decision  again has recognized that  ric Zemmour is a propagator of hatred,  deemed Sabrina Goldman, attorney for LICRA (International League against Racism and Antisemitism).  His words are all the more dangerous because he presents himself as the apostle of truth; he claims to tell the truth when in fact he only expresses hatred,  she declared. The president of SOS Racism, Dominique Sopo, expressed satisfaction that the justice system had reminded us that  freedom of expression is not freedom to spread hatred . He also said:  It makes you wonder again how he can hold such a position of authority in the media.

"Dec 25, 2015","So Bill Clinton wants a third term so much that he s coming out to battle Trump. Bringing Bill Clinton in to fight Hillary s battles could be a double edged sword. She might gain some momentum but it s hard to believe that Trump won t come after them with some zingers. The problem with the zingers is that they might earn Hillary some sympathy from the voters. I say that she should fight her own battles but don t you know Bill would love to be sitting in the White House a year from now  A new and more combative phase of Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign opens next month when she sends her husband out to stump for her in important early states.Waiting for him will be businessman Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner.The former president has been a low-key figure since Mrs. Clinton entered the race for the Democratic nomination in April, offering private advice and helping her raise money at closed-door fundraisers. In January, the campaign intends to showcase him in public forums in Iowa and New Hampshire, two states where the front-runner is locked in a tight race against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.Speaking to supporters recently, Mrs. Clinton described her husband as a  secret weapon. Throwing Mr. Clinton into the mix could further escalate the rhetoric between the Trump and Clinton campaigns. In the 2008 presidential race, the former president would bristle at criticism directed at his wife and got in hot water when he suggested Barack Obama s victory in the South Carolina primary was less significant because of the large African-American vote.This past week saw back-and-forth volleys over whether comments Mr. Trump made about Mrs. Clinton were sexist. He said Mr. Obama  schlonged  her in the 2008 race and said her brief absence from a recent Democratic debate stage, when she was reportedly using the restroom, was  disgusting. In an interview with the Des Moines Register, Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump has  demonstrated a penchant for sexism.  That drew a response from Mr. Trump on Twitter:  Hillary, when you complain about  a penchant for sexism,  who are you referring to. I have great respect for women.    In capital letters he then wrote,  BE CAREFUL! Asked what Mr. Trump meant, his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said:  Mr. Trump speaks for Mr. Trump and his tweets speak for themselves. And he s very clear about what those tweets say. Another Trump spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, suggested in an interview with CNN that the Trump campaign intends to make Mr. Clinton s behavior an issue should Mrs. Clinton pursue this point. Mr. Clinton, during his presidency, paid $850,000 to settle a sexual harassment case brought by Paula Jones stemming from an encounter when he was governor of Arkansas. His affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky led to his impeachment by the U.S. House in 1998. He was acquitted by the Senate the following year. Hillary Clinton has some nerve to talk about the war on women and the bigotry toward women when she has a serious problem in her husband,  Ms. Pierson told CNN. Representatives for Mr. Clinton and the Clinton campaign declined to comment.Mrs. Clinton holds a commanding lead among Democrats nationally, but polling shows the contests in Iowa and New Hampshire are up for grabs. Losses in both states could potentially alter the dynamics of a race she is dominating.In a conference call with supporters this past week, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said that Mrs. Clinton was in a  dog fight  in New Hampshire.Via: WSJ",Will Hillary’s ‘Secret Weapon’ Be A Game Changer For The Campaign?
"Dec 26, 2015","President Barack Obama has called the fight against human trafficking  one of the great human rights causes of our time  and has pledged the United States  will continue to lead it. If Obama really believed that human trafficking was such an important cause, then why would his State Department be working so hard to hide the truth about these horrific human rights violators? In the weeks leading up to a critical annual U.S. report on human trafficking that publicly shames the world s worst offenders, human rights experts at the State Department concluded that trafficking conditions hadn t improved in Malaysia and Cuba. And in China, they found, things had grown worse.The State Department s senior political staff saw it differently   and they prevailed.A Reuters examination, based on interviews with more than a dozen sources in Washington and foreign capitals, shows that the government office set up to independently grade global efforts to fight human trafficking was repeatedly overruled by senior American diplomats and pressured into inflating assessments of 14 strategically important countries in this year s Trafficking in Persons report.In all, analysts in the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons   or J/TIP, as it s known within the U.S. government   disagreed with U.S. diplomatic bureaus on ratings for 17 countries, the sources said.The analysts, who are specialists in assessing efforts to combat modern slavery   such as the illegal trade in humans for forced labor or prostitution   won only three of those disputes, the worst ratio in the 15-year history of the unit, according to the sources.As a result, not only Malaysia, Cuba and China, but countries such as India, Uzbekistan and Mexico, wound up with better grades than the State Department s human-rights experts wanted to give them, the sources said. (Graphic looking at some of the key decisions here: reut.rs/1gF2Wz5)Of the three disputes J/TIP won, the most prominent was Thailand, which has faced scrutiny over forced labor at sea and the trafficking of Rohingya Muslims through its southern jungles. Diplomats had sought to upgrade it to so-called  Tier 2 Watch List  status. It remains on  Tier 3    the rating for countries with the worst human-trafficking records.The number of rejected recommendations suggests a degree of intervention not previously known by diplomats in a report that can lead to sanctions and is the basis for many countries  anti-trafficking policies. This year, local embassies and other constituencies within the department were able to block some of the toughest grades.State Department officials say the ratings are not politicized.  As is always the case, final decisions are reached only after rigorous analysis and discussion between the TIP office, relevant regional bureaus and senior State Department leaders,  State Department spokesman John Kirby said in response to queries by Reuters.Still, by the time the report was released on July 27, Malaysia and Cuba were both removed from the  Tier 3  blacklist, even though the State Department s own trafficking experts believed neither had made notable improvements, according to the sources.The Malaysian upgrade, which was highly criticized by human rights groups, could smooth the way for an ambitious proposed U.S.-led free-trade deal with the Southeast Asian nation and 11 other countries.Ending Communist-ruled Cuba s 12 years on the report s blacklist came as the two nations reopened embassies on each other s soil following their historic d tente over the past eight months.And for China, the experts  recommendation to downgrade it to the worst ranking, Tier 3, was overruled despite the report s conclusion that Beijing did not undertake increased anti-trafficking efforts.That would have put China alongside the likes of Syria and North Korea, regarded by the United Nations as among the world s worst human right abusers.Typically, J/TIP wins more than half of what officials call  disputes  with diplomatic sections of the State Department, according to people familiar with the process. Certainly we have never seen that kind of an outcome,  said one U.S. official with direct knowledge of the department.ABILITY TO EMBARRASSThe Trafficking in Persons report, which evaluated 188 countries and territories this year, calls itself the world s most comprehensive resource of governmental anti-human trafficking efforts. Rights groups mostly agree.It organizes countries into tiers based on trafficking records: Tier 1 for nations that meet minimum U.S. standards; Tier 2 for those making significant efforts to meet those standards; Tier 2  Watch List  for those that deserve special scrutiny; and Tier 3 for countries that fail to comply with the minimum U.S. standards and are not making significant efforts.While a Tier 3 ranking can trigger sanctions limiting access to aid from the United States, the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, such action is frequently waived.The real power is its ability to embarrass countries into action. Many countries aggressively lobby U.S. embassies to try to avoid sliding into the Tier 3 category. Four straight years on the Tier 2 Watch List triggers an automatic downgrade to Tier 3 unless a country earns a waiver or an upgrade.The leverage has brought some success, including pressuring Switzerland to close loopholes that allowed the prostitution of minors and prompting the Dominican Republic to convict more child trafficking offenders.President Barack Obama has called the fight against human trafficking  one of the great human rights causes of our time  and has pledged the United States  will continue to lead it. But the office set up in 2001 by a congressional mandate to spearhead that effort is increasingly struggling to publish independent assessments of the most diplomatically important countries, the sources said.The rejection of so many recommendations could strengthen calls by some lawmakers to investigate how the report is compiled. After Reuters on July 8 reported on the plans to upgrade Malaysia, 160 members of the U.S. House and 18 U.S. senators wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry urging him to keep Malaysia in Tier 3, based on its trafficking record. They questioned whether the upgrade was politically motivated.Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, has threatened to call for a Senate hearing and an inspector general to investigate if top State Department officials removed Malaysia from the lowest tier for political reasons.The final decision on disputed rankings this year was made in meetings attended by some of the State Department s most powerful diplomats, including Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman and Kerry s Chief of Staff, Jonathan Finer, according to the sources. NO, NO, NO The unprecedented degree of discord over this trafficking report began to become clear after Reuters early last month revealed plans to upgrade Malaysia from the lowest Tier 3 rank to Tier 2 Watch List.The improved ranking came in a year in which Malaysian authorities discovered dozens of suspected mass migrant graves and human rights groups reported continued forced labor in the nation s lucrative palm oil, construction and electronics industries. As recently as April, the U.S. ambassador to Malaysia, Joseph Yun, urged the country to take prosecution of human trafficking violations more seriously.U.S. officials have denied that political considerations influenced Malaysia s rankings. No, no, no,  said Sewall, when asked by reporters last Monday whether Malaysia was upgraded to facilitate trade negotiations. She said the decision was based on how Malaysia was dealing with trafficking.Representative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who authored a 2000 law that led to the creation of J/TIP, said in an interview that the office s authority is being undermined by the president s agenda.  It s so politicized,  he said.If Malaysia had remained on Tier 3, it would have posed a potential barrier to Obama s proposed trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That deal is a crucial part of his pivot to Asia policy. Congress approved legislation in June giving Obama expanded trade negotiating powers but prohibiting deals with Tier 3 countries such as, at that time, Malaysia.Congressional sources and current and former State Department officials said experts in the J/TIP office had recommended keeping Malaysia on Tier 3, highlighting a drop in human-trafficking convictions in the country to three last year from nine in 2013. They said, according to the sources, that some of Malaysia s efforts to end forced labor amounted to promises rather than action.The analysts also clashed over Cuba s record with the State Department s Western Hemisphere Affairs Bureau, whose view took precedence in the final report.Human rights groups and people with knowledge of the negotiations over the rankings said an unearned upgrade for Cuba, especially at a time of intense attention due to the historic diplomatic thaw between Washington and Havana, could undermine the integrity of the report.Cuba had been on the  border line  for an upgrade in recent years, a former State Department official said. And although Cuba ended up with an upgrade, the final report remained highly critical, citing concerns about Cuba s failure to deal with a degree of alleged forced labor in medical missions that Havana sends to developing countries.China was another source of friction. J/TIP s analysts called for downgrading China, the world s second-biggest economy, to Tier 3, criticizing Beijing for failing to follow through on a promise to abolish its  re-education through labor  system and to adequately protect trafficking victims from neighboring countries such as North Korea. The final report put China on Tier 2 Watch List.SHOWING DEFERENCEBut the candor of J/TIP can run afoul of other important diplomatic priorities, particularly in countries beset by instability or corruption where U.S. diplomats are trying to build relationships. That leads every year to sometimes contentious back-and-forth over the rankings with far-flung embassies and regional bureaus   the diplomatic centers of gravity at the State Department. There is supposed to be some deference to the expertise of the office,  said Mark Lagon, J/TIP s ambassador-at-large from 2007 to 2009 and now president of Freedom House, an advocacy group in Washington. If the office is now losing more disputes over rankings than it is winning, that would be  an unfortunate thing,  he said.Most U.S. diplomats are reluctant to openly strike back at critics inside and outside of the administration who accuse them of letting politics trump human rights, the sources said.But privately, some diplomats say that J/TIP staffers should avoid acting like  purists  and keep sight of broader U.S. interests, including maintaining open channels with authoritarian governments to push for reform and forging trade deals that could lift people out of poverty.For entire story: Reuters","IS OBAMA’S RADICAL AGENDA Responsible For State Department’s Misleading Report On Forced Labor, Prostitution And Human Slavery?"
"Dec 26, 2016","Christmas the perfect time to pander to Muslims There is a reason his mother never let him be King. During a recent radio broadcast, Charles, Britain s Prince of Wales, told his listeners that Christians should give thoughts to the prophet Mohammed during this Christmas season.Clip via The Telegraph Normally at Christmas, we think of the Birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,  he said on Radio 4 s  Thoughts for the Day.   I wonder though if this year we might remember how the story of the nativity unfolds, with the fleeing of the holy family to escape violent persecution. The crown prince then likened that event to Mohammed traveling to Medina in search of converts. And we might also remember that when the prophet Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina he was seeking the freedom for himself and his followers to worship. Prince Charles then claimed that all religious groups want the same thing   the ability to live and worship in peace and to allow others to do the same. Whichever religious path we follow, the destination is the same   to value and respect the other person, accepting their right to live out their peaceful response to the love of God,  he said.The Prince of Wales then appeared to go after both president-elect Donald Trump s populist message as well as Great Britain s departure from the European Union based, in part, on the influx of immigrants from Middle Eastern Countries. We are now seeing the rise of many populist groups across the world that are increasingly aggressive towards those who adhere to a minority faith.

"Dec 27, 2016","THOMAS SOWELL:Avoiding the fatal mistake of disregarding the record of the pastAny honest man, looking back on a very long life, must admit   even if only to himself   being a relic of a bygone era. Having lived long enough to have seen both  the greatest generation  that fought World War II and the gratingest generation that we see all around us today makes being a relic of the past more of a boast than an admission.Not everything in the past was admirable. Poet W. H. Auden called the 1930s  a low dishonest decade.  So were the 1960s, which launched many of the trends we are experiencing so painfully today. Some of the fashionable notions of the 1930s reappeared in the 1960s, often using the very same discredited words and producing the same disastrous consequences.The old are not really smarter than the young, in terms of sheer brainpower. It is just that we have already made the kinds of mistakes that the young are about to make, and we have already suffered the consequences that the young are going to suffer if they disregard the record of the past.If you want to understand the fatal dangers facing America today, read The Gathering Storm by Winston Churchill. The book is not about America, the Middle East, or nuclear missiles. But it shows Europe s attitudes and delusions   aimed at peace in the years before the Second World War   which instead ended up bringing on that most terrible war in all of human history.Black adults, during the years when I was growing up in Harlem, had far less education than black adults today   but far more common sense. In an age of artificial intelligence, too many of our schools and colleges are producing artificial stupidity, among both blacks and whites.The first time I traveled across the Atlantic Ocean, as the plane flew into the skies over London I was struck by the thought that, in these skies, a thousand British fighter pilots fought off Hitler s air force and saved both Britain and Western civilization. But how many students today will have any idea of such things, with history being neglected in favor of politically correct rhetoric?You cannot live a long life without having been forced to change your mind many times about people and things   including, in some cases, your whole view of the world. Those who glorify the young today do them a great disservice, when this sends inexperienced young people out into the world cocksure about things on which they have barely scratched the surface.In my first overseas trip, I was struck by blatantly obvious differences in behavior among different groups, such as the Malays and the Chinese in Malaysia   and wondered why scholars who were far more well-traveled than I was seemed not to have noticed such things, and to have resorted to all sorts of esoteric theories to explain why some groups earned higher incomes than others.There are words that were once common but that are seldom heard any more. The phrase  none of your business  is one of these. Today, everything seems to be the government s business or the media s business. And the word  risqu  would be almost impossible to explain to young people, in a world where gross vulgarity is widespread and widely accepted.Back when I taught at UCLA, I was constantly amazed at how little so many students knew. Finally, I could no longer restrain myself from asking a student the question that had long puzzled me:  What were you doing for the last twelve years before you got here? Reading about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, and the widespread retrogressions of Western civilization that followed, was an experience that was sobering, if not crushing. Ancient history in general lets us know how long human beings have been the way they are, and dampens giddy zeal for the latest panaceas, despite how politically correct those panaceas may be.When I was growing up, we were taught the stories of people whose inventions and scientific discoveries had expanded the lives of millions of other people. Today, students are being taught to admire those who complain, denounce, and demand.The first column I ever wrote, 39 years ago, was titled  The Profits of Doom.  This was long before Al Gore made millions of dollars promoting global-warming hysteria. Back in 1970, the prevailing hysteria was the threat of a new ice age   promoted by some of the same environmentalists who are promoting global-warming hysteria today.Read more: National Review",THOMAS SOWELL’S FINAL COLUMN: “…too many of our schools are producing artificial stupidity”

Kramer was in hot water before for the same reason the Intel Committee is now issuing a subpoena:He was previously subpoenaed by the lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed. The guy just refuses to give out any information on sources for the  dirty  dossier. This raises the question of if there were sources that were fictional and were used just to build a fake case against Trump. President Trump just tweeted out that the dossier is a  pile of garbage . Could it be that this  pile of garbage  was used to make the case for a FISA warrant to spy on POTUS  The plot thickens on this one The Daily Caller reports: The House Intelligence Committee has issued a subpoena for an associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain s who revealed last week that he knows the names of the Russian sources used in former British spy Christopher Steele s infamous dossier.A congressional source tells The Daily Caller that California Rep. Devin Nunes issued the subpoena on Wednesday for David J. Kramer, a former State Department official.Kramer refused to divulge the names of Steele s sources during a Dec. 19 interview with the panel, the source says.Steele used Russian sources to gather information on the Trump campaign and Donald Trump s activities in Russia. The ex-spy was working for Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was on the payroll of the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE MCCAIN ASSOCIATE WHO REFUSED TO SPILL THE BEANS: Lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed for publishing the Steele dossier say that a longtime associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain and two major news outlets are resisting subpoenas seeking their depositions for the case.In a brief filed in federal court late Wednesday, lawyers for the executive, Aleksej Gubarev, claim that David Kramer (pictured below), a former State Department official and McCain associate,  has been seemingly avoiding service  of a deposition subpoena for weeks.Please see the very curious input Reason.com put out just this July regarding Kramer s involvement in the Steele dossier getting into the hands of the press. And The New York Times and Wall Street Journal are challenging deposition subpoenas they have been served as part of the case.Gubarev s lawyers are attempting to find out who gave BuzzFeed the salacious dossier, which the website published to much controversy on Jan. 10.The dossier, written by former British spy Christopher Steele, alleges that Gubarev and his companies, XBT Holdings and Webzilla, used spam, viruses and porn bots to hack into DNC computer systems. Gubarev vehemently denies the allegations.Gubarev s attorneys say that identifying BuzzFeed s source could shed light on whether the news outlet was warned that information in the dossier could be false. They argue that publishing the dossier despite such warnings would show  reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the information published. BuzzFeed has defended its decision to publish the dossier, which was financed by the Clinton campaign and DNC and commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS. It is also resisting demands from Gubarev s team to identify its dossier source on the grounds that it would violate its First Amendment protections as a news-gathering organization.Via: Daily CallerReason had this to say on July 16th on the mystery surrounding how the fake dossier got into the hands of Buzzfeed:Did John McCain and a controversial D.C. lobbying group conspire to get the infamous  pee dossier  into the hands of the press?A lawsuit making its way through court in the UK hopes to determine just what role the senator and his associates had in making the lurid dossier public.New filings in the lawsuit, obtained by McClatchy, detail how David Kramer employed by the nonprofit and purportedly non-political McCain Institute acted as a representative of McCain in the Arizona senator s dealings on sensitive intelligence measures:According to a new court document in the British lawsuit, counsel for defendants Steele and Orbis repeatedly point to McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal Trump critic, and a former State Department official as two in a handful of people known to have had copies of the full document before it circulated among journalists and was published by BuzzFeed.

"Dec 29, 2015","The drip drip drip of communism in the leftist state of California A new California law scheduled to take effect Friday will allow the police to seize private, legally-owned weapons for up to three weeks without charges or allowing the citizen to contest the seizure.AB1014 was passed last year in the wake of 2014 s Isla Vista shooting, where teenager Elliot Rodger went on a rampage near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, killing six people along with himself.Rodger s parents had reported him to the police prior to the shooting, concerned about his mental health and rants he posted online. But after meeting with Rodger, police decided he wasn t a criminal risk, and consequently didn t search his apartment, where he was stockpiling weapons and ammunition.The new law is intended to stop such a situation from re-occurring. Under the law, a judge has the power to grant a restraining order telling police to seize a person s guns, based solely on accounts from family members or police that the person is poses an imminent danger to others. The restraining order can be granted without the affected person knowing it exists or being allowed time to contest it.Under the law, the factors a judge can consider in granting the restraining order include not only threats of violence, but also prior felony arrests (even without a conviction), evidence of alcohol abuse, and even the simple act of recently purchasing a gun or ammunition.Once granted, police can use the restraining order to confiscate all of a person s guns and ammunition, and the person is also barred from buying or possessing guns and ammo for the duration of the order. A full court hearing must then be heard within three weeks. At that hearing, a judge will be able to extend the restraining order for an entire year. The law gives us a vehicle to cause the person to surrender their weapons, to have a time out, if you will,  Los Angeles Police Department Assistant Chief Michael Moore told Southern California Public Radio.  It allows further examination of the person s mental state. The law expands on California gun laws that are already some of the country s toughest. Police already have the power to seize a person s guns if a licensed therapist informs them that the person s mental state makes them a danger to themselves or others.

The  Best Practices for Inclusive Holiday Celebrations in the Workplace  holiday resource guide states that the public university  does not have an official policy regarding religious and cultural d cor and celebration in the workplace,  however,  we are fully committed to a diverse, welcoming, and inclusive environment. In order to  ensure your holiday party is not a Christmas party in disguise,  the Office of Diversity and Inclusion has come up with a list of ways for supervisors to encourage individuals to celebrate their own religions and cultures without allegedly excluding anyone or even being seen as  endorsing religion :Holiday parties and celebrations should celebrate and build upon workplace relationships and team morale with no emphasis on religion or culture. Ensure your holiday party is not a Christmas party in disguise.Consider having a New Year s party and include d cor and food from multiple religions and cultures. Use it as an opportunity to reinvigorate individuals for the New Year s goals and priorities. Supervisors and managers should not as well as, not be perceived as endorsing religion generally or a specific religion.If an individual chooses not to participate in a holiday party or celebration, do not pressure the person to participate. Participation should be voluntary.If a potluck-style party or celebration is planned, encourage employees to bring food items that reflect their personal religions, cultures, and celebrations. Use this as an opportunity for individuals to share what they brought and why it is meaningful to them.If sending holiday cards to campus and community partners, send a non-denominational card or token of your gratitude.Holiday parties and celebrations should not play games with religious and cultural themes. For example,  Dreidel  or  Secret Santa.  If you want to exchange gifts, then refer to it in a general way, such as a practical joke gift exchange or secret gift exchange.D cor selection should be general, not specific to any religion or culture. Identify specific dates when d cor can be put up and when it must come down.Refreshment selection should be general, not specific to any religion or culture.Most importantly, celebrate your religious and cultural holidays in ways that are respectful and inclusive of our students, your colleagues, and our university.

So, he s calling for tougher penalties for repeat gun offenders. It s painfully obvious more gun laws will do nothing.It s time Democrat ghetto hellholes like Chicago pay attention to what s happening in their pro-gun controlled cities instead of learning the hard way that criminals don t care what laws are on the books.

These grifters fade into the woodwork only to resurface when they reoffend.THE TOP 5 FOOD STAMP FRAUD CASES FROM 2017:The food stamp program is a federally-funded program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and federal investigators are most often the ones who catch those engaged in fraudulent activities..Investigators often uncover millions of dollars worth of food stamp fraud, mostly from people who run convenience stores in low-income areas where many patrons receive food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).To show how many millions of dollars these criminals have taken away from the federal government, here are the 5 biggest takedowns of food stamp fraud of 2017.IMMIGRANT FRAUD IS THE COMMON THREAD!1. Ohio Convenience Store Owner Sentenced to 33 Months in Prison for $2.8 Million in Food Stamp FraudA former Ohio convenience store owner got caught carrying out a $2.8 million food stamp fraud scheme where he allowed benefit recipients to exchange their food stamps for cash.The USDA revealed in an audit that the store, Breaden Market, cashed in on SNAP benefits more than ten times the amount of larger stores in the area, raising red flags among investigators.A judge eventually convicted and sentenced George Rafidi, 62, to 33 months in prison in February and ordered him to pay that $2.8 million back.2. Florida Investigators Discover More than $20 Million in Food Stamp FraudThe agency said it uncovered the majority of fraud when paging through SNAP benefit applications stating fraudulent household information.3. Baltimore Man Sentenced to Four Years for $3.7 Million Food Stamp FraudA Baltimore store owner got slapped with a four-year prison sentence for carrying out $3.7 million worth of food stamp fraud.Mohammad Shafiq, 51, was one of 14 other Baltimore-area retailers sentenced for $16 million worth of food stamp fraud, where they exchanged SNAP benefits for cash.The judge ordered Shafiq to pay back that $3.7 million to the federal government and serve three years of supervised release following the end of his sentence.4. Three Wisconsin Men Who Carried Out $1.2 Million Food Stamp Fraud Sentenced to Hard TimeA judge sentenced three Milwaukee, Wisconsin, convenience store owners Kanwar Gill, 67, Raviinder Gill, 27, and George Nance, 59 to prison terms ranging from 15-20 months in October after the three had been found guilty of exchanging cash for SNAP benefits.Their store, Quick N EZ, had been an authorized retailer that accepts food stamp benefits, but the $1.2 million in benefits the store redeemed was far beyond the amount the small convenience store was expected to redeem.Records show that all three men had been ordered to pay back the $1.2 million in fraudulently earned money. An Iraqi immigrant pleaded guilty to $1.4 million in food stamp fraud in November for conspiring with others to defraud the U.S. government.Ali Ratib Daham, 40, of Maine, gave customers cash in exchange for SNAP and Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) program benefits. He then redeemed the full value of the benefits to obtain more money from the government fraudulently.The naturalized U.S. citizen is expected to face a harsh prison sentence for his crime he faces up to 20 years behind bars and will most likely be expected to pay back the $1.4 million to the government.Via: Breitbart",TOP FIVE Food Stamp Fraud Takedowns of 2017…Do You See The Common Thread?
"Dec 31, 2015","Just another slap in the face to US citizens. Our government arranges massive payments to hostages taken by the terrorist nation of Iran, as they walk away unscathed .A fund of over $1 billion has been created for the U.S. embassy personnel taken hostage by Iran after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but it is the U.S. taxpayer, not Iran, who will be paying for it.The new fund, known as the  United States Victims of State Sponsors of Terrorism Fund,  was an addition to the omnibus bill put forward by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama Dec. 28. As much as $4.4 million could go to each of the 52 Americans held by Iran, with another $600,000 going to each spouse and child of the victims. The provision authorizes $1.025 billion from the Department of the Treasury to be used to pay for the new fund. Additionally, the legislation includes a 25 percent cap on any attorney s fees, which could lead to as much as $250 million total going to lawyers of the various victims involved.The victims were taken hostage during Iran s Islamic Revolution led by former Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Hundreds of student protesters stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran taking 52 U.S. personnel hostage for 444 days. Several months after the takeover, former President Jimmy Carter authorized Operation Eagle Claw, a rescue attempt by U.S. special operations forces which would later fail. The hostages would eventually be released after a lengthy negotiation process the day of President Ronald Reagan s inauguration in January, 1981. Victims of the embassy attack have been seeking compensation for their captivity for some time, but have been prevented from taking legal action against Iran. The 1981 Algiers Accords, the agreement which secured the release of the hostages, had a provision barring the victims from suing the Iranian government.  Iran is not paying the money, but it s as close as you can get,  says Thomas Lankford, an attorney for one of the victims, speaking to The Washington Post. Lankford refers to a clause in the new law which mandates that any money collected from the BNP Paribas scandal will be used for the new fund and the various 9/11 victim funds. The U.S. levied a fine of $9 billion on the French bank in June 2014 for its evasion of sanctions against countries like Iran, Cuba and North Korea.The staggering amount of compensation being paid to the victims is remarkably higher than the $262,000 suggested by the George W. Bush administration in 2003.

"Dec 31, 2016","President-elect Donald Trump played a round of golf at his Jupiter golf course Saturday morning   without notifying the traveling press pool that traditionally reports on his whereabouts. According to media reports, Trump headed to his Trump National Golf Club sometime in the morning. The golf course sits off Donald Ross Road about a half-hour drive north of Trump s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, where he and his family have been spending time for the Christmas and New Year s holidays. Mar-a-Lago was slated to host its lavish annual New Year s gala later Saturday.A club member tweeted a photo of Trump on the course, saying he was accompanied by about 25 Secret Service agents, The Associated Press reported.David Markus of Miami was spending some time at the golf club to celebrate the New Year s holiday when he and his family spotted Trump. He snapped a few photos of Trump, including one with Markus  three daughters taken near the club s pool. Markus said Trump started his golf game around 9:30 a.m. and ate lunch around 2 p.m. before leaving the club.Trump s golf outing was  a last-minute decision to play We are in the home stretch of this transition period and don t anticipate any additional situations like this between now and inauguration,  Grisham said in a statement to the AP.

How about we focus on the 1% of Pakistani s who are Christian that face daily persecution at the hands of Muslims?UPDATE: Tashfeen Malik posted a pledge of allegiance to ISIS before her deadly attack. She used a fake address on her passport.Via ABC:For the visa application, the address she listed in her Pakistani hometown, ABC News discovered today, does not exist. Malik received a her Green Card this summer, U.S. officials said.Tashfeen Malik, the female terrorist involved in the San Bernardino attack should have never been granted an American visa if the Immigration and Nationality Act holds any weight.Malik, who was found to have a Pakistani passport, obtained the K-1 visa in Islamabad, Pakistan. However, American visa laws that are meant to detect potential terror threats trying to infiltrate the country should have blocked the female jihadist from obtaining that visa.As the Center for Immigration Services notes, Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act states that  individuals who appear likely to overstay their temporary visas and try to settle permanently in the United States are not to be issued one. The regulation is meant to detect individuals seeking a visa who do not have permanent families in their home country and whether or not they have enough money to travel back to their home country once their visa is expired.This screening process is meant to expose individuals trying to to get into the country for the purpose of resettling permanently and overstaying their visa, as so many do.Nonetheless, Malik was able to obtain a visa in Islamabad despite the screening process which should have detected the fact that she was a young woman resettling in the US to potentially raise a family with her radical jihadist husband Syed Farook.Malik passed her DHS screening:Under Section 214(b), Malik should have been denied a visa, as there was ample evidence that she would overstay her visa.But, Malik could have obtained her visa the same way the 9/11 hijackers obtained theirs: through the  Visa Express  program.As reported by The Hayride, the Visa Express program allowed 9/11 hijackers Abdulaziz Alomari, Salem al Hamzi, and Khalid al Midhar to obtain their visas in Saudi Arabia without even being interviewed by consular officials at the American consulate.The terrorists simply obtained their visas by sending officials their applications and supporting documents through a designated travel agency.This allowed the three terrorists to go undetected despite red-flags that they were single, young men with not enough funds to return back to their home countries once their visas expired.Likewise, if Malik gained her visa through the  Visa Express  program at the American consulate in Islamabad, it would explain how she was allowed to enter the country despite overwhelming suspicions that she would overstay her visa.The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) admits that there are so many visas given out each year around the world that it is impossible to conduct background checks on every single person.And, we all saw what happened yesterday in San Bernardino.Via: Gateway Pundit",SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED To Step Foot On American Soil: How Female Terrorist Used Fake Info To Get US Visa

Guess who voted against it Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have left the lower court orders in place. Is anyone surprised by the two lefty judges?

Quick resolution by appellate courts would allow the Supreme Court to hear and decide the issue this term, by the end of June.Trump s travel ban has been challenged in separate lawsuits by Hawaii and the American Civil Liberties Union. Both have argued the ban discriminates against Muslims and should not go into effect under immigration laws.",JUST IN: SUPREME COURT Rules On Trump Travel Ban

He s a part of the Comey/McCabe group. He handled the Fake Trump Dossier inside the FBI alongside McCabe. He was hand-picked by Comey to run the Hillary e-mail investigation. He was also hand-picked by Mueller for the senior investigative staff. Coincidences like this simply don t exist .BURNING YOUR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS:The Department of Justice revealed on Tuesday that nearly $7 million has been spent so far on the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.The costs cover a five-month period from May 17, when the Department of Justice appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel for the Russia investigation, to Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year, CNN reports.Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentstein authorized the budget for the probe.The expenditures can be divided into two main categories: approximately $3.2 million spent by Mueller, and an additional $3.5 million spent on other Department of Justice components to support the investigation, including investigators from the FBI. Tuesday s revelation marks the first time the public has learned about how much taxpayer money has been spent on the Russia investigation.Congress has also been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, with multiple congressional committees conducting their own probes in both the House and Senate.Mueller s investigation has so far resulted in President Donald Trump s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the U.S., and the indictment of Trump s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, along with a longtime business associate.",THE DOJ TOOK $7 MILLION TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND STARTED A BONFIRE…’Russian Meddling’ Probe Goes off The Rails

"Dec 7, 2015","Bombs a-w oh, never mind Things must be going well in the  war on terror,  as the US Air Force just admitted that it is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS after  B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers.  As ZeeNews reports, Air Force chief of staff General Mark Welsh said as America ramps up its military campaign against the Islamist terror group, the Air Force is now  expending munitions faster than we can replenish them. The US Air Force is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq after its pilots fired off over 20,000 missiles and bombs since the US bombing campaign against the terror group began 15 months ago, its chief has said. As ZeeNews reports, B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers. F-15Es are in the fight because they are able to employ a wide range of weapons and do so with great flexibility. We need the funding in place to ensure we re prepared for the long fight,  Welsh said in the statement. This is a critical need,  he said.The bombing campaign has left the US Air Force with what an Air Force official described as munitions depot stocks  below our desired objective. The Air Force has requested additional funding for Hellfire missiles and is developing plans to ramp up weapons production to replenish its stocks more quickly. But replenishing that stock can take  up to four years from time of expenditure to asset resupply,  the official told CNN. The precision today s wars requires demands the right equipment and capability to achieve desired effects. We need to ensure the necessary funding is in place to not only execute today s wars, but also tomorrow s challenges,  the official said. As The Washington Times concludes, Russia has been bombing ISIS positions sporadically while France and Great Britain are now active in the American-led coalition which could relieve some pressure.Much larger potential adversaries like Russia or China most surely are following this development carefully. If the USAF cannot sustain a trickling battle against a poorly armed, medieval enemy, fighting a superpower military is obviously beyond its capability.Via: Zero Hedge","U.S. Air Force Runs Out Of Bombs To Drop On ISIS…Don’t Worry Though, Barry’s Got This"

"Dec 8, 2015","What does Obama, the Democrat Party, the state-run media and faux conservatives in Congress all have in common with Hamas? They all want to take down Trump TEL AVIV   Palestinian terrorist organizations did not take kindly to Donald Trump s call for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on. Responding to Trump s proposal, Ismail Radwan, a Hamas leader and spokesman in Gaza, told Breitbart Jerusalem:  We do not estimate that the current U.S. administration, any administration, will implement these racist suggestions. This is a pathetic attempt to attribute terror exclusively to Muslims. Radwan, whose group s charter calls for the murder of Jews and the destruction of Israel, lectured Trump:  Islam is a religion of peace, a religion which opposes bloodshed. Radwan glossed over Hamas  own long and sordid history of bloodshed in the name of Islam, including thousands of terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds of Israelis. Hamas has been responsible for suicide bombings, shootings, and rocket attacks targeting Israeli neighborhoods.Abu al-Ayna al-Ansari, a senior Salafi jihadist in the Gaza Strip, also sounded off to Breitbart Jerusalem on Trump s remarks.Supporters might argue that Trump s shutdown could stop future terrorist attacks. Ansari, however, claimed that, because of leaders like Trump,  the American people are risking more terrorist attacks from our brothers, fighters of the Islamic State. We Muslims have grown used to these types of statements, which prove that the U.S. under any president will continue to be hostile towards Muslims,  added Ansari.The jihadist went on to claim that Trump s sentiments exposed the  truth  about American leaders.  They claim to stand for human rights, while in actuality they carry out the same policy as that of the infidel crusading West, which oppresses the Muslims. Trump should know that a new generation of Muslims has risen, a generation that is capable of handling people like him and countries like the U.S.,  Ansari added.Speaking on ABC s  Good Morning America  on Tuesday, Trump clarified that under his proposal American Muslims can come and go as they please.Trump expressed his hopes that a shutdown  will go quickly,  as soon as  our leaders figure out what the hell is going on. If a person is a Muslim, goes overseas and comes back, they can come back. They re a citizen. That s different,  Trump explained.  But we have to figure things out. Speaking on CNN on Tuesday, Trump warned that the country risks more terrorist attacks if his plan for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration is not implemented. You re going to have many more World Trade Centers if you don t solve it   many, many more and probably beyond the World Trade Center,  Trump told CNN s Chris Cuomo.Trump speculated that there are already terrorists inside the country.  They want our buildings to come down; they want our cities to be crushed.   They are living within our country. And many of them want to come from outside our country. In a statement released to reporters on Monday, Trump cited a poll from the Center for Security Policy showing that segments of the Muslim population hold anti-American views.According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing  25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad  and 51% of those polled  agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah. Trump urged Americans to better understand the ideology of radical Islam before allowing Muslims into the country. Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.

"Dec 8, 2016","43 days and counting Characterizing the military s mission as a fight against  violent extremism,  Obama insisted that soldiers need to rise up against Trump if they feel he is pushing policies that are ill considered.Obama told the troops,  each of us has the universal right to speak your minds and to protest against authority; to live in a society that s open and free; that can criticize our president without retribution. Obama went on to insist that a proper U.S. policy against  violent extremism  is a  long term  policy. So rather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs or deploying more and more troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world,  Obama said,  we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat. And we have to pursue a smart strategy that can be sustained. In the time remaining, let me just suggest what I think should guide this approach. In addressing the war-torn Middle East, Obama insisted that global warming forms a large part of that conflict.  A changing climate is increasing competition for food and water,  which, he claimed, drives the conflict in Syria and other nearby nations.Obama also blamed the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution for  violent extremism  in the United States. Somebody who is trying to kill and willing to be killed is dangerous, particularly when we live in a country where it s very easy for that person to buy a very powerful weapon,  Obama insisted. The president also defended Islam against the charge of extremism:We are fighting terrorists who claim to fight on behalf of Islam. But they do not speak for over a billion Muslims around the world, and they do not speak for American Muslims including many who wear the uniform of the United States of America s military. If we stigmatize good patriotic Muslims, that just feeds the terrorists  narrative. It fuels the same false grievances they they use to motivate people to kill. If we act like this is a war between the United States and Islam, we re not gonna lose more Americans to terrorist attacks, but we ll also lose the sight of the very principles we claim to defend.As to the rise of ISIS, Obama insisted it was not given aide by his actions of pulling out of Iraq in 2011 but was instead given succor by the policies of George W. Bush. By 2011, Iraqis wanted our military presence to end, and they were unwilling to sign a new status of forces agreement to protect our troops from prosecution if they were trying to defend themselves in Iraq,  Obama proclaimed.  In addition, maintaining American troops in Iraq at the time could not have reversed the forces that contributed to ISIL s rise.

In contrast, Trump IS providing leadership. He knows some of his grand-standing is hot air. But he is articulating a sentiment held by millions and reinforcing himself as a protector of the American people.It s the reason Trump is the Republican front runner. He has spent just $330,000 on broadcasting to Jeb Bush s $42.5 million  which is indicative of how much America is enthralled by this new voice.I hear cries that he is a blithering idiot. I have often been called a deranged fool. But if this were true you could ignore me, ignore us, imaging the two of us shouting naked at the rain.It s because we articulate sentiments repressed by the politically correct consensus that we have a voice.Trump said:  We have places in London so radicalised that police are afraid for their lives. Within moments the Met Police, Prime Minister David Cameron, and the clownish Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, jumped to defend the reputation of the UK and distance themselves from this glaring truth.Yet, at the time of writing, no less than five bobbies on the beat have come forward to confirm that there ARE estates where they will only patrol out of uniform.There is fear among the police AND the public.I work with a team of cameramen in town who text their wives and partners on the hour to confirm they are safe.My family is not keen for me to be in the capital.Some friends will no longer come to London.How do you feel about the security of the city s shopping centres right now, after what happened in Paris?I watch the BBC news, our national broadcaster, ramming home messages of inclusiveness.Today they gave platform to a representative of the Muslim community telling Trump he is an Islamophobe and is not welcome here.But that s not my voice. That is not the voice of a nation. All Brits don t think that way.Being force-fed multi-culturalism brought us to this place. When the only permitted message is acceptance, any views to the contrary result in a label to shame you into silence.Racist! Islamophobe! Nazi!Don t just stick a label it. Be curious. Wonder, how has Trump come to articulate the views of a majority of Republicans across the States?Because I don t buy into the clear divide between extremist Muslims and peaceful ones. I don t see these as two separate entities. It is a sliding scale, a spectrum. From utterly peaceful, to ambivalence to sympathising, to extremist, to a man blowing up buses in Woburn Place.It is the same slippery slope which sees regular mosque attendees from Luton slip off to Syria to join ISIS. And suddenly a tight knit Muslim community knows nothing.Not the local imam, not local families, no one. No one denouncing terrorism. Just a wall of silence. In our country.Hate hidden behind walls we are told to accept and tolerate because we are multi-cultural. Repeat after me. Multi-cultural.History teaches us lessons were refuse to learn.The IRA would not have enjoyed decades of success without many among the Northern Irish Catholic population acting just the same way as the imams and family and friends of extremists in Luton today.We have gone too far and lost control of vast swathes of our country. In part we ARE a radicalised nation and it does nobody any favours to deny the obvious.Trump wants to call a temporary halt to Muslim immigration until America figures out what is going on.Adversaries may be quick to jump on Trump and make him the problem.But look around.

"December 1, 2017 ","BAMA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigeria s government has a plan for the northeast, torn apart by eight years of conflict with Boko Haram: displaced people will be housed in fortified garrison towns, ringed by farms, with the rest of the countryside effectively left to fend for itself. The vision for the state of Borno, ground zero for the war with the Islamist insurgency, is a stark admission of the reality in the northeast. For two years, the military and government have said Boko Haram is all but defeated, and the remnants are being mopped up.  But the military is largely unable to control territory beyond the cities and towns it has wrested back from Boko Haram. That means many of the nearly 2 million displaced people across the northeast cannot return to their homes in rural areas. Kashim Shettima, the governor of Borno state, said it was not possible for people to live in small villages.  There s beauty in numbers, there s security in numbers. So our target is to congregate all the people in five major urban settlements and provide them with means of livelihood, education, health care and of course security,  he told Reuters.  It s a long term solution, certainly.   The plan for the eastern part of the state, centered on the town of Bama, is intended as a pilot scheme to be rolled out in other parts of Borno if it is successful. Vigilantes, currently members of a group known as the Civilian Joint Task Force, will become agricultural rangers, the governor said.  Aided by Nigerian security forces, they will aim to secure and patrol a five-km (three-mile) radius around each garrison town where people can farm. Peter Lundberg, the United Nations Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria, who heads the organization s response in the northeast, said the reconstruction of Bama town, the second biggest in the state, was  logical .   People are very eager to go back if the conditions are right and if the conditions are safe, if the conditions are dignified, and of course it has to be voluntary,  he told Reuters. Sentiment amongst the displaced is mixed. Abubakar Goni, who lived outside Bama before fleeing to the Borno state capital Maiduguri, said he wants to return home, but if the town is safer he will agree to go there.  I will support it as long as I will have a place to farm. I am also happy to hear the government will give us protection on the farm because I learnt Boko Haram men are still around.  Others, like Tijja Modu Alhaji, are wary of potential disputes between residents of the towns where people will be sent and the returnees.  I don t want to stay in Bama because I will still be a stranger there, just as I am in Maiduguri now,  he said.  I want to go home, not to somebody else s land.  The governor s plan is still in its early stages. It involves bringing back thousands of people who fled the town of Bama and the surrounding area and sought refuge in camps in Maiduguri and elsewhere.  They will eventually be housed in towns such as Bama, which was largely abandoned by its inhabitants when Boko Haram took it three years ago, but has since been recaptured by the military. Many of Bama s buildings are still shells, windows smashed, doors ripped out and roofs gone. Telephone and electricity wires remain torn down, more than two years after the military evicted Boko Haram. It is not clear how the returnees will be housed. There are already 15,000 people in a crowded camp for displaced local residents set up by the military after it retook the town. The United Nations had planned to move them gradually to new shelters accommodating 30,000 people that have been erected in the town, but the military said it could not oversee two camps there at the same time, UN and military officials told Reuters. The government has announced plans to build 3,000 homes in the Bama area. But there are concerns about how people sent to the town will manage, since many did not originally live there.  It s one thing to move people to Bama,  said Lundberg.  Unless the engine of the economy can restart, the risk is that people are moving back to places where they will become very dependent (on aid).  Aid workers said the demarcation between garrison towns and a lawless countryside means people have a choice: live in virtual quarantine, or return to their homes in the countryside, where Boko Haram roam, and be treated by security forces as potential insurgency sympathizers.   You re imprisoned, but you re safe,  said one senior relief worker, speaking on condition of anonymity.  If you prefer your own life you can do it on the outside.  Boko Haram s recent attacks, including a suicide bombing that killed at least 50 in a mosque in Adamawa state last week, are the  last kicks of a dying horse,  Nigeria s Information Minister Lai Mohammed said last Sunday. But military and diplomatic officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said overstretched troops are unable to push Boko Haram out of non-urban areas. Much of Borno is not under the authorities  control and attacks are rife.  On Saturday, suicide bombers killed at least 13 people in the town of Biu and injured 53 others.  Borno is not getting better at all. It may have even gotten worse,  a diplomat said of the security situation outside urban areas.  There is no recovery and stabilization.

Enjoying a political breather after a year of ferocious domestic protests and damaging foreign sanctions, the 55-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez said the government had won at least 90 percent of the 335 mayorships in Sunday s election. Latest official results gave him 21 of 23 state capitals as well as Caracas  main district, with full results due later on Monday. The landslide win for the socialists was no surprise, given three of the biggest opposition parties did not field candidates.  The elections left Maduro favorite to be the socialist candidate in next year s presidential race, despite the ambitions of rivals within government and an economic crisis that has pummeled the OPEC nation since his 2013 election.  Let s get ready for 2018!  he told cheering supporters in a Caracas square shortly before midnight on Sunday, next to a statue of Venezuela s independence hero Simon Bolivar.  Maduro also declared fixing Venezuela s broken economy a priority. But opponents and even some government dissenters say it is his stubborn adherence to Chavez-era economic policies, such as currency controls, that is to blame for the crisis. Venezuela s 30 million people are enduring one of the worst economic meltdowns in recent Latin American history. Millions are skipping meals, missing medicines, and lining up for hours at shops during acute shortages and crippling inflation. Opposition parties said Sunday s vote was full of irregularities and meaningless, and reiterated demands for changes to the electoral system for the 2018 vote.   What we saw yesterday was an electoral farce that in no way represents the will of the people,  said Popular Will party leader Juan Andres Mejia, citing abuse of state resources and coercion of government employees to vote. MADURO  WELL-POSITIONED  FOR RE-ELECTION Three of the opposition coalition s main parties - Popular Will, Justice First and Democratic Action - boycotted Sunday s polls, saying the election board was a pawn of the government. But other opposition parties did put up candidates, adding to confusion and acrimony within opposition ranks.  Maduro said the three abstaining parties should be banned from participating in future elections. That brought a rebuke from the U.S. State Department, which called his remarks  another extreme measure to close democratic space in Venezuela and consolidate power in his authoritarian dictatorship.  Venezuela s presidential election has traditionally been held in December, but there is speculation in political circles that it will be brought forward to the first half of 2018 so the socialists can take advantage of the opposition s disarray.  Despite the regime s economic incompetence and the inherent weaknesses of Maduro s authoritarianism, he is well positioned to achieve re-election next year,  said Nicholas Watson, of the Teneo Intelligence consultancy. With its most popular leaders barred - Leopoldo Lopez is under arrest and Henrique Capriles is prohibited from office - the opposition may struggle to find a flagbearer. Uniting parties and reigniting enthusiasm among despondent grassroots supporters will also be huge challenges. Street protests earlier in 2017 put pressure on Maduro and left 125 people dead. Foreign pressure hardened too, with U.S. President Donald Trump imposing sanctions on Venezuela for alleged government rights abuses and corruption. Yet after facing down demonstrators, pushing through a controversial legislative superbody in a July vote also boycotted by the opposition, and notching a majority in October gubernatorial polls, Maduro has ridden out the storm for now.   I think the current government can fix things if they are allowed to get on with it,  said mechanic Melix Jordan, 56, voting for the government in a rural part of Paraguana. Social discontent is running deep, however. There is no sign so far of an alternative presidential candidate, despite calls in some quarters for popular billionaire businessman Lorenzo Mendoza to run.  My vote maybe doesn t change anything,  said gardener Hector Machado, 64, who voted for the opposition in Tachira state.  But I still have hope for something better next year.

"December 11, 2017 ","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European governments are complicit in grave human rights violations in Libya through their support for authorities there who often work with people smugglers and torture refugees and migrants, Amnesty International said on Tuesday. Amnesty said up to 20,000 people are now held in Libyan detention centers for migrants and are subject to  torture, forced labor, extortion, and unlawful killings . Other human rights organizations have said similar things in recent months. The European support for Libyan authorities is part of a plan to cut African immigration across the Mediterranean. It aims to lower the number of people who drown during the crossing and curb the scale of a political problem high arrivals cause to EU governments. Italy has spearheaded the plan, in particular by training and equipping the coastguard and by spending millions to back U.N. agencies working on relief efforts in Libya.  European governments have not just been fully aware of these abuses; by actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and containing people in Libya, they are complicit in these crimes,  said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International s head for Europe. On Tuesday, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni defended the EU s policy in a speech to parliament ahead of this week s meeting of the bloc s leaders in Brussels and said sea arrivals had dropped by two-thirds since last July.  It s thanks to us that a light is being shone on human rights in Libya,  he said, referring to million of euros Italy and the EU spent on improving conditions for people stuck there. A spokesperson for the bloc s executive European Commission said:  We are aware of the inhumane and terrible conditions some face. We share the same objective as Amnesty: saving lives.  It said the bloc s funding helped the U.N. agency for migration, the IOM, send more than 15,000 people in Libya to their home countries in Africa. At the same time, it said the bloc has also been slowly taking in  genuine refugees . Libya is the main gateway for migrants trying to cross to Europe by sea, though numbers have dropped sharply since July as Libyan factions and authorities have begun to block departures under pressure from Italy, the main landing point. More than 600,000 have made the journey over the past four years.   The EU backs Libya s coastguards in its efforts to intercept people heading to Europe but they work closely with people smugglers who torture people for money, Amnesty said.  By supporting Libyan authorities in trapping people in Libya ... European governments have shown where their true priorities lie: namely the closure of the central Mediterranean route, with scant regard to the suffering caused,  said Dalhuisen. Some EU officials and diplomats chafe at the bloc s reliance on militias that have emerged since the fall of Libya s leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.      But EU leaders will recommit at their meeting in Brussels on Dec. 14-15 to a strategy they say is bearing fruit in the form of fewer sea crossings.  The presidency of Libya s U.N.-backed government said last month it was a victim of illegal migration, not a source of it, and appealed to foreign powers to help stop flows from migrants  countries of origin.

"December 12, 2017 "," (This version of the December 12th story corrects headline and paragraph one to remove references to corruption) By Camillus Eboh ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria s court of appeal on Tuesday dismissed 15 charges against the Senate president related to alleged false declarations of assets, but it upheld three other charges against him. Bukola Saraki s three-year tenure as president of the upper house has been marred by numerous accusations of misconduct and investigations, though none have led to convictions. The original charges are related to allegations that Saraki falsely declared his assets when he was a state governor from 2003 to 2011, to which he pleaded not guilty. A Code of Conduct Tribunal cleared the Senate president of the charges in June, saying the case against him lacked substance. The government mounted a legal challenge which led to Tuesday s ruling by the court of appeal that Saraki should be retried by the tribunal on three of the 18 charges against him.  The three counts relate to Saraki s acquisition of two houses in Ikoyi, an upmarket district in the southern commercial metropolis of Lagos.   The appeal is dismissed in part in respects of the other 15 counts , said the judge, Tinuade Akomolafe-Wilson, at the appeal court in the capital Abuja. The Senate president s camp has previously denied any wrongdoing and on Tuesday issued a statement in which it said Saraki had been  victorious  due to the 15 charges being dropped. The full details of the judgement on the final three charges against Saraki have not been released and will be addressed by his lawyers once they have been, the Senate president said in a statement. Saraki ran unopposed for the post of Senate president, mainly with the backing of the opposition. He was not the ruling party s preferred candidate, which led to strains in his relationship with President Muhammadu Buhari. The Senate president has been dogged by legal cases since taking office.  In October 2016 Saraki was cleared of altering Senate rules to get himself elected, and in March this year lawmakers cleared him of any wrongdoing over allegations that he attempted to evade payment of customs duties on a car.

"December 13, 2017 ","MOSCOW (Reuters) - From Damascus to Doha, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has been showing up in unexpected places, a sign of the military s growing influence under Vladimir Putin. In the past few months, at times wearing his desert military uniform, Shoigu has held talks with Syria s president in Damascus, met Israel s prime minister in Jerusalem and been received by the Emir of Qatar in Doha. The defense ministry s forays into areas long regarded as the preserve of the foreign ministry are raising eyebrows in Russia, where strict protocol means ministers usually hold talks only with their direct foreign counterparts. The military is reaping political dividends from what the Kremlin saw as its big successes in Crimea, annexed from Ukraine after Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms seized control of the peninsula in 2014, and Syria, where Russian forces helped turn the tide of war in President Bashar al-Assad s favor.   That has translated into more top-table influence,  said a long-serving Russian official who interacts with the defense ministry but declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The Kremlin and the defense ministry did not respond to detailed requests for comment for this article, but three sources who know both ministries well confirmed the trend. The foreign ministry, in a Dec.15 statement to Reuters, said it was baffled by what it called assumptions it likened to  rumors and gossip.   The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the leading but not the sole government department involved in foreign policy making,  Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman, said in the statement.  Foreign policy making has long become a multi-faceted complex process involving many parts of government. One part of government seizing some kind of monopoly in international relations will not be beneficial and is hardly possible.  The military s increased influence has, however, caused discontent among some Russian diplomats and unease among Western officials about the harder edge it is giving Russia s foreign policy. Foreign policy-making has become more bellicose and more opaque, and this makes new Russian military adventures more likely, some Western officials say.   If you allow the defense ministry a bigger say in foreign policy it s going to be looking for trouble,  said one, who declined to be named because of the subject s sensitivity.  Shoigu s high profile has also revived talk of the long-time Putin loyalist as a possible presidential stand-in if Putin, who is seeking a fourth term in an election in March, had to step down suddenly and was unable to serve out a full six-year term. Shoigu, 62, is not involved in party politics but opinion polls often put him among the top five most popular presidential possibles. His trust rating is also often second only to Putin, with whom he was pictured on a fishing trip this summer.  The military s influence has ebbed and flowed in Russia and, before that, the Soviet Union.  It had huge clout at the end of World War Two and in the 1950s after the death of Soviet leader Josef Stalin when Georgy Zhukov, a commander credited with a crucial role in defeating Nazi Germany, was defense minister.  But the ignominious Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, completed in 1989, two wars Russia fought in Chechnya after the Soviet Union s collapse, and the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine with the loss of all 118 people on board in 2000 left the military s prestige in tatters. Under Putin, a former KGB agent who as president is the armed forces  commander-in-chief, its stock has risen. Defence spending has soared, the military has been deployed in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria and its actions are used to foster patriotism. The military s growing political and foreign policy muscle is most noticeable when it comes to Syria.  After going to Damascus twice earlier this year for talks with Assad, Shoigu was at Putin s side this week when the president flew in to meet the Syrian leader. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has not visited Syria at all in 2017. Unusually for a defense minister, Shoigu has been involved in diplomatic efforts to bring peace to Syria. In this role he has spoken about the importance of a new draft constitution for the country, met the U.N. special envoy on Syria and had talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. A Western official who has direct contact with the foreign and defense ministries said the Russian military had real heft in Damascus of a kind the foreign ministry did not. There was  strong mutual trust  between the Russian military  and senior people in Damascus, the official said, because  the Russians saved their asses and the Syrians respect that.  The foreign ministry retains strong Middle East experts and continues to play an important Syria role, helping run peace talks taking place in Kazakhstan. But Lavrov s own efforts to secure a U.S.-Russia deal on cooperating in Syria have shown how differently the foreign and defense ministries sometimes think. Lavrov is still seen as a formidable diplomat whom Putin trusts and respects. But Western officials say he is not summoned to all important meetings and is not informed about major military operations in Syria.  The military s other foreign policy interventions include a  role in Russia s alleged interference in last year s U.S. presidential election, U.S. intelligence agencies say. They say the GRU, Russia s military foreign intelligence agency, hacked email accounts belonging to Democratic Party officials and politicians, and organized their leaking to the media to try to sway public opinion against Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump s main rival.   The Kremlin denies the allegations. Other policy interventions included a news briefing in December 2015 at which the defense ministry said it had proof that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and his family were benefiting from illegal smuggling of oil from Islamic State-held territory in Syria and Iraq.  Erdogan said the allegations, made at a briefing held a week after a Turkish air force jet shot down a Russian warplane near the Syrian-Turkish border, amounted to slander.  The defense ministry s response to the incident was much sharper than that of Russian diplomats, part of a wide-ranging communications policy that has included frequent criticism of  the U.S. State Department and Washington s foreign policy. Other areas of interest for the defense ministry have included Egypt, Sudan and Libya.  Shoigu was involved in talks between Putin and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in Moscow last month and the ministry hosted Khalifa Haftar, Eastern Libya s dominant military figure, aboard its sole aircraft carrier in January. During the visit,  Haftar spoke to Shoigu via video link about fighting terrorism in the Middle East. One Western official told Reuters such incidents were fuelling fears that Russia plans to expand its footprint beyond Syria, where it has an air base and a naval facility, to centers such as Yemen, Sudan or Afghanistan. The military s influence in domestic policy-making has expanded too, Russian analysts and Western officials say, with Putin seeking its views on everything from the digital economy to food security. That is in part because Putin, since the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, has altered the way he takes decisions and widened the scope of what the Security Council, which he chairs, discusses to include many domestic policy questions.  At a time when there s a feeling that Russia is increasingly surrounded by enemies, Putin is consulting the intelligence services and the military more when he takes all decisions. He s meeting them all the time,  said Tatyana Stanovaya, head of the analytical department at the Center for Political Technologies think tank. Stanovaya said that did not mean the military was initiating ideas, but that its opinions were taken into account far more by Putin now than in the past and that it now had an important voice on domestic policy areas.

"December 14, 2017 ","LIMA (Reuters) - President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski s chances of surviving the political crisis gripping Peru faded on Friday after Congress passed a motion to start  presidential vacancy  procedures with enough votes to unseat him within a week. The opposition-controlled Congress voted 93-17 on Friday to seek his removal from office over graft allegations, which he denies. Eighty-seven votes will be needed to oust him in a session scheduled for Dec. 21, when he will be asked to defend himself. A Brazilian construction company at the center of Latin America s biggest graft scandal disclosed this week payments totaling $4.8 million to companies owned by Kuczynski or a close friend, triggering calls for him to resign. Kuczynski had previously denied any links to the Brazilian company, Odebrecht, and said on Thursday there was nothing improper about the payments. Flanked by his Cabinet, Kuczynski vowed not to resign in a defiant message to the nation. However, Kuczynski was aware his chances of surviving the scandal were slim, said a government source who asked not be identified. By resisting calls to step down, he hopes to clear his name and defend due process as the Odebrecht graft investigation widens, the source said.  This is a national disgrace,  said opposition lawmaker Lourdes Alcorta.  The less harmful option for Peru would be his resignation. He s forcing us to impeach him.  Odebrecht has rocked politics in Latin America since agreeing a year ago to provide details on bribery schemes across the region - landing elites in jail from Colombia to the Dominican Republic and nearly toppling a president in Brazil. Two former presidents in Peru, Ollanta Humala and Alejandro Toledo, have been ensnared in the Odebrecht probe over alleged payments they deny. Humala was jailed pending trial in July and authorities are seeking Toledo s extradition from the United States. Opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, whom Kuczynski unexpectedly defeated in last year s presidential election, is also under investigation and denies wrongdoing. If Kuczynski is forced out, he would be replaced by First Vice President Martin Vizcarra, a former governor of a copper-rich mining region and Peru s current ambassador to Canada. Kuczynski was once lauded by many as a brilliant technocrat who would help uproot widespread corruption in Peru. But his 16 months in office have been marked by clashes with the right-wing opposition party that controls Congress. Kuczynski said late on Thursday he was the owner, but not the manager, of a company paid by Odebrecht while he held senior government posts. He also acknowledged providing financial services for an Odebrecht project as a consultant for a friend s firm when he did not hold public office. The opposition slammed the explanation as too little, too late.  It s really unfortunate that President Kuczynski has put the country in this situation,  said congresswoman Cecilia Chacon.

"December 15, 2017 ","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria is set to become the only western European country with a far-right party in government after the anti-immigration Freedom Party and Sebastian Kurz s conservatives struck a coalition deal to share power almost equally. In an early policy pronouncement, Kurz, the future chancellor, said the new government would not hold a referendum on European Union membership. Kurz, who is just 31, and Freedom Party (FPO) leader Heinz-Christian Strache announced their deal on Friday night, handing the far right a share of power for the third time in the Alpine republic, after more than a decade in opposition.  The FPO will take control of much of Austria s security apparatus, in charge of the foreign, interior and defense ministries. The People s Party (OVP) led by Kurz will control the powerful finance ministry as well the justice and agriculture portfolios.  No one need be afraid,  Austrian news agency APA quoted the incoming interior minister and chairman of the FPO, Herbert Kickl, as saying. Kickl began his career as a speechwriter for the late Joerg Haider, who praised Adolf Hitler s employment policies and led the party to its first mainstream electoral success. Kurz will head the government as chancellor and the OVP will have eight ministries including his office. The FPO will have six, including Strache s office as vice chancellor. Kurz has repeatedly said his government will be pro-European despite including the FPO, which was founded by former Nazis and campaigned against Austria joining the bloc when it was put to a referendum in 1994.   The coalition plans to make referendums more widely available. Unlike France s National Front, the FPO has backed away from calling for a referendum on leaving the European Union but Kurz obtained a guarantee that a Brexit-style vote will not be held.      There will be no votes on our membership of international organizations, including the European Union,  Kurz told a joint news conference with Strache. Kurz s office will also take over some European departments from the FPO-run foreign ministry to give him greater control over EU matters. The 180-page coalition agreement listed plans such as sinking taxes and cutting public spending through streamlined administration though it often did not say how such goals would be achieved. Austria s parliamentary election two months ago was dominated by Europe s migration crisis, in which the affluent country took in a large number of asylum seekers.  Kurz s party won with a hard line on immigration that often overlapped with the FPO s, pledging to cut benefits for refugees and never to allow a repeat of 2015 s wave of arrivals. The FPO came third in the election with 26 percent of the vote. Kurz and Strache held their news conference outlining the agreement on the Kahlenberg, a hill on the outskirts of the capital famed as the site of the 1683 Battle of Vienna, which ended a siege of the city by Ottoman Turks. While there was no specific mention of repelling that Muslim invasion, the symbolism is clear for two parties that have warned Muslim  parallel societies  are emerging in Austria. Kurz, however, told reporters:  I did not take the decision on where the press conference should be held.... I would not read too much symbolism into it.  Strache and Kurz oppose Turkish membership of the EU, a position that polls regularly show most Austrians support.  We both recognize about 75 percent of ourselves in the program,  said Strache, who accused Kurz during the campaign of stealing his party s ideas.  That might have something to do with the fact that one or the other maybe took on the other s policy points before the election.   Anti-establishment parties have been winning over more voters in Europe, capitalizing on dissatisfaction with mainstream politicians  handling of the economy, security and immigration.  While other far-right parties have gained ground this year, entering parliament in Germany and making France s presidential run-off, the FPO is going further by entering government and securing key ministries.  It is excellent news for Europe,  Marine Le Pen said of the coalition deal at a Prague meeting of her National Front party s European grouping, which includes the FPO.  These successes show that the nation states are the future, that the Europe of tomorrow is a Europe of the people.  Both the OVP and FPO believe the EU should focus on fewer tasks, like securing its external borders, and hand more power back to member states. When the FPO last entered government in 2000 other EU countries imposed sanctions on Vienna in protest. There is unlikely to be a similar outcry this time, given the rise of anti-establishment parties across the continent. ",Austrian conservatives bring far right into government
"December 16, 2017 ","YANGON (Reuters) - A group of Myanmar journalists said they would begin wearing black T-shirts on Saturday in protest at the detention of two Reuters reporters accused of violating the country s Official Secrets Act, as pressure builds on Myanmar to release the pair. The Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists, a group of local reporters who have demonstrated against past prosecutions of journalists, decried the  unfair arrests that affect media freedom . In a statement on Facebook, the committee said its members would don black T-shirts  to signify the dark age of media freedom  in Myanmar. They demanded the unconditional and immediate release of the two reporters, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27.  Journalists all over the country are urged to take part in the Black Campaign,  the group said. It said it also planned to stage official protests and prayers. The group has staged several protests on behalf of arrested reporters from other media this year, including one in June in which around 100 journalists took part. It was not immediately clear how many journalists have joined the black T-shirt protest. The Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists was formed in response to the arrest in June of a newspaper editor over the publication of a cartoon that made fun of the military, said video journalist A Hla Lay Thu Zar - one of the group s 21-member executive committee.  A reporter must have the right to get information and write news ethically,  said A Hla Lay Thu Zar in reference to the case of the two Reuters  journalists. Myo Nyunt, deputy director for Myanmar s Ministry of Information, told Reuters the case had nothing to do with press freedom.  It s related to the Official Secrets Act,  he said.  Journalists should be able to tell what is secret and what is not... We already have press freedom. There s freedom to write and speak... There s press freedom if you follow the rules.  Asked about the local reporters   black campaign , he said:  Everyone can express his feelings.       The journalists were arrested on Tuesday evening after they were invited to dine with police officers on the outskirts of Myanmar s largest city, Yangon. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani, and government officials from Canada, Britain, Sweden, and Bangladesh, have all called for their release. The two reporters had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis that has seen an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims flee from a fierce military crackdown on militants in western Rakhine state. The Ministry of Information said the journalists had  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media , and released a photo of the pair in handcuffs. It said they were being investigated under the 1923 Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. Human rights advocates say press freedom is under attack in Myanmar, where the young civilian-led government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi shares power with the military that ran the country for decades. At least 11 journalists have been detained in 2017, although some have since been released. Police told Wa Lone s wife on Thursday that the reporters were taken from Htaunt Kyant police station in north Yangon by an investigation team to an undisclosed location shortly after their arrest. They added the reporters would be brought back to the station in  two to three days at most . It is now four days since they were detained. Separately, police lieutenant colonel Myint Htwe of the Yangon Police Division told Reuters on Thursday the reporters  location would not be disclosed until the investigation was complete.  Since then, the authorities have not provided any further information on their whereabouts. ",Myanmar journalists' group to don black T-shirts over arrest of Reuters' reporters
"December 17, 2017 ","(Reuters) - Myanmar has accused Reuters reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, of breaching the country s Official Secrets Act, a little-used hangover from colonial rule. Sam Zarifi, secretary general of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), said the law can ensnare working journalists  at any time . The two reporters were arrested on Tuesday evening after they were invited to meet police officers for dinner in the north of Yangon. The Ministry of Information said they had  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media , and published a photo of the pair in handcuffs standing behind a table with documents laid on it. The law dates back to 1923, when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was a province of British India. At the time British administrators worried that rival powers could seek to exploit anti-colonial unrest in its South Asian empire.  The act, which amended earlier anti-spying legislation, was controversial in India even at the time, according to a history published in 2009 by the United Service Institution of India, a New Delhi-based think tank. British military officers pushed for the stronger law over concerns about an  increase in Bolshevik activity , along with geopolitical threats including  the possibility of racial war between Japan and the USA affecting India , the history said. The Official Secrets Act covers trespassing in prohibited areas, handling documents deemed secret and communicating with  foreign agents . It carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. Zarifi of the Geneva-based ICJ - a human rights group made up of 60 senior international judges, lawyers and legal academics - said the definition of an official secret in the act is  incredibly broad .  Just about anyone in possession of unpublished government documents could find themselves facing prosecution and the harsh penalties a conviction may carry,  Zarifi said.  Under this law many good journalists could be prosecuted at any time.  In India, where the same law also remains on the statute book, courts have ruled that it even applies to parliamentary papers such as budget proposals if they are leaked before they are presented in the legislature. Legal experts say prosecutions under the act have been rare in Myanmar in recent decades.  The military junta that ruled until 2011 frequently used other laws or the Penal Code - also inherited from the colonial era - to lock up its critics alongside common criminals. The sprawling code was drafted in 1860, and gives magistrates more than 500 sections under which to charge alleged offenders. In 1990, a military court sentenced two leaders of the then opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) to 10 years in prison under the Official Secrets Act after they passed an official letter to foreign embassies. The prosecution was part of a broad crackdown following an election won by the NLD that the junta ignored.  They were freed in 1992, in an amnesty, according to a New York Times report at the time. Reports of at least two other cases brought under the act are recorded in the online archives of the Asian Human Rights Commission in 2009 and 2010.  The first case involved a man jailed for trespassing on military land and recording video footage to allegedly send abroad. He had been helping a farmer file a land grab complaint against the military. The second concerned a former army officer who was jailed in 2010 for allegedly having secret information on his laptop that he passed to foreign news agencies. The most well-documented recent case involving the Official Secrets Act came in January of 2014, when the Yangon-based weekly, Unity Journal, published a front page article it said exposed a secret chemical weapons factory run by the military in central Myanmar.  Police arrested the newspaper s CEO and four journalists involved in publishing the story, raided its offices, and attempted to seize all copies of the edition from newsstands. A civilian court in Pakkoku, near the alleged factory, sentenced them in July 2014 to 10 years in prison with hard labor - later reduced to seven years. The case was widely seen by the domestic media as a warning that military affairs remained off-limits even though direct military rule had ended. The  Unity Five  were released in an amnesty in April 2016, soon after the NLD, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, had come to power following an election in 2015. The Unity Journal subsequently closed.  Reuters was unable to reach government legal officials over the weekend and a Monday public holiday to request details of any other past cases in which the Official Secrets Act was used. Little is known of the allegations against the two Reuters journalists, other than that police said they were  arrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces  and are charged under Section 3 of the Official Secrets Act. Two policemen are also being investigated in the case, according to police. Section 3 covers entering prohibited places, taking images or handling secret official documents that  might be or is intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy . Human Rights Watch in 2016 said Section 3  defines the offence of  spying  extremely broadly .   Where a military establishment is involved, section 3(2) of the statute effectively places the burden on the defendant to prove that they are not guilty,  the group said. In May 2016, the month after Suu Kyi took power, the 1975 State Protection Act that had been used to keep her under house arrest for years was repealed. The Emergency Provisions Act, introduced in 1950 and frequently used against activists after the military seized power in a 1962 coup, was swept away in October the same year. But the Official Secrets Act and other laws, such as the 1908 Unlawful Associations Act, that have been used to jail journalists and activists, remain in force. Reuters was unable to reach Suu Kyi s spokesman to seek comment from Suu Kyi on the use of the Official Secrets Act to detain the two Reuters journalists.

"December 18, 2017 ","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Austria s new chancellor traveled to Brussels on Tuesday on his first foreign trip since being sworn in, aiming to dispel concerns that his coalition with the far right spells trouble for the European Union. Responding to a letter on Monday from European Council President Donald Tusk that underlined EU worries, 31-year-old conservative leader Sebastian Kurz tweeted back that his new government would be  clear pro-European and committed to making a positive contribution to the future development of the EU . A day after he took office at the head of a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), Kurz delivered that message in person to Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, whose EU executive has responded to October s election with little of the outrage that greeted the FPO s first taste of government in Austria 17 years ago.  At a joint news conference in Brussels, Juncker said he would judge Kurz s government by its deeds.   This government has a clear pro-European stance. That is what is important for me,  Juncker said. The FPO has distanced itself from its Nazi-apologist, anti-Semitic past, while surges in irregular immigration and militant attacks have pushed the European political mainstream rightward, leading to a much more muted reaction than in 2000. But a French member of the Commission was wary:  Things are doubtless different from the previous time, in 2000,  tweeted Socialist former finance minister Pierre Moscovici.   But the presence of the far right in government is never without consequences.  Confirmation of the FPO s return to a share of power raises concern that small, wealthy Austria will be an intractable voice on EU asylum reform and efforts to increase the EU budget. The bluntest criticism has been south of the Alps, where a plan to offer Austrian citizenship to people living in Italy s German-speaking border region has rekindled worries over old territorial arguments. A junior foreign minister in Rome said the offer may be couched in a  velvet glove of Europeanism  but bore  a whiff of the ethno-nationalist iron fist . Kurz assured Italians on Tuesday that he would consult Rome on the plan, which is a long-standing FPO policy, adding he would speak to Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. For an EU battered by mounting nationalism that goes well beyond Brexit, there is concern too that criticism of Brussels in Vienna may help fuel the euroscepticism of former communist member states in Central Europe, including Poland, where the Commission is seriously considering imposing sanctions that were initially designed in response to the FPO s rise early this century. Speaking in Brussels, Kurz said he would make it Austria s task to bridge the gap between EU member states in the east and the west, adding his country would fight to stop illegal immigration into the EU. In a letter of congratulation to Kurz, Tusk made clear his concerns about the new coalition in Austria:  I trust that the Austrian government will continue to play a constructive and pro-European role in the European Union,  Tusk wrote, noting that Austria will from July enjoy six months of influence in Brussels as chair of EU ministerial councils. Germany and France, the EU s lead powers, also indicated a vigilance about Austria in their comments on Monday which highlighted Kurz s pledges to foster European cooperation.     Kurz s visit to Brussels comes on the eve of an important Commission meeting on Wednesday, where Juncker s team will consider recommending sanctions on Poland for its continued  defiance of warnings that its new laws on the judiciary are contrary to EU democratic standards.  We are in a difficult process, which I hope will turn out to be a process of convergence. But not all bridges to Poland will be burnt tomorrow,  Juncker said.

"December 19, 2017 ","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The 193-member United Nations General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states on U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, sparking a warning from Washington that it will  take names.  Palestinian U.N. envoy Riyad Mansour said the General Assembly would vote on a draft resolution calling for Trump s declaration to be withdrawn, which was vetoed by the United States in the 15-member U.N. Security Council on Monday. The remaining 14 Security Council members voted in favor of the Egyptian-drafted resolution, which did not specifically mention the United States or Trump but which expressed  deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem.  Mansour said on Monday he hoped there would be  overwhelming support  in the General Assembly for the resolution. Such a vote is non-binding, but carries political weight. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, in a letter to dozens of U.N. states on Tuesday seen by Reuters, warned that the United States would remember those who voted for the resolution criticizing the U.S. decision.  The president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those countries who voted against us. We will take note of each and every vote on this issue,  Haley wrote.  She echoed that call in a Twitter post: The U.S. will be taking names.  Under a 1950 resolution, an emergency special session can be called for the General Assembly to consider a matter  with a view to making appropriate recommendations to members for collective measures  if the Security Council fails to act. Only 10 such sessions have been convened, and the last time the General Assembly met in such a session was in 2009 on occupied East Jerusalem and Palestinian territories. Thursday s meeting will be a resumption of that session.  Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital, generating outrage from Palestinians and the Arab world and concern among Washington s Western allies. Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. The draft U.N. resolution calls on all countries to refrain from establishing diplomatic missions in Jerusalem.  Haley said on Monday that the resolution was vetoed in the Security Council in defense of U.S. sovereignty and the U.S. role in the Middle East peace process. She criticized it as an insult to Washington and an embarrassment to council members. Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.

"December 2, 2017 ","CAIRO (Reuters) - Former Egyptian prime minister Ahmed Shafik, who returned home from the United Arab Emirates after announcing his bid for Egypt s presidency, appeared in Cairo on Sunday to say he was still considering his run in next year s election. Shafik s comments on a private Cairo television station came a day after his family said he had been taken from their home in the Emirates and deported back to Egypt, where they said they had lost contact with him until late on Sunday. Shafik, a former air force chief and government minister, has been seen by critics of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as the strongest potential challenger to the president, who is expected to run for a second term next year. Details about what happened to Shafik between his leaving the UAE on Saturday and his declaration on Sunday were unclear. He made a surprise announcement from the UAE last week that he planned to run in the 2018 election.  Today, I am here in the country, so I think I am free to deliberate further on the issue, to explore and go down and talk to people in the street,  he said on Sunday.  There s a chance now to investigate more and see exactly what is needed ... to feel out if this is the logical choice.  The interview on Dream TV was Shafik s first public appearance since leaving the UAE on Saturday. His family said earlier they feared he had been  kidnapped . Sources said he had been picked up by Egyptian authorities at Cairo airport.  Shafik dismissed reports he had been kidnapped. His lawyer, Dina Adly, wrote on her Facebook page that she had been able to see him at a Cairo hotel and said he was not subject to any investigations. She did not confirm whether he was able to leave the hotel or country.  I had a meeting with Shafik an hour ago at one of the hotels in New Cairo and confirmed his health,  Adly wrote on Facebook, referring to a suburban area of Cairo.  He confirmed that his health was good and that he was not subjected to any investigations,  she wrote. Shafik s family said earlier he had been taken from their home on Saturday by UAE authorities and flown by private plane back to Cairo.  We know nothing about him since he left home yesterday,  Shafik s daughter May told Reuters on Sunday before his reappearance.  If he was deported he should have been able to go home by now, not just disappear. We consider him kidnapped.  UAE authorities confirmed he left the Emirates but gave no details. A source at the Egyptian interior ministry said:  We do not know anything about Shafik. We did not arrest him and we did not receive any requests from the prosecution to arrest him or bring him back.  Shafik s abrupt departure from UAE came weeks after Lebanese officials accused Saudi Arabia of meddling by forcing Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to resign by holding him against his will.  Saudi Arabia denied those charges but the case prompted a crisis and pushed Lebanon back into the center of a regional struggle between Riyadh with its Sunni Gulf allies and Iran. Sisi is an ally of UAE and Saudi Arabia and his supporters say he is key to Egypt s stability. Critics say he has eroded freedoms gained after a 2011 uprising that ousted former leader Hosni Mubarak and jailed hundreds of dissidents. Sisi has won backing from Gulf states and has presented himself as a bulwark against Islamist militants since, as army commander, he led the overthrow in 2013 of former president Mohamed Mursi of the now banned Muslim Brotherhood. After four decades in the military, Shafik touted his military experience as one of his strengths in the 2012 vote. But he fled to the UAE to escape corruption charges in June 2012. He dismissed the charges as politically motivated and was taken off airport watchlists last year. In UAE, his family said he had round-the-clock security at home and informed authorities about his whereabouts. Soon after his announcement on Wednesday, he claimed he had been blocked from traveling, but his family later said he had been given assurances he could travel. Sisi has yet to announce his own intentions for the election. His supporters dismiss criticism over rights abuses and say any measures are needed for security in the face of an Islamist insurgency that has killed hundreds of police and soldiers. His government is struggling to crush the insurgency in the North Sinai region and has enacted painful austerity reforms over the last year which critics say have eroded his popularity.

"December 20, 2017 ","BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia s separatists look set to regain power in the wealthy Spanish region after local elections on Thursday, deepening the nation s political crisis in a sharp rebuke to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and European Union leaders who backed him. With nearly all votes counted, separatist parties won a slim majority in Catalan parliament, a result that promises to prolong political tensions which have damaged Spain s economy and prompted a business exodus from the region. Rajoy, who called the elections after sacking the previous secessionist government, had hoped Catalonia s  silent majority  would deal separatism a decisive blow in what was a de facto independence referendum, but his hard line backfired. The unexpected result sets the stage for the return to power of deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont who campaigned from self-exile in Brussels. State prosecutors accuse him of sedition, and he faces arrest if he were to return home.  Either Rajoy changes his recipe or we change the country,  Puigdemont, said in a televised speech. He was flanked by four former cabinet members that fled with him. At jubilant pro-independence rallies around Barcelona, supporters chanted  President Puigdemont  and unfurled giant red-and-yellow Catalan flags as the results came in. Puigdemont s spokesman told Reuters in a text message:  We are the comeback kids.  The result unnerved global markets, contributing to a softer euro and subdued sentiment in stock markets. Opinion polls had predicted secessionists to fall short of a majority. More than 3,100 firms have moved their legal headquarters outside Catalonia, concerned that the indebted region, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, could split from Spain and tumble out of the EU and the euro zone by default. Spain has trimmed its growth forecasts for next year, and official data shows foreign direct investment in Catalonia fell 75 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, dragging down national investment. The EU s major powers, Germany and France, have backed Rajoy s stance despite some criticism of his methods at times. On Oct. 1, when Catalonia staged an independence referendum, Spain declared it unconstitutional and national police used tear gas and batons to prevent some Catalans from voting. When Catalan parliament declared independence after the referendum, Rajoy invoked constitutional powers to impose direct rule from Madrid on the region. He has said he would rescind direct rule regardless of the election result, but could re-impose it if a new government again pursued secession. There was no immediate comment from Rajoy after the election results. The narrow victory for Puigdemont s secessionist camp presents a fresh headache for the EU, which had defended the Spanish judiciary s pursuit of separatist leaders on grounds that they had violated Spain s constitution. Puigdemont s attempts to gain international support in Brussels have come to nothing so far. He has called the EU a  club of decadent countries  for declining to mediate a solution. Separatist parties won 70 seats out of 135, with Puigdemont s Junts Per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) party retaining its position as the largest separatist force. Unionist party Ciudadanos (Citizens) won the most votes, but other unionist forces   Rajoy s People s Party and the Socialist Party   registered a dismal performance.  It s a bitter victory,  said Paloma Morales, a 27-year-old student at a Ciudadanos rally.  It means four more years of misery.  Analysts said the ball was back in Rajoy s court.  What this shows is that the problem for Madrid remains and the secession movement is not going to go away,  said Antonio Barroso, deputy director of research at London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence. Turnout on Thursday reached a record high with over 83 percent of eligible Catalans voting. Puigdemont s former deputy, Oriol Junqueras, and several other Catalan politicians are in prison, along with the leaders of the two main separatist grassroots movements.

"December 21, 2017 ","RUSAPE, Zimbabwe (Reuters) - The last time white Zimbabwean farmer Rob Smart left his land it was at gunpoint, forced out in June by riot police armed with tear gas and AK-47 assault rifles. He returned on Thursday to ululations and tears of joy from  former workers and their families who were also kicked out - a jubilant return and the first sign that the president who has replaced Robert Mugabe is making good on a vow to stop illegal land seizures and restore property rights. Scores of jubilant black Zimbabweans nearly knocked the 71-year-old off his feet as he and his two children stepped out of their car and onto their land for the first time in six months. Smart s case was taken up by Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe s then vice-president who heard of Smart s violent eviction while at an investment conference in Johannesburg.  Mnangagwa became president last month following a de facto coup that ended 93-year-old Mugabe s rule. In the latter half of his 37 years in power, Zimbabwe s economy collapsed, especially after the seizure of thousands of white-owned commercial farms under the banner of post-colonial land reform.  Land ownership is one of Zimbabwe s most sensitive political topics. Colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980 leaving many blacks effectively landless. Twenty years later, Mugabe authorized the violent invasion of many white-owned farms and justified it on the grounds that it was redressing imbalances from the colonial era. White farmers complained that well connected people used state security forces to force them off their farms, sometimes in the middle of harvesting, even after the Mugabe government indicated, some four years ago, that land seizures were over.  We are overjoyed, over the moon. We thought we would never see this day coming,  Smart s son, Darryn, told Reuters.  Getting back to the farm has given not just us, but the whole community hope that it s a new Zimbabwe, a new country.  Rob Smart, whose father said he started the farm from  virgin bush  in 1932, expressed confidence in the new government s pledge to protect the commercial farming sector, a mainstay of the struggling economy.  It s early days but so far what they (the new government) said they are going to do they are doing,  he told Reuters.  We just hope this whole incident will give hope to other farmers, who ve had the same situation.  Mnangagwa, who is under pressure to revive the economy ahead of elections next year, said on Thursday that he was resolute about the changes he was introducing.   There is no business as usual. Things have changed, it s a new era,  he said at a meeting with business leaders in South Africa.   I m from the military. If it s  left turn  then it s  left turn . If it s  right turn  it s  right turn . No confusion.  Mnangagwa s new agriculture minister, Perrance Shiri, last week ordered illegal occupiers of farms to vacate the land immediately, a move that could ultimately see some white farmers who say they were unfairly evicted return to farming. Shiri, a military hardliner who was head of the air force before being picked for the crucial ministry this month, called for  unquestionable sanity on the farms . For 83-year-old Anna Matemani, whose late husband worked on the farm, Smart s return was long overdue.   I m so happy he is finally back. He always helped us and the farm provides jobs for many of our young people,  said the grandmother of 15, who grew up and raised her children on the farm and witnessed Rob s birth, wiping away tears.  Some of the Smarts  joy subsided as they walked into their ransacked farmhouses.  The occupiers had looted property, including clothes, the children s toys, three guns, bottles of 100-year-old wine and Smart s late father Roy s medals from when he served with the Police Reserve Air Wing in the former Rhodesia.  I m sad about my grandfather s medals,  Darryn Smart said, surveying a ransacked room.  You can buy tables and chairs, you can t buy that family history. But thank goodness we re here.

"December 22, 2017 ","UNITED NATIONS/SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad. The U.N. resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and, in a last-minute change, demands the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad within 24 months, instead of 12 months as first proposed. The U.S.-drafted resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Council to further reductions if it were to conduct another nuclear test or launch another ICBM. North Korea on Nov. 29 said it successfully tested a new ICBM that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. Tension has been rising over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House. In November, North Korea demanded a halt to what it called  brutal sanctions , saying a round imposed after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 constituted genocide. U.S. diplomats have made clear they are seeking a diplomatic solution but proposed the new, tougher sanctions resolution to ratchet up pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  It sends the unambiguous message to Pyongyang that further defiance will invite further punishments and isolation,  Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said after the 15-0 vote. The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wu Haitao, China s deputy U.N. ambassador, said tensions on the Korean peninsula risk  spiraling out of control  and he  repeated Beijing s call for talks. China s foreign ministry said it hoped all parties would implement the resolution and urged all sides to exercise restraint. It also reiterated a call for what it calls a  dual suspension  proposal for the United States and South Korea to stop major military exercises in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs. South Korea welcomed the sanctions and called on the North to  immediately cease reckless provocations, and take the path of dialogue for denuclearization . North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, the United States and Japan, and says its weapons are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. On Friday, North Korea called U.S. President Donald Trump s recently released national security strategy the latest attempt to  stifle our country and turn the entire Korean peninsula  into an outpost of American hegemony. Speaking before the Security Council vote, analysts said the new sanctions could have a major effect on the North s economy.  The cap on oil would be devastating for North Korea s haulage industry, for North Koreans who use generators at home or for productive activities, and for (state-owned enterprises) that do the same,  said Peter Ward, a columnist for NK News, a website that tracks North Korea. The forced repatriation of its overseas workers would also cut off vital sources of foreign currency, he said. China, which supplies most of North Korea s oil, has backed successive rounds of U.N. sanctions but had resisted past U.S. calls to cut off fuel supplies to its neighbor. John Park, director of the Korea Working Group at the Harvard Kennedy School, said it was important to manage expectations about sanctions, which could take years to have a full impact while the North was making progress in its weapons programs at a pace measured in weeks and months.  If the game plan is to use sanctions as the last non-military policy tool to induce North Korea s return to the denuclearization table, we may quickly find Washington prioritizing military options,  Park said. The move to curb Chinese fuel exports to North Korea may have limited impact after China National Petroleum Corp CNPET.UL suspended diesel and gasoline sales to its northern neighbor in June over concerns it would not get paid. Business has slowed since then, with zero shipments of diesel, gasoline and other fuel from China in October.  Russia quietly boosted economic support for North Korea this year, and last week Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said Moscow was not ready to sign up to sanctions that would strangle the country economically. In a bid to further choke North Korea s external sources of funding, the resolution also seeks to ban North Korean exports of food products, machinery, electrical equipment, earth and stone, wood and vessels. It also bans exports to North Korea of industrial equipment, machinery, transport vehicles, and industrial metals as well as subjecting 15 North Koreans and the Ministry of the People s Armed Forces to a global asset freeze and travel ban. The resolution seeks to allow countries to seize, inspect and freeze any vessel they believe was carrying banned cargo or involved in prohibited activities. Even if the sanctions have an economic effect, it is not clear whether that would push Pyongyang to negotiate or stop its weapons development, said Kim Sung-han, a former South Korean vice foreign minister.  We have had numerous ... sanctions against North Korea over the past 25 years,  he said.  Almost none have worked effectively to halt the regime s military and nuclear ambitions.    ",U.N.

In Myanmar, those remanded must be brought to court within 14 days. But it s not immediately clear when the pair was first remanded and whether the authorities will seek court approval to remand them for a second 14-day period.

Seven Israeli players had requested visas for the tournament on Dec. 26-30. It would have marked the first time Saudi Arabia had publicly hosted Israelis as the Gulf state does not recognize Israel and there are no formal ties between them. Israel Gelfer, vice president of FIDE, whose Secretariat is based in Athens, told Reuters in an email that visas for the Israeli players  have not been issued and will not be issued . He said the tournament would go ahead as planned. It was not immediately clear if other delegations had been excluded but players from Qatar had suggested they may have been rejected. Saudi Arabia s Center for International Communication said in a statement that more than 180 players would participate but did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel Chess Federation Spokesman Lior Aizenberg said efforts were still being made  by various parties  to ensure the Israeli players took part.  The event is not a world championship if they prevent chess players from several countries from taking part,  Aizenberg told Reuters.  Every chess player should have the right to participate in an event on the basis of professional criteria, regardless of their passports, their place of issue or the stamps they bear.  Aizenberg said FIDE should ensure Israeli players could compete in international events and that the Israeli federation was considering all options, including legal action and holding an international competition in Israel for players excluded from the Saudi match.

"December 26, 2017 ","WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States announced sanctions on two of North Korea s most prominent officials behind its ballistic missile program on Tuesday, while Russia reiterated an offer to mediate to ease tension between Washington and Pyongyang. The new U.S. steps were the latest in a campaign aimed at forcing North Korea - which has defied years of multilateral and bilateral sanctions - to abandon a weapons program aimed at developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.  Treasury is targeting leaders of North Korea s ballistic missile programs, as part of our maximum pressure campaign to isolate (North Korea) and achieve a fully denuclearized Korean Peninsula,  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. The move followed new United Nations sanctions announced last Friday in response to North Korea s Nov. 29 test of an ICBM that Pyongyang said put all of the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. Those sanctions sought to further limit North Korea s access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad. North Korea declared the U.N. steps to be an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade. The standoff between the United States and North Korea has raised fears of a new conflict on the Korean peninsula, which has remained in a technical state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. The United States has said that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with North Korea. It says it prefers a diplomatic solution, but that North Korea has given no indication it is willing to discuss denuclearization. The U.S. Treasury named the targeted officials as Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol. It said Kim was reportedly a major figure in North Korea s efforts to switch its missile program from liquid to solid fuel, while Ri was reported to be a key official in its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) development.  The largely symbolic steps block any property or interests the two might have within U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit any dealings by U.S. citizens with them. With their ruling Workers Party, military and scientific credentials, the men are two of three top experts considered indispensable to North Korea s rapidly developing weapons programs.   Photographs and television footage show that the men are clearly among North Korean leader Kim Jong Un s favorites. Their behavior with him is sharply at variance with the obsequiousness of other senior aides, most of whom bow and hold their hands over their mouths when speaking to the young leader. Ri is one of the most prominent aides, and likely represents the Workers Party on the missile program, experts say. Born in 1948, Ri was partly educated in Russia and promoted when Kim Jong Un started to rise through the ranks in the late 2000s. Ri has visited China once and Russia twice. He met China s defense minister in 2008 as the air force commander and accompanied Kim Jong Il on a visit to a Russian fighter jet factory in 2011, according to state media.  Kim Jong Sik is a prominent rocket scientist who rose after playing a role in North Korea s first successful launch of a rocket in 2012. He started his career as a civilian aeronautics technician, but now wears the uniform of a military general at the Munitions Industry Department, according to experts and the South Korean government.  Many other details, including his age, are not known. On Tuesday, the Kremlin, which has long called for the United States and North Korea to negotiate, said it was ready to act as a mediator if the two sides were willing for it to play such a role.  Russia s readiness to clear the way for de-escalation is obvious,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Asked to comment on the offer, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Justin Higgins, said the United States  has the ability to communicate with North Korea through a variety of diplomatic channels , and added:  We want the North Korean regime to understand that there is a different path that it can choose, however it is up to North Korea to change course and return to credible negotiations.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who made a similar offer on Monday, told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Tuesday that  Washington s aggressive rhetoric  and beefing up of its military presence in the region had heightened tension and was unacceptable, his ministry said.  Lavrov underscored the need for  the fastest move to the negotiating process from the language of sanctions , it said. Another U.S. State Department spokesman, Michael Cavey, said Washington remained open to talks, but the onus was on North Korea  to take sincere and meaningful actions toward denuclearization and refrain from further provocations.  South Korea s Unification Ministry forecast on Tuesday that North Korea would look to open negotiations with the United States next year while continuing to seek recognition as a de facto nuclear power. The United States has stressed the need for all countries, especially Russia, and China - North Korea s main trading partner - to fully implement sanctions, including by cutting off oil supplies.  According to Chinese customs data, China exported no oil products to North Korea in November, apparently going above and beyond U.N. sanctions imposed earlier in the year. China also imported no North Korean iron ore, coal or lead in November, the second full month of those trade sanctions, the data showed.  China has not disclosed its crude exports to North Korea for several years, but industry sources say it still supplies about 520,000 tonnes, or 3.8 million barrels, a year to the country via an aging pipeline. North Korea also sources some of its oil from Russia. Trade between North Korea and China has slowed through the year, particularly after China banned coal purchases in February. Chinese exports of corn to North Korea in November also slumped, down 82 percent from a year earlier to 100 tonnes, the lowest since January. Exports of rice plunged 64 percent to 672 tonnes, the lowest since March. ","U.S. sanctions North Korean missile experts, Russia offers to mediate"

The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where - according to United Nations  estimates - about 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants. They were detained on Dec 12 after they had been invited to meet police officials over dinner. The Ministry of Information has said they  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media  and faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. The two journalists said they had not been mistreated in custody.    The situation is okay,  Wa Lone said after the hearing.  We will face it the best we can because we have never done anything wrong,  he said.  We have never violated the media law nor ethics. We will continue to do our best.  A Reuters spokesperson said they should be freed.  These two journalists are being held for simply doing their jobs and have done nothing wrong. It is time for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo to be released,  the spokesperson said. About 100 journalists, lawyers and farmers held a protest in the town of Pyay, 290 km (180 miles) north of Yangon, to demand the release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, one of the participants said. Members of the Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists sat draped in chains in a public square in the center of the town and wrote the names of the two arrested reporters on their palms, an often used symbol in Myanmar of solidarity with those in jail.  Government officials from some of the world s major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have previously called for their release. Dozens of reporters and cameramen were outside the courthouse in a northern district of Yangon for the appearance of the two journalists. They were brought in a white van, rather than a police truck, dressed in casual clothes and were not handcuffed.  Their lawyer, Than Zaw Aung, who has been retained by Reuters, also said the two had only been doing their job as journalists.  They are being accused under this charge while doing their work as media,  he told reporters. Lieutenant Colonel Myint Htwe, a senior staff officer from the Yangon Police Division, said:  We took action because they committed the crime. It needs to be solved in court.  Only their lawyer and the families of the two journalists,  along with police and government lawyers, were allowed into the courtroom. The families were later allowed to travel in the van as the two journalists were taken to prison.  I believe that he didn t commit any crime,  Pan Ei Mon, Wa Lone s wife, told Reuters.  I would like to request the government to consider releasing them.  Nyo Nyo Aye, a sister of Kyaw Soe Oo, said her brother told her he had not committed any offense.  I believe that he can come home soon,  she said. ","Reuters journalists in Myanmar appear in court, remanded for another 14 days"
"December 3, 2017 ","SIMI VALLEY, Calif (Reuters) - The U.S. agency tasked with protecting the country from missile attacks is scouting the West Coast for places to deploy new anti-missile defenses, two Congressmen said on Saturday, as North Korea s missile tests raise concerns about how the United States would defend itself from an attack. West Coast defenses would likely include Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missiles, similar to those deployed in South Korea to protect against a potential North Korean attack.   The accelerated pace of North Korea s ballistic missile testing program in 2017 and the likelihood the North Korean military could hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear payload in the next few years has raised the pressure on the United States government to build-up missile defenses.  On Wednesday, North Korea tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can fly over 13,000 km (8,080 miles), placing Washington within target range, South Korea said on Friday. Republican party Congressman Mike Rogers, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and chairs the Strategic Forces Subcommittee which oversees missile defense, said the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), was aiming to install extra defenses at West Coast sites. The funding for the system does not appear in the 2018 defense budget plan indicating potential deployment is further off.  It s just a matter of the location, and the MDA making a recommendation as to which site meets their criteria for location, but also the environmental impact,  the Alabama Congressman told Reuters during an interview on the sidelines of the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in southern California. After this story was published Congressman Rogers told Reuters in a statement he was  unaware of any effort by the Department of Defense to locate additional intermediate missile defense assets on the West Coast.  He added that his earlier comments to Reuters  should not be interpreted as confirmation of such an effort.  Reuters global head of communications, Abbe Serphos, said  We stand by our story.   When asked about the plan, MDA Deputy Director Rear Admiral Jon Hill  said in a statement:  The Missile Defense Agency has received no tasking to site the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense System on the West Coast.  The MDA is a unit of the U.S. Defense Department. Congressman Rogers did not reveal the exact locations the agency is considering but said several sites are  competing  for the missile defense installations. Rogers and Congressman Adam Smith, a Democrat representing the 9th District of Washington, said the government was considering installing the THAAD anti-missile system made by aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp, at west coast sites.  The Congressmen said the number of sites that may ultimately be deployed had yet to be determined. THAAD is a ground-based regional missile defense system designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles and takes only a matter of weeks to install.  In addition to the two THAAD systems deployed in South Korea and Guam in the Pacific, the U.S. has seven other THAAD systems. While some of the existing missiles are based in Fort Bliss, Texas, the system is highly mobile and current locations are not disclosed.  A Lockheed Martin representative declined to comment on specific THAAD deployments, but added that the company  is ready to support the Missile Defense Agency and the United States government in their ballistic missile defense efforts.  He added that testing and deployment of assets is a government decision. In July, the United States tested THAAD missile defenses and shot down a simulated, incoming intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). The successful test adds to the credibility of the U.S. military s missile defense program, which has come under intense scrutiny in recent years due in part to test delays and failures. Currently, the continental United States is primarily shielded by the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD) in Alaska and California as well as the Aegis system deployed aboard U.S. Navy ships. The THAAD system has a far higher testing success rate than the GMD. The MDA told Congress in June that it planned to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptors to the U.S. Army between October 2017 and September 2018, bringing total deliveries to 210 since May 2011. North Korea s latest missile test puts the U.S. capital within range, but Pyongyang still needs to prove it has mastered critical missile technology, such as re-entry, terminal stage guidance and warhead activation, South Korea said on Friday.

"December 4, 2017 ","SANAA/DUBAI (Reuters) - The powerful exiled son of Yemen s slain ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh vowed on Tuesday to lead a campaign against the Houthi movement that killed his father after he switched sides in the civil war. The intervention by Ahmed Ali Saleh, a former leader of the elite Republican Guard once seen as a likely successor to his father, gives the anti-Houthi movement in Sanaa a potential figurehead, after a week of fighting that saw the Houthis rout Saleh s supporters in the capital. Yemen s war, pitting the Iran-allied Houthis who control Sanaa against a Saudi-led military alliance backing a government based in the south, has brought what the United Nations calls the world s worst humanitarian crisis. The world body says millions of people may die in one of the worst famines of modern times, caused by warring parties blocking food supplies. Saleh had helped the Houthis win control of much of the country s north including Sanaa, and his decision to switch allegiances and abandon the Houthis in the past week was the most dramatic change on the battlefield in years. But the Houthis swiftly crushed a pro-Saleh uprising in the capital and shot him dead in an attack on his convoy. Tens of thousands of Houthi supporters staged a rally in the capital on Tuesday to show support for their leader and celebrate the death of Saleh. They chanted slogans against Saudi Arabia and its allies.  Mahmoud Ali al-Houthi, head of the movement s Revolutionary Committee, denied allegations that the group was executing members of Saleh s party after their capture:  We have been treating some of Saleh s sons and we haven t executed them,  he told the crowd.  Sanaa saw no fresh fighting on Tuesday after five days of combat that the Red Cross said killed more than 230 people. The Saudi-led coalition struck the city with 25 air strikes overnight, but U.N. and Red Cross aid flights were able to land at the airport, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Yemen Jamie McGoldrick said.  People are now emerging from their houses after five days being locked down basically as prisoners,  McGoldrick told a U.N. briefing by phone from Sanaa.  They are now seeking safety, moving their families in case things erupt again and at the same time seeking medical treatment and trying to pacify very terrified kids who have endured five days of relentless shelling, shooting and ground fire and air strikes.  The Saudi cabinet, in a statement that did not mention Saleh by name, said it hoped the Sanaa uprising against the Houthis would  help rid sisterly Yemen of repression, death threats, ... explosions and seizure of private and public property . The death of Saleh, who once compared ruling Yemen to dancing on the heads of snakes, deepens the complexity of the multi-sided war. Much is likely to depend on the future allegiances of his loyalists, who had previously helped the armed Houthi group, which hails from the Zaidi branch of Shi ite Islam that ruled a thousand-year kingdom in northern Yemen until 1962. In a statement sent to Reuters by an aide, his son said his father was killed at  the hands of the enemies of God and the country . Ahmed Ali said he would  confront the enemies of the homeland and humanity, who are trying to obliterate its identity and its gains and to humiliate Yemen and Yemenis . In an earlier statement carried by Saudi state media, Ahmed Ali said he would lead  the battle until the last Houthi is thrown out of Yemen ... the blood of my father will be hell ringing in the ears of Iran.  The Arabian peninsula s poorest country, Yemen is one of the most violent fronts in a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who have also backed opposing sides in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere across the Middle East.  The Saudi-led coalition appears to have been counting on Saleh s decision to switch sides to tip the balance of the war. Saleh, who ruled in Sanaa from 1978-2012, had a strong following in Yemen, including army officers and armed tribal leaders who once served under him. During the years the ex-president was allied to the Houthis, Yemeni political sources say Ahmed Ali was living incommunicado under house arrest at a guarded villa in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, where he had served as ambassador. The UAE is a key member of the mostly Gulf Arab alliance that sees the Houthis as a proxy of their arch-enemy Iran. The Gulf countries had struggled to make gains against the Houthi-Saleh alliance despite thousands of air strikes backed by Western arms and intelligence. They have used their air and sea power to tightly restrict imports, action that the United Nations says could lead to mass hunger. Ahmed Ali may be the family s last chance to win back influence. A nephew of the former leader, Tareq Mohammed Abdullah Saleh, a senior military commander, was also killed during clashes with the Houthis, Saleh s party said on Tuesday. Residents reported that fighting had subsided but that  Saudi-led coalition jets pounded several targets, including the downtown presidential palace where a governing body led by Houthi-Saleh politicians had regularly convened. The Houthi leader, Abdul Malek al-Houthi, hailed Saleh s death in a speech on Monday as a victory against a treasonous conspiracy by Yemen s Saudi enemies and called for Tuesday s mass rally at a parade ground near the site of the air strikes. In the southern city of Aden, where the Saudi-backed government is based, residents set off fireworks and expressed joy. Saleh was hated throughout southern Yemen after he launched a war to unify the country in 1994, lobbing ballistic missiles at the city. But his legacy is mixed. He is still loved in much of the north and many supporters will bear a grudge towards his killers. Some feared Saleh s death would only create more instability in Yemen.  We expect things will get worse for us. This will be the beginning of a new conflict and more bloodshed. The war will not end soon,  said Aswan Abdu Khalid, an academic at the psychology department at the University of Aden. ",Exiled son of Yemen's Saleh takes up anti-Houthi cause
"December 5, 2017 "," ((This Dec. 5 story corrects year in 2nd paragraph to 2011 from 2012)) By Michelle Nichols and David Brunnstrom UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman arrived in North Korea on Tuesday for a rare visit that some analysts and diplomats hope could spark a U.N.-led effort to defuse rising tensions over Pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs. The former senior U.S. State Department official is the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2011. During a four-day visit he is due to meet Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho to discuss  issues of mutual interest and concern.   This is broadly a policy dialogue with (North Korea). I think we have to wait and see what comes out,  U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Tuesday.  All key member states ... were informed and briefed of the visit.   U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told Russia, Japan, the United States, China and North and South Korea in August he was available to help broker talks. So-called six-party talks on North Korea s nuclear program stalled in 2008. A U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described expectations for Feltman s visit as  modest and high at the same time, meaning that they depend on what our hosts are thinking as well.   We need to find a way to scale back tensions,  the official said.  I don t think we will have a major breakthrough being announced at the end of this trip. But the visit could serve as a step to build a framework for engagement.  Suzanne DiMaggio of the New America Foundation think tank, a participant in recent unofficial talks with North Korea, said Feltman could propose during his visit to Pyongyang that Guterres play a mediation role.  I do think that the Trump administration would like to explore talks about talks at this stage. I think the North Koreans are assessing the timing of when to do that,  she told a  seminar in Washington on North Korea.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Feltman was not traveling on behalf of the U.S. government.  And he s not traveling - I want to make this clear - with any kind of message from the U.S. government ... He s going on behalf of the U.N., not the U.S. government,  she told a regular news briefing. Nauert said Washington remained open to talks if North Korea showed it was serious about giving up its nuclear weapons, but added:  The activities they have been engaged in recently have shown that they are not interested, they are not serious about sitting down and having conversations.   North Korea has been working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the United States in defiance of U.N. sanctions. It conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in September and last week tested a missile capable of reaching anywhere in America.  Feltman told the 15-member Security Council last week that its unity  creates an opportunity for sustained diplomatic engagement   an opportunity that must be seized in these dangerous times to seek off-ramps and work to create conditions for negotiations.  In September, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia urged a return to dialogue, including  by leveraging mediation efforts  by Guterres.  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said on Tuesday that Pyongyang was seeking dialogue with Washington on its nuclear program, according to RIA news agency. Morgulov, at a conference in Berlin, was quoted as saying Russia had communication channels with North Korea open and was ready to exert its influence on Pyongyang. Sweden s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Carl Skau told reporters he hoped Guterres could mediate in  probably the largest threat to international peace and security at the moment.  Britain s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Jonathan Allen said Feltman had  our backing and I think he goes to represent the U.N. family as a whole.  ",U.N. official's visit to North Korea sparks hope of mediation role
"December 6, 2017 ","ABUJA (Reuters) - A police official defended a unit of the Nigeria Police Force that has been accused of human rights violations, saying many claims of brutality were unfounded and the country needed to be defended against violent crime.  A social media campaign has called for the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) to be disbanded. It has gathered pace in recent days as people shared stories of alleged maltreatment by the unit s officers, as well as photographs and videos.  Lawmakers in the Senate, the upper house of parliament, voted on Tuesday to open an investigation into the allegations. Nigerian police have been dogged by accusations of human rights abuses for years. The police force has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.  When you check most of these allegations ... it is somebody else that is saying that something happened to another person,  said Abayomi Shogunle, who heads the Nigeria Police Force s complaints unit.   We have reached out to all these people: tell us who this victim is, tell us the place where it took place, tell us the date and time. They are not forthcoming,  said Shogunle, an assistant police commissioner. The social media campaign gathered pace after a video was circulated on social media of a youths chasing police after a man was allegedly shot dead by officers in the commercial capital, Lagos.  Reuters could not verify whether the incident took place or details of when and where the video footage was filmed.  The campaign, which has seen the EndSARS hashtag trending on Twitter, on Monday prompted the head of the police force to announce an immediate re-organisation of SARS nationwide and an investigation into abuse allegations. Shogunle said a specialist crime unit was needed in a country where kidnapping for ransom is a common problem in some regions, along with burglary. Clashes between semi-nomadic herdsmen and farmers over herding rights have also led to bloodshed in central and northern parts of the country. More than 30 people were killed in such clashes in a northeastern town last month.  The question is what do we replace them with? Who will perform those tough, difficult, life-threatening duties that SARS are performing at the moment?  he said.  Street protests are also being planned in Nigerian cities.   This has been going on for a long time and it s crazy that the people actually supposed to be your friend, to protect you, are the ones assaulting and abusing you,  said Charles Oputa, who is planning to hold an event in the capital, Abuja.  He said he did not believe the restructuring announced by the country s police chief would take place.  ",Nigerian police official defends unit against brutality accusations
"December 7, 2017 ","JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) - The Islamist group Hamas urged Palestinians on Thursday to abandon peace efforts and launch a new uprising against Israel in response to U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as its capital. Palestinian factions called for a  Day of Rage  on Friday, and a wave of protest in the West Bank and Gaza on Thursday brought clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops. At least 31 people were wounded by Israeli gunfire and rubber bullets, medics said.   The Israeli military said an aircraft and a tank had targeted two posts belonging to militants in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip after three rockets were launched at Israel. A jihadist Salafi group in Gaza called the Al-Tawheed Brigades - which does not heed the call from the enclave s dominant force, Hamas, to desist from firing rockets - claimed responsibility for the launches. The military said it was reinforcing troops in the occupied West Bank. Some protesters threw rocks at soldiers and others chanted:  Death to America! Death to the fool Trump!  Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Wednesday by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, angering the Arab world and upsetting Western allies. The status of Jerusalem, home to sites considered holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians, is one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.  We should call for and we should work on launching an intifada (Palestinian uprising) in the face of the Zionist enemy,  Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a speech in Gaza. On Friday s  Day of Rage,  rallies and protests are expected near Israeli-controlled checkpoints in the West Bank and along the border with Gaza. Friday prayers at the Muslim shrine of Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem could also be a flashpoint. Naser Al-Qidwa, an aide to Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and senior official in his Fatah party, urged Palestinians to stage peaceful protests. Abbas on Thursday met Jordan s King Abdullah, whose dynasty is the traditional custodian of Jerusalem s holy places. Jordan is a staunch U.S. ally but has dismissed Trump s move as  legally null . Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital. Palestinians want the capital of an independent state of their own to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognised internationally. No other country has its embassy there.  U.S. officials told Reuters that when Trump forewarned the Palestinian president of his intention to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, he assured him that a peace plan being put together would please the Palestinians. Trump s decision has raised doubts about his administration s ability to follow through on the peace effort that his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, has led for months aimed at reviving long-stalled negotiations. Israeli Housing Minister Yoav Gallant said he would next week bring to the Cabinet for approval 14,000 housing units, some 6,000 of which are slated for construction in areas in Arab East Jerusalem and are already at various planning stages.  Following President Trump s historic declaration, I intend to promote and reinforce building in Jerusalem,  Gallant said in a statement. Trump said on Wednesday that his administration would begin a process of moving the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a step expected to take years and which his predecessors had opted not to take in order to avoid inflaming tensions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Trump s announcement as a  historic landmark  and said many countries would follow the U.S. move and contacts were under way. He did not name the countries. The White House said it was not aware of any other country that planned to follow Trump s lead.  President Trump has immortalised himself in the chronicles of our capital. His name will now be held aloft, alongside other names connected to the glorious history of Jerusalem and of our people,  he said in a speech at Israel s Foreign Ministry. Close Western allies of Washington, including France and Britain, have been critical of Trump s move. The EU s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said Jerusalem must be the capital of both Israel and a future Palestinian state. A senior Palestinian official with Fatah said that U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, due to visit the region later this month, was  unwelcome in Palestine.  A spokesman for Pence said the vice president was planning to meet Abbas on the trip.  Deputy Palestinian U.N. envoy Feda Abdelhady-Nasser complained to the U.N. Security Council late on Wednesday about Trump s decision. The Security Council is likely to meet on Friday.  Haniyeh called on Abbas to withdraw from peacemaking with Israel and on Arabs to boycott the Trump administration. Abbas said on Wednesday the United States had abdicated its role as a mediator in peace efforts.   We have given instruction to all Hamas members and to all its wings to be fully ready for any new instructions or orders that may be given to confront this strategic danger that threatens Jerusalem and threatens Palestine,  Haniyeh said. Israel and the United States consider Hamas, which has fought three wars with Israel since 2007, a terrorist organisation. Hamas does not recognise Israel s right to exist and its suicide bombings helped spearhead the last intifada, from 2000 to 2005. Fearing disruption to reconciliation efforts between Hamas and Fatah, Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Al-Hamdallah and other Fatah delegates arrived in Gaza on Thursday to meet Hamas. Trump said his move, which fulfilled a campaign promise,  was not intended to tip the scales in favour of Israel and that any deal involving the future of Jerusalem would have to be negotiated by the parties. But the move was seen almost uniformly in Arab capitals as a sharp tilt towards Israel.    The United States is asking Israel to temper its response to the announcement because Washington expects a backlash and is weighing the potential threat to U.S. facilities and people, according to a State Department document seen by Reuters. In Lebanon, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah backed calls for a new intafada and said:  We are facing blatant American aggression.  Islamist militant group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said Trump s decision was the result of  normalisation steps  between some Gulf Arab countries and Israel. Protests have broken out since Trump s announcement in  Jordan, outside the U.S. consulate in Istanbul and in Pakistan. Thousands of Tunisians protested in several cities on Thursday.

"December 9, 2017 "," ((This Dec. 9 story corrects year in 2nd paragraph to 2011 from 2012)) By Jane Chung and Michelle Nichols SEOUL/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations political affairs chief told senior North Korean officials during a visit to Pyongyang this week that there was an  urgent need to prevent miscalculations and open channels to reduce the risks of conflict,  the world body said. Jeffrey Feltman, the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2011, met with Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho and Vice Minister Pak Myong Guk, the United Nations said in a statement on Saturday after Feltman arrived back in Beijing. Feltman emphasized the need for the full implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and that the international community was committed to achieving a peaceful solution.   He also said there can only be a diplomatic solution to the situation, achieved through a process of sincere dialogue. Time is of the essence,  the United Nations said.  They ... agreed that the current situation was the most tense and dangerous peace and security issue in the world today.  North Korea is pursuing nuclear and missile weapons programs in defiance of U.N. sanctions and international condemnation. On Nov. 29, it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile which it said was its most advanced yet, capable of reaching the mainland United States. North Korea said in a statement carried by its official KCNA news agency that expressed willingness to ease tension on the Korean peninsula and acknowledged the negative impact of sanctions on humanitarian aid to North Korea.  The United Nations expressed concerns over the heightened situation on the Korean peninsula and expressed willingness to work on easing tensions on the Korean peninsula in accordance with the U.N. Charter which is based on international peace and security,  KCNA said. KCNA said North Korean officials and Feltman agreed that his visit helped deepen understanding and that they agreed to communicate regularly.  Feltman did not speak to reporters upon arriving back from Pyongyang at Beijing airport on Saturday morning after spending four days in North Korea.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the situation on the Korean peninsula had entered a vicious circle of shows of strength and confrontation, and the outlook was not optimistic, China s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.  But at the same time it can be seen that hopes for peace have yet to extinguished. The prospects for negotiations still exist, and the option of resorting to force cannot be accepted,  Wang was quoted as saying.  The United States and South Korea conducted large-scale military drills this week, which the North said have made the outbreak of war  an established fact . Last month s missile test prompted a U.S. warning that North Korea s leadership would be  utterly destroyed  if war were to break out. The Pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after North Korean tests.  North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States and says its weapons programs are necessary to counter U.S. aggression.

"Feb 11, 2016","Maybe it s time for Muslim citizens and immigrants to start assimilating. What a concept Texas has just made a move that is sure to have many people cheering, and a select few angry. As the march to Sharia Law presses on, it appears Texas is fighting back.Over the past few years, Texas has been quick to take a stand against President Obama and implement the laws necessary to protect its citizens. Now, the Texas legislature has just passed a law designed to permanent bar Muslims from instituting Sharia Law in the Lone Star State.While State Sen. Donna Campbell doesn t specific measure Islamic law in the bill, her measure guarantees that no laws from  foreign courts  will be admissible by Texas civil court judges.  It s just to provide some belt and suspenders to make sure that, with judicial discretion, we don t trump Texas law, American law, with a foreign law regarding family law,  Campbell told reporters.Muslim groups have already criticized the bill, calling it a  solution looking for a problem.  They also argue that the bill will only perpetuate Islamophobia. What do you think? Do you support the measure?

"Feb 11, 2017","University trustees, known as the Yale Corporation, voted in favor of the renaming on Friday, reversing a decision last year to keep the name. Keeping the name had been defended as a way to confront rather than paper over the legacy of slavery.The change will go into effect in time for the 2017-2018 academic year. John C. Calhoun s legacy as a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a  positive good  fundamentally conflicts with Yale s mission and values,  President Peter Salovey said in a message sent to the Yale community on Saturday. He said depictions in the college celebrating plantations and the Old South suggest that Calhoun was honored in part because of his support for slavery, not in spite of it.Yale is among a number of colleges that have grappled with how to honor their histories without offending modern sensibilities. Vanderbilt University last year said it would pay $1.2 million to remove the word  Confederate  from a residence hall s facade, while Princeton University said it would keep Woodrow Wilson s name on its school of public and international affairs and a residential college, while increasing discussion of the former president s support of segregation. WSJIf Yale is so concerned about promoting diversity and working to erase any signs of slavery, why not rename the Calhoun College with their most famous black alumni, US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas? The tradition at Yale has been to name colleges after prominent, deceased, alumni, and ones that have contributed somehow to the human race. Morse College, for instance, is named after Samuel Morse, of the eponymous Morse Code.Yale will feel immense pressure to rename Calhoun for a minority figure, but who? Of Yale s deceased minority alumni, no one leaps to mind. Someone suggested Levi Jackson, which I thought was a nice idea, but Jackson isn t well known outside Yale circles, and I doubt any of today s students have any idea who he is.It seems likely Yale might jettison the  being dead  requirement. If that turns out to be the case, how about Clarence Thomas? He is easily Yale s most prominent black alum, even if he wasn t an undergrad.I am joking of course. While I would be proud if this came about, the left would sooner burn Calhoun to the ground than let it be named for a black conservative, only going to show that this isn t about race, it s about power and politics.One other thought: Elihu Yale was apparently a slave trader, among other things.

"Feb 12, 2016","Our next President is going to have to work with Congress to undo all of the excessive tax burdens, government regulations and restrictions, that have been forcing American businesses to go overseas in order to make a profit and compete Is Donald Trump that President? Video footage has emerged documenting the outrage and desperation of 1,400 American workers as they are informed that their company will be sending their jobs to Mexico.As Mediaite reports:  A cell phone video taken at Carrier Air Conditioner in Indianapolis shows the exact moment that the plant and union workers were told that the company had decided to shift production south of the border.  The best way to stay competitive and protect the business for longterm is to move production from our facility in Indianapolis to Monterrey, Mexico,  says the company representative at the microphone. Let s quiet down,  the company representative says as the American workers of different races and ethnicities begin to shout out after being told that they will soon be out of a job.Although the establishment media seems loath to report it, globalist trade deals and the off-shoring of American jobs have become a central focus of the 2016 race  as earlier this month President Obama s signed what could arguably be one of the impactful trade agreements in modern history, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The Economic Policy Institute has documented that  Between 1993 (before NAFTA took effect) and 2013, the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17.0 billion to $177.2 billion, displacing more than 850,000 U.S. jobs. More than 5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost between 1997 and 2014, and most of those job losses were due to growing trade deficits with countries that have negotiated trade and investment deals with the United States,  the report states.Mexico is a member country of the TPP. The Economic Policy Institute notes,  the United States already has a large and growing trade deficit with the 11 other countries in the proposed TPP, which reached $265.1 billion in 2014. In contrast, the United States had a small trade surplus with Mexico in 1993, before NAFTA took effect. In other words, outsourcing to the TPP countries is a potentially much greater threat than it was under NAFTA with Mexico. Donald Trump has made his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership a focal point of his campaign.Trump said that if he were President,I would call up the head of Ford  I would say,  Congratulations. That s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we re going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction,  and that s it  If it s not me in the position, it s one of these politicians that we re running against  [then] here s what s going to happen. They re not so stupid. They know it s not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say,  You can t do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can t do that to Ford.  And guess what? No problem. They re going to build in Mexico. They re going to take away thousands of jobs. It s very bad for us. So under President Trump, here s what would happen: the head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news  And he ll say,  Please, please, please.  He ll beg for a little while, and I ll say,  No interest.  Then he ll call all sorts of political people, and I ll say,  Sorry, fellas. No interest,  because I don t need anybody s money  I don t need anybody s money.I m using my own money. I m not using the lobbyists. I m not using donors. I don t care.

"Feb 12, 2017","Brigitte Gabriel is a Christian who, after being terrorized by Muslim extremists in her homeland of Lebanon, fled to the US with her family. Gabriel, the president and founder of ACT for America, travels around the nation delivering a message to everyday Americans about the radical infiltration of Muslim extremists in America. She explains in easy to understand terms how the Muslim Brotherhood has one goal: to sabotage America from within, and to make Islam the dominant religion of the country.Watch Brigitte Gabriel explain the Muslim Brotherhood s plan for the destruction of the United States: The most important page of this document is the last page. Because in the last past, they list 29 Islamic organizations set up  in the United States with the specific goal of sabotaging America from within, and destroying America by our own hands. The MSA is listed as one of the Islam organizations whose goal it is to destroy America. The MSA, or Muslim Student Association has more chapters on American  college campuses than the Republican and Democrat Party combined. Watch here:The tolerance for the funding of terror groups by Americans is about to come to end under President Donald J. Trump. One of the first actions he may take is to designate what many experts have been calling a terror group for years. The Trump administration could soon declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, a move that would greatly restrict the controversial group s global reach and would come despite its insistence that it has peaceful intentions.Trump himself was often critical of President Obama s outreach to the Muslim Brotherhood, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed a bill to call for declaring the Brotherhood a terror organization. In the past, it has been accused of supporting terrorist groups around the world, and several countries, including Muslim nations, have banned them.If the U.S. declares the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, it would make it a criminal act for Americans to fund the group, ban banks from processing money for it, bar people with ties to the group from coming to the United States and make it easier to deport immigrants who have worked with the organization. It is time to call this enemy by its name and speak with clarity and moral authority,  Cruz said in a statement introducing the bill. Watch Brigitte Gabriel destroy this Imam on Judge Jeanine s FOX News show: FOX NewsThe Left doesn t think Trump should designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and here s why:The New York Times editorial board thinks President Trump shouldn t designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization because it could make Trump the enemy of all Muslims.The liberal paper published Thursday an editorial Thursday titled  All of Islam Isn t the Enemy  arguing against the move, which the Trump administration is reportedly considering as a possible option. CIA Director Mike Pompeo has said he supports designating the group, which is open about its goal of creating a state ruled by Islamic law, as a terrorist organization. Is President Trump trying to make enemies of the entire Muslim world? That could well happen if he follows up his primitive ban on refugees and visa holders from seven Muslim nations with an order designating the Muslim Brotherhood   perhaps the most influential Islamist group in the Middle East   as a terrorist organization,  the editors charged.

"Feb 13, 2017","Anila Ali was born in Karachi, Pakistan, and studied in London, where she became a volunteer in the All Pakistan Women s Association. In 1996, she came to California. She is an active member of the Council of Pakistan-American Affairs (COPAA), the author of  Mommy am I a ?  and a contributor to the largest Pakistani paper in the U.S., The Pakistan Link.Ali is the founder and board member of the American Muslim Women s Empowerment Council, which is the only Muslim women s organization that works on the ground with law enforcement and interfaith leaders to counter radicalization and build capacity in the Muslim community do they can be the first line of defense against radicalization.She graciously agreed to speak with Clarion Project Dialogue Coordinator Elliot Friedland about being a Muslim-American since the election. The views expressed herein are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of Clarion Project. Ryan Mauro previously interviewed Anila Ali for Clarion Project.1. Clarion Project: Since Trump s election many Muslim groups are feeling scared that he will implement repressive policies targeted at the Muslim community. How do you feel about such fears?Anila Ali: There is a real fear in the community that a Trump presidency will mean restrictions on Muslims. There is talk of internment camps and it was in registry and that is generating a lot of misconceptions and fears. There is also a concern that Mosques and citizens will be monitored as well.Personally, I have faith in the constitution of the United States of America and I feel majority of America knows and understands that you cannot make generalized statements about all Muslims and paint all Muslims with the same brush stroke.But we have also realize that it is time that Muslims in America step up their game and get more involved in making sure that the neighbors understand who they are and that they are peace-loving patriotic Americans.For it is mostly the fear of the unknown that spreads misconceptions.2. Clarion: What should public figures be doing to calm inter-communal relations?Ali: Public figures, especially the ones in the majority party, have a responsibility to represent all Americans. Their words can help alleviate fears about Muslims and stop the Muslims from getting marginalized. Show of support unity with all unities that maybe feeling slightly marginalized, will help them from further isolation.The level of hateful rhetoric that I have heard in the past one month has been the worst since 911. It seems people have a newfound courage to tell  Muslims to leave the country,   pack up and leave the country  etc. Anti-Muslim sentiment is rampant and most people are not able to distinguish between a radical and a moderate.There is a general perception that all Muslims condone violence and that all Muslims want sharia law in America. There is also a very toxic perception that Muslims like myself who are any patriotic, modern and progressive are lying as mandated in the Quran to convert people, the concept being taqqiya. This notion must be dispelled because the majority of Muslims don t even know what this concept is. Muslims who have come from South Asia have no idea of this Arabic concept because it is part of the Wahhabi Salafist ideology and Muslims like me, majority coming from South Asia, have never even heard of it.These misconceptions in the mainstream community must be countered and dispelled.3. Clarion: What do you think the impact of designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization would be if it passed?Ali: If Arab countries can ban Muslim brotherhood why can t we? Any organization that has terrorist ties should be banned in the US. Any organization that condone the killing of an innocent, or promote so insights hatred for non-Muslims should be banned.4. Clarion: What organizations or activists would you recommend as standing up for the rights of the community and are unaffiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood or related organizations?Ali: Of course I would promote my own organization American Muslim women s empowerment Council, formed to counter extremism which gives women a voice, promotes the real Islam, gives women equality and completely condemns all shapes and forms of terrorism and hatred.Whoever wants to follow sharia law should migrate to a Muslim country like Saudi Arabia.For entire interview, go to the Clarion Project",MUSLIM DEMOCRAT WOMAN Is Asked How She Feels About Trump’s Presidency: “If Arab countries can ban Muslim Brotherhood why can’t we?”
"Feb 14, 2016","There is no other President in the history of the United States who has mastered the art of going around Congress to achieve his radical goals, better than Barack Hussein Obama. In normal times, this scenario would not be of concern to every day Americans. We are not however, living in  normal times.  We are living in time where our President has actually stated that his goal is to fundamentally transform the United States of America Pray for our nation.The Senate is currently in recess until February 22. The recess began on Friday. Whether this opens an opportunity for a recess appointment depends upon how Senate leaders interpret an adjournment resolution approved last Friday. That will determine whether it will meet for brief activity during the recess, which could close that opportunity.Here s the scenario in which President Obama may be able to appoint a temporary Supreme Court Justice: The Constitution not only assigns to the president the task of making nominations to the Supreme Court, setting off Senate review that may or may not result in approval, but it also gives the Chief Executive the opportunity to fill a vacancy on the Court temporarily, bypassing the Senate initially, if a nominee languishes in the Senate without final action.Within a few hours after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, it became abundantly clear that, first, President Obama will choose a possible successor and try to get the Senate to go along, and, second, the GOP leadership of the Senate say they will try to block any such nominee from final approval.If that does result in an impasse, President Obama may ponder the possibility of putting on the Court a new Justice of his choosing, to serve temporarily. The problem, though, is that less than two years ago, the Supreme Court severely narrowed the flexibility of such temporary appointment power, and strengthened the Senate s capacity to frustrate such a presidential maneuver.It is true that one of the Justices regarded as a giant on the Court s history, William J. Brennan, Jr., actually began his lengthy career with just such a short-term appointment. The chances of that happening again today seem to have diminished markedly.The presidential authority at issue in this possible scenario exists, according to Article II, when the Senate has gone into recess and the vacancy a president seeks to fill remains. Such an appointment requires no action at all by the Senate, but the appointee can only serve until the end of the following Senate session. The president (if still in office) can then try again during a new Senate session, by making a new nomination, and that must be reviewed by the Senate.The Supreme Court had never clarified that power until its decision in June 2014 in National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning.The decision was something of a compromise. The Court expanded the concept of when the Senate would be in recess so that the president could make a temporary appointment, but it also gave the Senate more control over when it does recess and how long the recesses last. The gesture toward the Senate s choices was probably the more important result.Here, specifically, is what the Court decided:First, on the president s side, the Court ruled that the recess appointment power applies when the Senate leaves town for a break in the middle of an annual sitting, or a break at the end of each annual session.Second, also on the president s side, the decision declared that the president during a recess can fill a vacancy even if the opening occurred well before the recess began.Third, on the Senate s side, the ruling made clear that it has to last more than three days, without saying how much more time must pass without the Senate out of town and doing nothing.Fourth, strongly on the Senate s side, the decision left it largely up to the Senate to decide when it does take a recess, allowing it to avoid the formality of a recess by taking some legislative action, however minor or inconsequential and however few senators actually take part in some action.Suppose President Obama goes ahead with a nomination to the open seat on the Court, and suppose that the Republican-controlled Senate chooses not to allow that nominee. The GOP has enough seats in the Senate to control that scenario.Suppose, then, that the Senate goes into recess to allow its members who are running for reelection to spend some more time campaigning back home.Could President Obama make a nominee during that recess? Only if the Senate is taking a recess lasting longer than three days, and does not come in from time to time during that recess to take some minimal legislative action. Both of those circumstances would be entirely within the Senate s authority.In that circumstance, a recess appointment to the Court would not be within the terms of the Constitution, as spelled out in Article II.Read more: scotusblog",HOW OBAMA Could Temporarily Fill The Vacancy Left By Justice Scalia With A RADICAL LEFTIST Judge

"Feb 15, 2016","Here s the brutal truth on the socialist who wanted to be your next president and take your hard earned money:Sanders spent most of his life as an angry radical and agitator who never accomplished much of anything. And yet now he thinks he deserves the power to run your life and your finances    We will raise taxes;  he confirmed Monday,  yes, we will. One of his first jobs was registering people for food stamps, and it was all downhill from there.Sanders took his first bride to live in a maple sugar shack with a dirt floor, and she soon left him. Penniless, he went on unemployment. Then he had a child out of wedlock. Desperate, he tried carpentry but could barely sink a nail.  He was a shi**y carpenter,  a friend told Politico Magazine.  His carpentry was not going to support him, and didn t. Then he tried his hand freelancing for leftist rags, writing about  masturbation and rape  and other crudities for $50 a story. He drove around in a rusted-out, Bondo-covered VW bug with no working windshield wipers. Friends said he was  always poor  and his  electricity was turned off a lot.  They described him as a slob who kept a messy apartment   and this is what his friends had to say about him.The only thing he was good at was talking   non-stop   about socialism and how the rich were ripping everybody off.  The whole quality of life in America is based on greed,  the bitter layabout said.  I believe in the redistribution of wealth in this nation. So he tried politics, starting his own socialist party. Four times he ran for Vermont public office, and four times he lost   badly. He never attracted more than single-digit support   even in the People s Republic of Vermont. In his 1971 bid for U.S. Senate, the local press said the 30-year-old  Sanders describes himself as a carpenter who has worked with  disturbed children.    In other words, a real winner.He finally wormed his way into the Senate in 2006, where he still ranks as one of the poorest members of Congress. Save for a municipal pension, Sanders lists no assets in his name. All the assets provided in his financial disclosure form are his second wife s. He does, however, have as much as $65,000 in credit-card debt.Sure, Sanders may not be a hypocrite, but this is nothing to brag about. His worthless background contrasts sharply with the successful careers of other  outsiders  in the race for the White House, including a billionaire developer, a world-renowned neurosurgeon and a Fortune 500 CEO.The choice in this election is shaping up to be a very clear one. It will likely boil down to a battle between those who create and produce wealth, and those who take it and redistribute it.Via: IBD",THE BRUTAL TRUTH About The Mooching Bum Who Wanted To Be Your Next President…And Tax You To Death

I could not, with any integrity, participate in such a sham that would only serve to legitimize the false narrative that the government is working to end police brutality and the institutional racism that fuels it,  wrote Aislinn Pulley, a leader of Black Lives Matter Chicago who the White House said on Wednesday would be at the meeting.Other attendees included Deshaunya Ware, a student leader of the University of Missouri protest group Concerned Student 1950; Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network; NAACP President Cornell Brooks; and National Urban League leader Marc Morial.In an op-ed on Truthout, Pulley said she  respectfully declined  the White House s invitation to attend the panel, which was organized as part of the administration s marking of Black History Month. I was under the impression that a meeting was being organized to facilitate a genuine exchange on the matters facing millions of Black and Brown people in the United States. Instead, what was arranged was basically a photo opportunity and a 90-second sound bite for the president,  Pulley wrote.Obama didn t address the absence when he spoke to reporters after the meeting, instead saying he was  encouraged by the degree of focus and seriousness and constructiveness that exists not only with existing civil rights organizations but with this new generation. They are some serious young people. I told them they are much better organizers than I was when I was their age. I am confident they will take America to new heights,  he said.Later Thursday, a senior administration official said Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and members of the Obama administration had a  productive dialogue with civil rights leaders about a range of important issues like the criminal justice system, education, the economy and building trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We will continue to engage with the many organizations and individuals who chose to participate in this meeting in ongoing discussions about how to strengthen our communities and move our country forward,  the official said.Speaking in the White House driveway after meeting with Obama, Sharpton said the group discussed the ongoing fight over naming a replacement for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. He said any GOP-led effort in the Senate to scuttle a presidential Supreme Court nominee would reflect a  civil rights violation. To act as if the President is anything less than the President of the United States until January 20, 2017. He cannot be minimized, marginalized or disregarded without doing the same to the American people,  Sharpton said.Obama has defended the groups that sprung from high-profile incidents of police killings of unarmed black men. He said in October those communities  grievances must be taken seriously, and pushed back on the notion that organizations like Black Lives Matter are anti-police. I think everybody understands all lives matter. I think the reason that the organizers used the phrase  Black Lives Matter  was not because they were suggesting nobody else s lives matter,  Obama said at an event in October. Rather, what they were suggesting was there is a specific problem that s happening in the African-American community that s not happening in other communities   and that is a legitimate issue that we ve got to address,  he said.

The first vote breakdown was like thisFIRST VOTE: 215 Sanders 210 Clinton 26 O Malley 8 Undecided 459 TOTALAnd this is the SECOND Vote: 232 Clinton 224 Sanders 456 TotalSo somehow they lost 3 people but Clinton s vote went up by 14.So basically what had happened was Hillary s team didn t take the time to do a full recount instead she just added the new people who joined the second vote. Which clearly wasn t an accurate count. Via: IJReview",WATCH WHAT SOME SAY Is Voter Fraud In Action During The Iowa Caucus [Video]

"Feb 20, 2017","The owner of a masonry business in Colorado is speaking out about his decision to fire more than 30 employees who did not show up for work in support of last week s  Day Without Immigrants  protest.Jim Serowski, the owner of JVS Masonry, told CNN in an interview on Sunday he did nothing wrong and said he warned his employees about the consequences of joining in the protest movement before they actually took the day off.Serowski said he told his employees,  If you re going to stand up for what you believe in you have to be willing to pay the price. On Saturday, Serowski also spoke to his local CBS News affiliate in Denver after one employee made an allegation that his termination felt like racism. Serowski denied the decision to terminate the workers was in any way racially motivated and said he made the decision because the employees violated the company s policy about not showing up to work. He said the decision put his company in a real bind because he had to shutdown two job sites on Thursday due to the protest and he is now risks missing an important construction deadline. They were told, if you no-call-no-show, you don t have a job,  Serowski told the news station.  It s that simple.

"Feb 26, 2016","How very progressive Not since the Civil Rights movement of the 60 s has America seen such a racial divide. Of course, we all know who s behind the manufactured race war in America. Barack Obama is working in unison with race agitators and Hollywood idiots like Harvey Weinstein who are willing to suffer the consequences of being humiliated by a racist comedian in front of millions, if it means they are absolved of the sins of not hiring enough black people.The co-chief of The Weinstein Co. acknowledges that the Academy has a poor track record when it comes to films about people of color   including his own   but he feels the blame belongs on studios and distributors, not on  people who ve worked so hard all their lives and prize that Academy card and have reached that zenith and then go on to retirement. I just can imagine Chris Rock s opening remarks,  Harvey Weinstein, the co-chief of The Weinstein Co., says as we sit down to record an episode of the  Awards Chatter  podcast days ahead of Sunday s Rock-hosted 88th Academy Awards.  If anybody s [planning on] boycotting the Oscars, don t, because Chris Rock is gonna annihilate every one of us [leaders of Hollywood studios/distribution companies] in the first 20 minutes of the show, and it will be well worth watching. It will be an Oscars to remember. This year, for the first time since 2008 and one of the few times in the last 25 years, none of Weinstein s films are nominated for best picture   Carol and The Hateful Eight came up short   but he s still going to the show, hoping for a best original score win for Hateful composer Ennio Morricone, among others associated with Weinstein Co. films, as well as a best actor win for  my buddy Leo [DiCaprio]  for The Revenant. That film, like the last two best picture Oscar winners 12 Years a Slave and Birdman, was guided to fruition by New Regency president/CEO Brad Weston, who used to be co-president of The Weinstein Co. s Dimension Films division.Here s an example of Chris Rock on one of his racist rants:Weinstein says he understands, from experience, the frustrations of the people calling for a boycott of the Oscars over the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, and feels they have made a difference   but he does not support their ultimate objective. It s that voice, actually, that gets people motivated,  he says,  because you don t want the boycott. That s how people use their personal power to force change. So I look at that and go,  Great,  because everybody s thinking about that now. I thought about it a couple of years ago because it had bugged me over the years that the films that I did about ethnic diversity never got anything. So I said,  I m gonna stack the deck for myself: I m gonna put out The Butler, Mandela and Fruitvale Station in the same year,  okay? We got one nomination   for U2   out of three movies.  Was race the driving consideration?  I have no idea,  he says,  but it has to make you think.  He continues,  And then, that year, there was 12 Years a Slave, and I said,  What is it, only one?'

I had a lengthy phone conversation with him last year and after I hung up the phone, I had the same kind of feeling I had after meeting Andrew Breitbart. Like Andrew Breitbart, Sabo s not fighting a conventional war against the left, he s studied them, he knows the dirty tactics they use to win and he s determined to beat them at their own game, even if it means shocking a few Americans along the way. Sabo never got to meet Andrew Breitbart, but always wanted to, as he recalls here:Now a thing about me was I d spent a good three years trying to get sober. In that time I did everything I could to stay the hell away from politics. It was the most peaceful three years of my life. Unfortunately during those three years guys like Glenn Beck and Andrew Breitbart were really picking up steam. So, because of my absence from the political scene I didn t really know much about them. And what little I did know about Glenn Beck I didn t really like. I remember friends would try turning me on to him but I wasn t into his delivery, too loud, too passionate. Not my deal. Sadly Andrew passed away about the time I decided to get back into the political fray. I never had the privilege to meet him. Everyone says we d of really gotten along. I did however get to meet his crew and they were all stand up people.Glenn Beck interviewed Sabo in 2015 when he was still keeping his face hidden from the public:  One of Sabo s most popular pieces of work was his badass representation of Ted Cruz who he wholeheartedly supported for President.During the campaign, Sabo came after Hillary and Bernie Sanders pretty hard. He focused on plastering his hard-hitting posters in areas where fundraisers or events for Bernie or Hillary were taking place. Sabo wanted to make sure the American public saw Hillary as he saw Hillary:It took him a while to come around to Donald Trump, but eventually he did.Sabo s controversial artwork can be found on posters, t-shirts and bumper stickers at his online store: unsavoryagents.com Here s a video of Sabo replacing a sign in a park bench in LA with his own unique printed message.

So vote for the wife of a rapist, who laughs about getting child rapists off with plea bargains. It s been 16 long years without a Clinton in the White House  let s make America Sleazy again!It s time to make history with the first female President because our first  Historic black President  worked out so well In a newly unearthed audio interview Hillary Clinton reveals how she managed to get a plea bargain for a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl   and shockingly laughs as she indicated she knew he may have been guilty.During the course of the conversation which dates from the early 1980s, Clinton, then 27, outlines how she used a mistake by the prosecution to get 41-year-old Thomas Alfred Taylor to walk free.Indeed, so cavalier is her attitude to securing the freedom of a man suspected of raping a child that the shocking and candid interview may tarnish her role as an advocate for women and children in the United States.The recordings which date from 1983-1987 were discovered by the Washington Free Beacon and are of Clinton recalling her role in the most important criminal case of her career.Who knew Killary had such a strong southern accent?This is not the first time that the trial has been written about.In 2008 at the height of her primary battle with Barack Obama, a Newsday story focused on Clinton s deeply controversial strategy of attacking the credibility of the girl. Rodham, records show, questioned the sixth grader s honesty and claimed she had made false accusations in the past. She implied that the girl often fantasized and sought out  older men  like Taylor, according to a July 1975 affidavit signed  Hillary D. Rodham   in compact cursive,  wrote Newsday.The girl was a family friend and Clinton has acknowledged in her past 2003 memoir, Living History, the difficulties the case provided her having just moved to Fayetteville. to run the University of Arkansas  new legal aid clinic. This guy was accused of raping a 12-year-old. Course he claimed that he didn t, and all this stuff,  says Clinton.However, what is most shocking is the breezy manner in which she discusses her clients crime and the offhand way in which she questions his innocence. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed   which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,  she says with a laugh.Indeed, Clinton laughs during several different parts of the interview   especially when she discusses the forensic lab destroying key evidence   which led to Taylor getting away with the crime.But, Ronald Rotunda, a professor of legal ethics at Chapman University, told the Washington Free Beacon.  We don t have to believe the client is innocent our job is to represent the client in the best way we can within the bounds of the law. However, he did raise the possibility that Clinton may have breached the attorney-client privilege by discussing the case so openly. You can t do that,  he said.  Unless the client says:  You re free to tell people that you really think I m a scumbag, and the only reason I got a lighter sentence is because you re a really clever lawyer.

He said another organization would be set up to promote the Muslim-friendly presidential candidate.Awad urged all Muslims to register to vote and to use Islamic centers as polling stations.

"Feb 3, 2017","***UPDATE to story below***In a blow to every mainstream media news outlet (and likely hurting a lot of feelings), President Donald Trump s ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries will take effect in Boston on Sunday after a federal judge refused to extend a temporary ruling blocking its enforcement.As Bloomberg reports, the decision by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton on Friday dealt a setback to rights advocates who argued that blocking people from seven nations in the Middle East was unconstitutional. Gorton was weighing whether to extend a seven-day order blocking parts of Trump s Executive Order.The case, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of several affected immigrants, is one of several that followed Trump s Jan 27 order, which roiled global travel by barring entry to the U.S. of citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Individuals, organizations, politicians and some states called it unconstitutional religious discrimination against Muslims.As GMA News Onine reports, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton on Friday asked Matthew Segal, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) representing the plaintiffs in the Boston case. If your honor s question is,  Does the word  Muslim  make a profound presence in this executive order?,  my answer is that it doesn t,  But the president described what he was going to do as a Muslim ban and then he proceeded to carry it out. Am I to take the words of an executive at any point before or after election as a part of that executive order? Judge Gorton on Friday asked U.S. Justice Department lawyer Joshua Press how the seven countries had been selected.Press responded that the list had come from a law passed in 2015 and amended early last year requiring that citizens of the seven countries apply for visas to enter the United States,  out of concern about the refugees that were coming, mainly from Syria at that time and terrorist events that were occurring in Europe.  As we noted previously, only 12.5% of the world s Muslims live in the seven countries on Trump s immigration ban list Which left the judge to decide (as the full docket explains here), The language in Section 5 of the EO is neutral with respect to religion, The provisions of Section 5, however, could be invoked to give preferred refugee status to a Muslim individual in a country that is predominately Christian. Nothing in Section 5 compels a finding that Christians are preferred to any other group. The order provides a reasonably conceivable state of facts (which concerns national security and) that could provide a rational basis for the classification,  he wrote.  Accordingly, this Court declines to encroach upon the  delicate policy judgment  inherent in immigration decisions. ORDERFor the forgoing reasons, the Court declines to impose any injunctive relief and will not renew the temporary restraining order that was entered on January 29, 2017 (Docket No. 6). Full Order at Zero HedgeUPDATE:Two federal judges across the country from each other issued two separate and equally different decisions late Friday   one refusing to extend an injunction against President Donald Trump s U.S. travel suspension and one blocking its effect nationwide.First, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, in Boston, said in a preliminary 21-page ruling that he would not extend a seven-day restraining order that has prevented the travel restrictions from being implemented this week.A short time later on Friday, though, U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, in Seattle, upheld a challenge to Trump s order from the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota and issued another temporary national restraining order. The state has met its burden in demonstrating immediate and irreparable injury,  Robart saidThe Boston ruling was a key victory for the Trump administration on the matter, but the win didn t last very long. The subsequent Seattle decision, meanwhile, represented the most significant legal setback yet in the battle over the president s directive   as it blocks the order with a new injunction.

"Feb 4, 2016","Of course anyone on Obama s  Team Fundamental Transformation of America  is exempt from any of the  consequences the rest of America would have to face for the same unlawful actions To meet the Obama administration s goal of  implementing a robust diversity strategy  at the Department of Defense (DOD), the agency s director of diversity violated government rules by distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to controversial leftist groups. Adding insult to injury, a  consulting  firm gets nearly half a million dollars from the DOD to help distribute the money to groups even those that don t qualify that support the Pentagon s  diversity strategy and program objectives. Among the recipients is the notorious open borders group League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Minority Access Inc., a Maryland-based nonprofit committed to decreasing disparities and reducing incidences of environmental injustices, and the renowned National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Others include the Society of American Indian Government Employees and the Asian American Government Executive Network. In all, the Pentagon s Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity (ODME) gave these and other groups north of $300,000, according to a DOD Inspector General report released this month. These are considered  affinity  groups involved with networking or professional associations that are often race, ethnic background or gender based, according to the report.The high-ranking official who violated DOD and government rules by doling out the cash to unqualified  non-federal entities  (NFE) is Clarence Johnson, the DOD s Director of Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity. In 2010 Johnson, a veteran Pentagon official, was assigned to assist the Army in implementing a robust diversity strategy. The position came with a hefty budget to support diversity outreach functions and Johnson launched a cash giveaway, filling the coffers of groups that should not have received public funds. In its report the DOD watchdog concludes that Johnson  improperly co-sponsored NFEs that he had selected.  Auditors found that Johnson spent $301,000 on NFE sponsorships and recommend  corrective action.  The money flowed through a company called New Concepts Management Solutions (NCMS) that was evidently handpicked by Johnson. In 2012, the Office of Diversity Management hired a consulting firm called Deloitte for $480,554 to handle the diversity outreach allocations.Here s a brief breakdown of how some of the money was divided. The Thurgood Marshall College Fund Leadership Institute Conference got $25,000, the Society of American Indian Government Employees got $12,000 for a training conference and a conglomerate called Latina Style Outreach received $20,000. LULAC and the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Awards Corporation (HENAAC) received $25,000 each. It appears that Johnson knew well that he was violating agency rules when he headed the diversity crusade because the report reveals that the DOD Office of Special Counsel has consistently said that the agency should not  sponsor  non-federal entities like the ones Johnson gave money to. In addition to money, Johnson provided these various groups with logistical manpower compliments of Uncle Sam.It s unlikely that Johnson will face any repercussions for his transgressions or, at most, a weak slap on the hand. He certainly appears confident in testimony to investigators probing his violations.  My job is to grow, or focus on growing, the presence of minorities and women  in government jobs with higher pay scales, Johnson told investigators. He added that the mission of his office is diversity outreach, which involves informing the diverse audience. This is why he seeks affinity groups that have a  national reach  and influence.President Obama has made it his mission to culturally transform government by teaching federal workers about diversity, race and gender, healthcare disparities and cultural competencies. The effort has affected practically every major agency, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS), among others. It s been a costly initiative for taxpayers. A few months ago a Judicial Watch investigation found that the Obama administration has paid a Chicago-based firm millions of dollars to strengthen the federal workplace with its brand of diversity consulting. This includes two recent DHS contracts for $24,000 and $10,000 and one for $8,500 from the Department of Energy (DOE).

"Feb 4, 2017","President Donald Trump s Senior Counselor Kellyanne Conway clarified a comment in which she mistakenly referred to a  Bowling Green Massacre. She said Friday on Twitter that she meant to say  terrorists  instead of  massacre,  referencing a 2013 ABC News story on two suspected terrorists living as refugees in Kentucky.According to the story:  The discovery in 2009 of two al Qaeda-Iraq terrorists living as refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky   who later admitted in court that they d attacked U.S. soldiers in Iraq   prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones, known as IEDs, for other suspected terrorists  fingerprints. An undercover FBI operation exposes Al Qaeda terrorists posing as refugees in the middle of the American heartland. They quickly learned the laxed background checks were to blame. But it turns out that may be just the beginning. There may be dozens more now in this country as well.The video below shows an admitted Al Qaeda terrorist who had already killed American soldiers in Iraq, trying to get weapons to kill more of them. And Authorities tell ABC News he may be just one of dozens of men with American blood on their hands where mistakenly allowed to settle in the US as refugees.The two men came from Iraq 4 years ago among tens of thousands of refugees who the State Department approved to come here, seen as  no threat to the US . But the two were in fact, as the FBI says part of an Al Qaeda connected insurgent group that had already killed American soldiers with road side bombs.

Launched by NOAA with a public relations fanfare, it was splashed across the world s media, and cited repeatedly by politicians and policy makers.But the whistleblower, Dr John Bates, a top NOAA scientist with an impeccable reputation, has shown The Mail on Sunday irrefutable evidence that the paper was based on misleading,  unverified  data.It was never subjected to NOAA s rigorous internal evaluation process   which Dr Bates devised.His vehement objections to the publication of the faulty data were overridden by his NOAA superiors in what he describes as a  blatant attempt to intensify the impact  of what became known as the Pausebuster paper.His disclosures are likely to stiffen President Trump s determination to enact his pledges to reverse his predecessor s  green  policies, and to withdraw from the Paris deal   so triggering an intense political row.

"February 1, 2016 ","EXETER, N.H./MILFORD, N.H. (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, emerging from the first presidential nominating contest in Iowa as the leading Republican mainstream contender, portrayed himself in New Hampshire on Tuesday as the party’s best hope to recapture the White House. But Rubio, 44, a U.S. senator from Florida, faces a strong field of establishment rivals in next week’s New Hampshire primary after his stronger-than-expected third-place finish in Iowa behind front-runners Ted Cruz, 45, and Donald Trump, 69. “If I am the nominee, we are going to beat Hillary Clinton and it won’t be by the flip of a coin,” Rubio told supporters in Exeter, New Hampshire, taking a jab at the close Democratic race in Iowa between Clinton and challenger Bernie Sanders, where some precincts were decided on a coin flip. Other more mainstream Republicans including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Ohio Governor John Kasich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, are expected to do better in New Hampshire than in Iowa and vie with Rubio to become the establishment favorite. Cruz and Trump also headed to New Hampshire as the presidential race shifted to the second nominating contest in the state-by-state battle to pick nominees for the Nov. 8 election to replace Democratic President Barack Obama. Trump told a news conference before a rally in Milford, New Hampshire, that he felt “a tinge” of disappointment at losing to Cruz in Iowa.. The billionaire businessman also picked up an endorsement from former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. Cruz told New Hampshire supporters he was like former Republican President Ronald Reagan, urging the state to help ensure his nomination by giving him a win in the Feb. 9 primary.  “Every day from now until Election Day here in New Hampshire, I’m going to continue asking for the men and women of New Hampshire to make that same fateful decision yet again so that we can reignite the promise of America,” Cruz said. Cruz, a conservative U.S. senator from Texas, beat Trump in Iowa’s Republican caucuses with the help of the state’s large bloc of evangelical Christians, but he might struggle to finish on top in New Hampshire, where Republican voters have a more secular and libertarian streak. Cruz apologized to rival Ben Carson over an email his campaign sent on Monday night implying Carson was dropping out of the race and his Iowa backers should switch to Cruz. “This was a mistake from our end, and for that I apologize to Dr. Carson,” Cruz wrote.  The campaign for Carson, who finished fourth in Iowa, said the retired neurosurgeon had accepted Cruz’s apology but that the incident was the sort of “dirty trick” politics that Carson was trying to fight. The Democratic presidential contenders, Clinton and Sanders, also headed to New Hampshire after their close duel in Iowa, where the former secretary of state narrowly edged out the insurgent U.S. senator from Vermont. Vermont borders New Hampshire, and that proximity may give Sanders an advantage in next Tuesday’s primary. Clinton’s razor-thin margin was the smallest in Iowa Democratic caucus history. Concerns about the income gap and economic insecurity have helped Sanders, 74, a self-described democratic socialist who came from far behind in polls to throw a scare into the front-runner in Iowa. Clinton, 68, acknowledged she had to try harder to win younger Democrats, who backed Sanders in Iowa in large numbers. “I’m going to have some work to do to reach out to young voters, maybe first-time voters, who have to make a tough decision,” she told CNN. The two Democrats also renewed a days-old battle over when and where to have more face-to-face debates, and were still talking about potentially meeting in a televised debate on Thursday night in New Hampshire. On the Republican side, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who dropped out of the race in December, said a recent hardening of Rubio’s position on immigration and the strength of his anti-abortion stance might cost him.      “Running to the right to win Iowa is going to be a hard sell here in New Hampshire,” Graham, a supporter of Bush, told Reuters in Rindge, New Hampshire. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio said he was the candidate to unite the Republicans in the November election, when the party hopes to regain the White House after Obama’s two four-year terms. “People realized on the Republican side that we cannot afford - this country cannot afford - to lose this election, and that I give the party the best chance not just to unify our party but to grow it,” Rubio told ABC’s “Good Morning America” from Manchester, New Hampshire.   The fluent Spanish speaker hopes to win back some of the Latino vote the party lost in recent years as it toughened its stance on immigration. A foreign policy hawk, Rubio advocates a tough approach to Iran, the Islamic State militant group and other U.S. foes. Iowans who supported Rubio at the caucuses said they responded to his relatively positive message and viewed him as the candidate most likely to beat Clinton should she be the Democratic nominee.    Worries about issues such as immigration and terrorism have fueled the campaigns of Trump and Cruz. Christie on Tuesday accused Cruz and Rubio of lacking executive experience for the job of president. “What do they do exactly in the United States Senate? They talk and they talk. They are not responsible for doing anything,” Christie said at his campaign’s New Hampshire headquarters in Bedford.  Opinion polls of Republicans show Trump leading nationally and in New Hampshire. But the state has a long tradition of bucking trends in presidential primaries. Trump, the outspoken real estate magnate who dominated the Republican race for months, broke an unusual silence of more than 12 hours on Twitter after his defeat in Iowa. “Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor,” he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday where he has regularly posted scathing criticism of his opponents.

"February 10, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House promised on Wednesday that it would be able to uphold U.S. commitments to an international climate change agreement, as a court ruling heightened concerns about the stability of the global carbon reduction pact reached last year. Shares of coal companies reflected the uncertainty the day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. After jumping nearly 7 percent early in the session, the Thomson Reuters U.S. coal index was down 3 percent in afternoon trading.  The court dealt a serious blow to the Obama administration’s climate change agenda on Tuesday when it took the unusual step to delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan until legal challenges to the regulation are completed. A centerpiece of the Obama administration’s climate change policy, the Clean Power Plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels.  The decision to temporarily block the rule came after the United States entered into a landmark agreement in December with countries around the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the Clean Power Plan was expected to be the main tool for the United States to fulfill its part of the pact, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters in a briefing that it was only one part of the nation’s response to climate change. The long-term extension of the tax credits for renewable energy last year will continue to provide momentum that will transition the power sector toward cleaner sources of energy, Schultz said. “The inclusion of those tax credits is going to have more impact over the short term than the Clean Power Plan,” he said. But French government spokesman Stephane Le Foll quoted outgoing Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius as saying after a cabinet meeting that the decision was “not good news,” even if the debate will continue in the United States.  Claudia Salerno, a Venezuelan diplomat who leads the country’s delegation at U.N. climate talks, described the ruling as “truly damaging” to the outcome of the pact in a Twitter message late on Tuesday.

"February 11, 2016 ","MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed sharply in a debate on Thursday over their support for President Barack Obama, with Sanders accusing Clinton of “a low blow” after she compared him to Republicans. As the Democratic race moves to states with large minority populations, both candidates openly courted black and Hispanic votes during a debate that was far more restrained and cordial than last week’s contentious debate in New Hampshire. In the sharpest exchange of the night, Clinton attacked Sanders for being too critical of Obama, who is extremely popular with the black voters who will play a big role in the outcome in South Carolina and other upcoming nominating contests. “The kind of criticism that we’ve heard from Senator Sanders about our president, I expect from Republicans, I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama,” said Clinton, who served as secretary of state during Obama’s first term. “Madam Secretary, that is a low blow,” said Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont. Sanders said he had been an Obama ally in the Senate even if he did not always agree with him. “Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?” Sanders said. Clinton, who has eagerly embraced Obama’s legacy, said Sanders had called Obama weak and a disappointment, and “that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.” With Clinton looking to rebound after her crushing 22-point loss to Sanders in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, the two also differed over healthcare and Wall Street.  Even so, the restrained exchange on Thursday was unlikely to change the trajectory of a race that has intensified dramatically over two weeks. Clinton accused Sanders of misleading Americans on his healthcare. She said his proposal for a single-payer, Medicare-for-all healthcare plan would mean dismantling the program known as Obamacare and triggering another intense political struggle. “Based on every analysis I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don’t add up,” Clinton told Sanders. “That’s a promise that cannot be kept.” Sanders said he was simply moving to provide what most industrialized countries have - healthcare coverage for all. “We’re not going to dismantle anything,” Sanders said. “In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.” Sanders also repeated his accusation that Clinton is too beholden to the Wall Street interests she once represented as a U.S. senator from New York, noting her Super PAC received $15 million in donations from Wall Street. “Let’s not insult the intelligence of the American people,” he said. “Why in God’s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it, they want to throw money around.” Clinton said the donations did not mean she was in Wall Street’s pocket, and noted that President Barack Obama had taken donations from Wall Street during his campaigns. “When it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street,” she said. With an eye to on the minority vote, both candidates decried the high incarceration rate of African-Americans and called for broad reforms of the criminal justice system. Sanders said the disproportionately high rate of incarceration for black men was “one of the great tragedies” in the United States. He called for “fundamental police reform” that would “make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will in fact be dealt with.” Clinton criticized what she called “systemic racism” in education, housing and employment. “When we talk about criminal justice reform … we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing and other ways of helping communities of color,” she said. They both agreed on the need for immigration reform, an important issue to Hispanic voters, though they clashed over the Obama administration’s actions on handling a wave of undocumented children who entered the country alone. Clinton criticized Sanders for voting against a reform measure in 2007, which Sanders defended because of a provision in the bill for guest workers. Clinton entered Thursday’s debate under acute pressure to calm growing nervousness among her supporters after her drubbing in New Hampshire and a razor-thin win the prior week in the Iowa caucus. Both states have nearly all-white populations. For his part, Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, hoped to harness the momentum and enthusiasm he gained from the first two contests and prove he can be a viable contender to lead the Democratic Party to victory in the Nov. 8 presidential election. “What our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics,” Sanders said. “They want a political revolution.” Clinton dodged an opportunity to distance herself from former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s recent controversial comments that there was “a special place in hell” for women who don’t support other women. “Look, I think that she’s been saying that for as long as I’ve known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesn’t change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make,” she said. On the foreign policy front, Sanders criticized Clinton for her warm relationship for Henry Kissinger, who served as secretary of state under Republican President Richard Nixon during the Vietnam War. Sanders called Kissinger “one of the most destructive secretaries of state.” Asked by Clinton about who his foreign policy advisers were, Sanders shot back: “Well it ain’t Henry Kissinger.” The race now moves to what should be more favorable ground for Clinton in Nevada and South Carolina, states with more black and Hispanic voters, who, polls show, have been more supportive of Clinton so far.

"February 12, 2016 ","SEVNICA, Slovenia (Reuters) - If Melania Trump succeeds Michelle Obama as First Lady, she may trace her road to the White House back to 1987 and a chance encounter in the capital of her native Slovenia. “I was leaving a fashion show in Ljubljana and saw her in front of the building. She was probably waiting for a friend,” said Slovenian photographer Stane Jerko. “She was tall and slim so she caught my eye and I approached her and suggested that she come in for a trial photo shoot.” Jerko says the resulting black-and-white pictures of the 17-year-old known then as Melanija Knavs – round face, bare feet, hair in a ponytail – launched a career that would take her to Milan and the United States, where she met Donald Trump at a party in New York in 1998. Though not quite a tale of rags to riches, the lifestyle she leads as the third wife of the billionaire businessman is a far cry from her roots in Slovenia, a tiny former Yugoslav republic of 2 million people comparable in size to New Jersey and nestled below the Julian Alps between Italy, Croatia, Austria and Hungary.  Residents of the small town of Sevnica in southeastern Slovenia, where Melania grew up on the banks of the River Sava, say her father sold car parts and that her mother worked for a factory that made children’s clothing. She was often seen sewing late into the evening at home. Some media reports have said her father was a member of the then ruling Communist Party, like many other people in socialist Yugoslavia, but Reuters could not independently confirm this. The Trump campaign team offered Reuters a different account of her childhood and career, saying Melania began modelling at the age of five, that her mother was a fashion designer and her father a manager in a car company. “Her father was never a member of the Communist Party,” a spokesperson said.  Since taking a gilded escalator with her husband at his Fifth Avenue Trump Tower skyscraper in June last year when he announced his decision to run for president, Melania has adopted a low profile in his campaign for the Republican Party nomination. She does not appear at his rallies, where Trump occasionally brings out his children instead, though he rarely fails to mention her.  “When I saw whom she married I noticed a number of similarities between Donald Trump and Melanija’s father,” said Mirjana Jelancic, who said she was a childhood friend of Melania. “They have similar features and behaviour and are both hard workers. I think she met a soul mate in him, someone she can feel safe with.” The Knavs family lived in an apartment block, moving when Melania was a teenager to a modest two-storey house above the Sava on the outskirts of Sevnica, where a well-maintained medieval castle sits on a hill overlooking the town of some 4,500 people. Melania’s parents still live in the house, which has a small garden and a few fruit trees, though they spent a lot of time in the United States, where Melania’s sister Ines also lives. The house was empty when Reuters reporters visited and repeated phone calls went unanswered. Jelancic recalled Melania as a model student keen on the arts, geography and history. “She loved reading. She always carried books with her,” said Jelancic. “I also remember she had wall bars at home and trained regularly to keep her body in shape.” “Melanija liked beautiful clothes and knew how to wear them,” said Jelancic, now headmistress at Melania’s former elementary school.  “She liked to give them a personal touch by redesigning them and was very good at upgrading old things. It was clear she would work in fashion though she never said that she wanted to be a model.” “I remember her telling me how she cannot wait to go to Ljubljana where she attended a high school for design. She had a wish to see the world.” It was in Ljubljana that she was discovered and began modelling full-time, coming second place in a 1992 national beauty pageant the year after Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia and fought a ten-day war to strike out alone.  “She was shy at first but learnt quickly and showed great interest in every detail of the shoot,” said Jerko. “She was like a sleeping chrysalis that transformed into a glamorous butterfly,” he gushed. The future Mrs Trump did not look back, changing her name to the more easily pronounceable Melania Knauss. No one in Sevnica spoken to by Reuters recalled having seen her there in recent years. She did, however, donate an ambulance to the local health clinic to celebrate the birth of her son, Barron, in 2006, a year after marrying Trump, 24 years her senior.  Some speculated that the town might receive another donation or more publicity if Trump wins the presidency. Those Reuters spoke to would not be drawn on his politics, which are stridently anti-immigration.  Jerko, a youthful 78 years-old with short grey hair and beard, still keeps a file with Melania’s pictures and measurements. “I’m sure she would be happy if her husband became U.S. president. I think she is very proud of his achievements and I believe I had something to do with where she is today.” ","From a river town in Slovenia to Trump Tower, and the White House?"
"February 13, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump, his face red with emotion, lashed out at rivals Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz on Saturday at the most acrimonious debate to date between Republican presidential candidates, shouting insults and casting aside a pledge to be more measured. The New York billionaire went into the CBS debate with a head of steam, having won New Hampshire last Tuesday and holding a big lead in polls in South Carolina a week before Republicans vote on Feb. 20. Rather than play it safe, Trump responded to every comment leveled his way, interrupted his opponents at will and called them liars repeatedly in an emotional outburst that could raise more questions about whether he has the temperament to serve in the White House.  He made his most blistering attacks against Bush and his brother, former President George W. Bush, who has many admirers in the Republican establishment. It was hard to declare a winner in the debate amid the constant volley of insults, not all of them from Trump. Cruz and fellow Senator Marco Rubio also took pointed jabs at each other over illegal immigration. But Trump dominated the debate conservation on Twitter with 40 percent of the mentions, according to data from the micro-blogging platform. Trump’s combative style has set the tone for much of the campaign but in recent days he had pledged to pursue a more measured, positive approach. At the debate, that strategy lasted only through his comments about Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who was found dead on Saturday. Trump was quickly goaded when Bush criticized Trump’s past statements that Russia has a role to play in Syria. Russia, Bush said, is not attacking Islamic State militants but instead helping Syrian President Bashir Assad, who Washington wants to leave power. Trump blasted Bush’s brother for launching the Iraq war in 2003 over claims, later proven false, that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. “A big, fat mistake,” said Trump, noting that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks had also occurred on Bush’s watch. “George Bush made a mistake,” Trump thundered. “We all make mistakes. But that one was a beauty ... They lied! They said there were weapons of mass destruction. And there were none.” Many in the crowd booed Trump and the Republican front-runner dismissed them as “lobbyists and special interests” supporting the former Florida governor. Bush, who has wilted in the past under assault from Trump, stood firm this time. He will campaign with his brother George on Monday in North Charleston, South Carolina. “I’m sick and tired of him going after my family,” Bush said. “My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind. While Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And I’m proud of what he did. “He had the gall to go after my mother,” Bush said, reminding the audience that Trump had criticized his 90-year-old mother, Barbara Bush, wife of former President George H.W. Bush. “My mother is the strongest woman I know.” “She should be running,” Trump responded. Bush provoked another outburst from Trump by saying the Republican nominee should be someone “who doesn’t brag, for example, that he has been bankrupt four times.” “That’s another lie,” Trump said. “I never went bankrupt.” Trump also was drawn into a fight with Cruz over whether the real estate developer is sufficiently conservative. Trump called himself a “common-sense conservative,” which Cruz dismissed. “If Donald Trump is president he will appoint liberals to the Supreme Court,” Cruz said. “You are the biggest liar,” Trump said sharply. As they tried to talk over each other, Cruz chided Trump by saying, “Donald, adults do not interrupt each other.” Ohio Governor John Kasich, who finished second in the New Hampshire primary last Tuesday and who pushes an optimistic message, called for calm. “These attacks, some of them are personal. I think we’re fixing to lose the election to (Democratic front-runner) Hillary Clinton,” he said. Cruz and Rubio renewed their battle over who is the toughest on illegal immigration with Cruz insisting that the Florida senator, as part of a Gang of Eight senators who sought a compromise on legislation in 2013, was for “amnesty” but now is against it for political purposes. He insisted that Rubio had said in Spanish on Univision that he would not rescind an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in support of the children of illegal immigrants. Rubio shot back: “I don’t know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn’t speaking Spanish.” As the crowd roared, Rubio said Cruz is “telling lies... He’s lying about all sorts of things and now he makes things up.” Before the clashes broke out, the Republican candidates urged Obama not to nominate a successor to Scalia, saying it should be up to the next president to decide.

"February 14, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates hardened their  positions on Sunday on blocking a move by President Barack Obama to fill the Supreme Court seat left by the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, a lifetime appointment that would help decide some of the most divisive issues facing Americans.  The next justice could tilt the balance of the nation’s highest court, which was left with four conservatives and four liberals. The vacancy quickly became an issue in the 2016 presidential race. “We ought to make the 2016 election a referendum on the Supreme Court,” U.S. Senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” The normally nine-justice court is set to decide this year its first major abortion case in nearly a decade, as well as cases on voting rights, affirmative action and immigration. Scalia, 79, died on Saturday at a West Texas resort. The cause of death will not be determined for several days, the top official in the county where he died, Presidio County Judge Cinderela Gueara, said on Sunday in an interview with local TV station WFAA-TV. Obama, a Democrat, will nominate someone to fill the empty seat but will wait until the U.S. Senate is back in session, the White House said on Sunday. The Senate returns from recess on Feb. 22. “At that point, we expect the Senate to consider that nominee, consistent with their responsibilities laid out in the United States Constitution,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. The White House declined to give a more specific timeline for Obama to announce his nominee. The nomination will set up a battle with the Republican-controlled chamber, which must approve any nominee. Shortly after news of Scalia’s death, Republicans vowed not to act on the vacancy until Obama’s successor takes office next January. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said failure to act would be a “shameful abdication” of the Senate’s constitutional duty. Both sides said history was on their side.  Reid said it would be unprecedented to have a vacancy on the court for a year. In the modern era, the longest Supreme Court vacancy was 363 days after Abe Fortas resigned in May 1969.  Republicans cited 80 years of tradition in which no Supreme Court nominees were approved in presidential election years. In fact, Justice Anthony Kennedy was approved in 1988, after a bruising battle in which the Senate rejected President Ronald Reagan’s first nominee, conservative Robert Bork. Supreme Court nominations are rare, so neither side has much data to rely on in determining precedents. History is also an unreliable guide as the nomination process has become significantly more politicized in recent years. For Obama’s previous two Supreme Court picks, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, he took about 30 days each to announce the elections after their predecessors, Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice David Souter, respectively, said they planned to step down. Ohio Governor John Kasich, a moderate among the Republicans vying for the White House, said the Senate should wait because a battle this year would only deepen divisions in the country. “You know how polarized everything is,” Kasich said on ABC’s “This Week.” “What I don’t want to see is more fighting and more recrimination.” Democratic U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy warned that a delay could have consequences in November’s election, when voters get to decide who fills one-third of the Senate’s seats. “If the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing, I think that is going to guarantee they lose control of the Senate, because I don’t think the American people will stand for that,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”    Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said the Constitution was clear. “The president makes the appointment, Senate confirms, let’s get on with that business,” the senator from Vermont said on “Fox News Sunday.” One possible contender to replace Scalia is an Indian-American appeals court judge, Sri Srinivasan, who has pro-business credentials and a stellar resume. His nomination could make it more politically challenging for Republicans to block anyone put forward by Obama. Cruz, a Texas lawmaker, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee that takes the lead on Supreme Court nominees, said the vacancy left by Scalia made the presidential election even more critical. He warned that a justice chosen by Sanders or his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, would mean the Second Amendment right to bear arms would be “written out” of the Constitution and abortion on demand would become the law of the land.  Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another White House candidate, said he would want someone who echoed Scalia’s “originalist” ideology that looks at the U.S. Constitution through the lens of its framers’ 18th-century intentions. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, appearing on NBC, was more direct when asked what he would want: “Someone just like Justice Scalia.” That would mean someone who did not let ideological differences preclude civility or even friendship, former President Bill Clinton told CNN, citing Scalia’s bond with liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ginsburg, in a statement on Sunday, called her friend “a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit” with whom she disagreed “now and then.” She cited a duet sung by the two justices in the 2015 opera “Scalia/Ginsburg” titled: “We are different, we are one.” She and Scalia, Ginsburg wrote, were “different in our interpretation of written texts, one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve.”  (Additional reporting by Joan Biskupic, Alana Wise, Timothy Gardner in Washington; Sara Vasquez in Marfa, Texas; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

"February 15, 2016 "," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Supreme Court nomination battle that was ignited on Saturday with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia has given Democrats an explosive new issue that could bolster their chances of regaining majority control of the U.S. Senate.  The impact could be felt most acutely in “swing” states, where Republicans are trying to hold onto Senate seats, political strategists and analysts said. The high stakes are also expected to prompt greater voter turnout that could favor Democrats.ALSO ON REUTERS Trump is a ------: White House hopeful plays fill-in-the-blanks with voters Not in my backyard? Mainstream Scandinavia warily eyes record immigration With no clear idea of who President Barack Obama will nominate as Scalia’s replacement, it was way too early to know exactly how this fight will play out in already rollicking presidential and congressional elections.  But, “in this hyper-polarized political environment we are currently operating in, I can only assume the battle over this (court) nominee will dominate the political debate from here on out,” said Jim Manley, a strategist and former top aide to Democratic senators.  Manley noted Republicans are facing tough races for Senate seats in swing states such as Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and could find themselves in even tighter spots because of the divisive fight over Scalia’s replacement.  These Republican candidates, who either already serve in the Senate or are vying for open seats, have to especially thread the needle in their politically divided states on social issues, like abortion rights, that so dominate Supreme Court confirmation fights.  Democrats already enjoyed an advantage in the November Senate elections, having to defend only 10 seats while 24 Republican seats are up for grabs in the 100-member chamber.  Democrats need a net gain of five seats to win back the majority they lost in the 2014 elections.  Just hours after Scalia’s death at the age of 79, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proclaimed that whoever moves into the White House on Jan. 20, 2017 - and not Obama - should pick the replacement for the late conservative jurist.  The Senate must confirm presidential nominees to the life-time appointments at the nine-justice high court, whose recent decisions have had a deep impact on the country, from the legalization of same-sex marriage to election campaign finance.  “If the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing, I think that is going to guarantee they lose control of the Senate, because I don’t think the American people will stand for that,” proclaimed Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who was interviewed on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.    Meanwhile, McConnell’s announcement sparked new fundraising pleas in the presidential and congressional campaigns, which already were awash in campaign contributions.  Ron Bonjean, a former top Republican Senate leadership aide and current political strategist, acknowledged that Republican Senate candidates from swing states “may be placed in an awkward position” by the Supreme Court fight.  While some may be pressured to join Democrats in calling for a confirmation vote depending on who Obama nominates, Bonjean also saw a potential upside for those Republicans.  With anti-establishment candidates like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders far exceeding expectations in their quest for the presidency, Republican Senate candidates in swing states could feel emboldened to break from party ranks.  Senator Mark Kirk in Illinois, for example, is one of those Republicans in a swing state facing a potentially rough race.  The 2016 campaigns already were generating an avalanche of voter interest with control of the White House and Congress hanging in the balance.  Now, with the ideological control of the Supreme Court also to be decided, “That leads to only one conclusion: Increased turnout” of voters in November, said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.  Higher turnout often helps Democratic presidential candidates, which in turn could help Democratic Senate candidates.  However, Sabato also noted that with the Supreme Court vacancy ascending in importance, it could rally establishment Republicans who currently oppose the anti-establishment Trump to support him if he becomes the party’s nominee.  And that, in turn, could boost Republican turnout in tight Senate races.  ",Supreme Court fight gives Democrats fuel to regain U.S. Senate control

"February 17, 2016 ","CHARLESTON, S.C./SUMTER, S.C. (Reuters) - The Republican race for the party’s 2016 presidential nomination erupted into a four-candidate crossfire on Wednesday over who has the proper experience and is the most conservative, days before South Carolina voters put their stamp on the campaign. In TV interviews and campaign events, front-runner Donald Trump threatened to sue Senator Ted Cruz of Texas over a negative TV ad, while Senator Marco Rubio of Florida accused Cruz of lying about his record, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush questioned Rubio’s experience to serve as president. Amid the squabbling, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley endorsed Rubio as the Republicans’ best hope for winning the White House, a boost to Rubio and a blow to Bush, who had lobbied hard for her to pick him. The endorsement gave Rubio, 44, a valuable ally to try to sway voters ahead of Saturday’s South Carolina Republican primary, the third contest after Iowa and New Hampshire to pick a party nominee for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Bush had a tough day, learning of Haley’s endorsement right before a town hall meeting in Summerville, South Carolina, where four members of the audience second-guessed his campaign strategy and offered tips on how to have a greater impact in the state. Much of the debate took place over the television airwaves, as Trump, 69, a billionaire businessman and former reality TV star, lobbed charges at his rivals at an MSNBC town hall, and Rubio and Cruz battled in back-to-back appearances at a CNN town hall in Greenville, South Carolina. Trump fumed about a TV ad put out by the Cruz campaign that brought up Trump’s past position in support of a woman’s right to an abortion. Trump says he has evolved into a conservative and is now against abortion. “You look at a guy like Ted Cruz, he’s a nasty guy,” Trump said. “He doesn’t have one Republican endorsement from the Senate and he works with the Senate. Think of it. Hard to believe.” Cruz dared Trump to sue him over the campaign ad, which featured a 1999 video clip of Trump saying he was “very pro-choice” on abortion. Cruz said Trump sent his campaign a “cease and desist letter” demanding it drop the ad. At the CNN town hall, he said he laughed out loud when he got the letter threatening what he called a “frivolous lawsuit.” “In any defamation case, truth is a complete defense,” Cruz said. Questioners at the town hall pressed Cruz, 45, on charges leveled against him by Trump that he may not be eligible to be president because he was born in Canada, and that none of his U.S. Senate colleagues liked him. Cruz said he met the constitutional requirement that a president must be a “natural born citizen” because his mother was an American. As for his Senate colleagues, Cruz said some may not like him because he serves the interests of his constituents, not fellow senators. The latest national Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Trump taking a more than 20-point lead over Cruz in the Republican race. Trump had 40 percent support in the poll conducted from Saturday to Wednesday, compared with 17 percent for Cruz, 11 percent for Rubio, 10 percent for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and 8 percent for Bush. The results contrasted with those of an NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll that put Cruz ahead of Trump among Republicans by 28 percent to 26 percent. Rubio, hoping to overtake Cruz for second place in South Carolina, where Trump leads in the polls, accused Cruz of spreading falsehoods with an ad attacking Rubio over his position on immigration. Rubio backed a 2013 Senate immigration reform effort that collapsed. Cruz says Rubio would have supported “amnesty” for illegal immigrants, which his rival denies. “If you say something that isn’t true and you say it over and over and you know it’s not true, it must be a lie,” Rubio said. Bush, running fourth in South Carolina and behind Rubio, questioned Rubio’s level of experience after Rubio said Bush did not have foreign policy experience. Rubio counts his time on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as valuable experience. “It’s hard for me to be lectured to by a gifted young guy who thinks going to committee hearings means you know something about the world,” Bush said in Summerville. At the event, Bush, 63, the son and brother of former presidents, sounded a note of frustration at frequent criticism of his campaign by TV pundits. “The pundits have made it all – it’s all decided. We don’t have to go vote, I guess. It’s all finished. I should stop campaigning, maybe, huh? It’s all done,” he said. “No,” shouted people in the crowd.

"February 19, 2016 ","CHICAGO (Reuters) - An Illinois judge on Friday said she would decide next month whether she had jurisdiction over a voter’s complaint that Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz should not be on the state’s primary ballot because he was born in Canada. Lawrence Joyce, a lawyer and pharmacist, filed a complaint in January with the Illinois State Board of Elections saying that under the U.S. Constitution, the Texas senator cannot run for president since he is not a “natural born” citizen. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta of a Cuban father and an American mother. The Board rejected Joyce’s complaint - saying Cruz became a natural-born citizen at the moment of his birth because of his mother’s citizenship - so he petitioned the Cook County Circuit Court to review that decision. Circuit Court Judge Maureen Ward Kirby said she was not sure she had jurisdiction, and set a March 1 hearing for arguments on whether to dismiss the complaint. The complaint comes in the wake of repeated attacks on Cruz about his eligibility by New York businessman and presidential rival Donald Trump. Children born abroad to American citizens can immediately be registered as U.S. citizens through a consular report of birth abroad, but Joyce said that process is a form of naturalization. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in January found that one quarter of Republicans did not think Cruz was qualified to be president because of his birthplace.  Cruz and Trump are locked in a battle to win the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Cruz won the first nominating contest in Iowa while Trump prevailed in New Hampshire. “A potential nightmare scenario may be developing if Ted Cruz becomes the nominee and is then forced to resign the nomination,” Joyce told reporters. He backs Republican candidate Ben Carson but said no candidate was involved in his lawsuit. Voters in New York and in Alabama have also filed legal challenges to Cruz’s eligibility. “It is widely assumed and believed that no court is going to invalidate a presidential candidate on this issue,” said Gerald Rosenberg, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. Lawyers for both Cruz and the Illinois State Board of Elections said they would present motions to dismiss the case based on jurisdiction and because they said Lawrence did not properly serve notice of his complaint. The Illinois primary is March 15 but early voting has already begun. ",Illinois judge to decide jurisdiction over Cruz eligibility complaint
"February 2, 2016 ","NEW YORK (Reuters) - It may be too close to call between Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, but the senator from Vermont was the clear winner on social media.  Sanders maintained his strong social media presence during the caucuses, commanding the majority of the Twitter mentions over Clinton. Sanders was mentioned over 77,000 times on Twitter during the caucus, while Clinton was mentioned 52,000 times, according to social media sentiment analytics firm Brandwatch.  Clinton, the Democratic front-runner and former secretary of state, was in a virtual tie with Sanders with more than 93 percent of Iowa precincts reporting. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, amassed the largest number of new Facebook followers of any candidate in the race during Monday, the social network said, topping Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump by 15,695 to 10,704. Clinton had the third most new followers, with 6,210 liking her page in the past day. Among Republicans, Trump finished second in the caucuses to Ted Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas. Sanders resonated with Millennial social media users as well. Social media platform Yik Yak, which is particularly popular among younger social media users, said Sanders was mentioned in 60 percent of all yaks that discussed a Democratic candidate during the caucuses. While social media buzz does not necessarily translate into votes, it is a good indication of the interest level surrounding a candidate. The Iowa contest was the first of the state-by-state battles to pick nominees for the Nov. 8 election to succeed President Barack Obama. Google trends data also showed strong interest in Sanders. In Iowa, Sanders was the top-searched-for Democratic candidate on the search engine, with 52 percent of queries relating to the Democratic candidates. Clinton commanded 42 percent of queries. Even so, Trump was the top most-searched for presidential candidate overall, according to the most recent Google search data available.

"February 20, 2016 ","LAS VEGAS/COLUMBIA, S.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump rolled to victory on Saturday in South Carolina in a contest that saw former Florida Governor Jeb Bush drop out, while Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton beat back a strong challenge from Bernie Sanders in Nevada. The victories by Trump, who is running as an anti-establishment outsider, and Clinton, a preeminent political insider, solidified their positions as the front-runners to win their parties’ respective nominations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. The night’s most prominent casualty, Bush suffered a distant fourth place finish in the Republican contest and announced he had suspended his campaign, ending his dream of becoming a third Bush president after his father and brother. “The people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken, and I really respect their decision,” an emotional Bush said in Columbia. He finished far out of the running in each of the first three states. By winning both South Carolina and New Hampshire and holding leads in 13 states that hold Republican contests on March 1, Trump was arguably on track to win the nomination, an outcome that seemed astounding to contemplate when he entered the race last summer. “It’s going to be very difficult for him to be derailed at this point,” said Hogan Gidley, who was a senior adviser to former Republican candidate Mike Huckabee.    The 69-year-old real estate billionaire and reality TV star was declared the winner in South Carolina about an hour after polls closed, and launched into a feisty victory speech.  “Let’s put this thing away,” Trump told cheering supporters in Spartanburg. He denounced TV pundits for saying there could be enough anti-Trump votes to beat him when the race thins further. “These geniuses,” he said. “They don’t understand that as people drop out, I’m going to get a lot of those votes also. You don’t just add them together.” Trump easily defeated Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who were in a close fight for second place and the right to declare themselves the anti-Trump alternative. With 99 percent of South Carolina precincts reporting, Trump had 32.5 percent, followed by Rubio with 22.5 percent and Cruz with 22.3 percent.  Cruz’s inability to distinguish himself from Rubio in the state was a blow to his campaign, which had invested heavily there to rally support among South Carolina’s large population of evangelical voters. Trump’s victory won him at least 44 of the state’s 50 delegates, bringing his delegate count to 61, compared to 11 for Cruz and 10 for Rubio, according to a tally by Real Clear Politics. Republicans need 1,237 delegates to win the party nomination. It was Trump’s second victory in a row, an outcome that frightens establishment Republicans but thrills the “throw-the-bums-out” conservative base of the party that has long been fed up with Washington.         The bellicose New York billionaire had created some last-minute drama in South Carolina after Pope Francis said on Thursday his views on U.S. immigration were “not Christian.” Trump, who has also advocated a ban on Muslim immigrants to counter domestic terror threats, stirred fresh controversy on Friday when he told a crowd about a U.S. general who was said to have dipped bullets in pigs’ blood to kill Muslim prisoners a century ago. Former Secretary of State Clinton’s victory in the Nevada Democratic caucuses, meanwhile, could help calm worries among the Democratic establishment about the strength of her campaign. Her result denied Sanders the breakthrough win he had sought in a state with a heavy minority population, but his ability to close a one-time double-digit polling lead for Clinton suggests the Democratic nominating race will be long and hard fought. With 90 percent of precincts reporting, the former first lady was leading with 52.6 percent of the vote to Sanders’ 47.4 percent.  Clinton’s victory gave her fresh momentum as she heads into the next contest in South Carolina on Feb. 27, where polls show her with a double-digit lead largely as a result of heavy support from black voters. “Some may have doubted us, but we never doubted each other,” she told cheering supporters at a victory rally in Las Vegas. “This is your campaign.”     Sanders vowed to fight on and set his sights on the 11 states that vote on “Super Tuesday,” March 1. He predicted that when Democrats gather for their nominating convention in Philadelphia in July, “We are going to see the results of one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States.” “The wind is at our backs,” the Vermont senator said. “We have the momentum.” After routing Clinton in New Hampshire and finishing a strong second in Iowa, states with nearly all-white populations, Sanders had hoped to prove in Nevada that he could win over black and Hispanic voters and compete nationally as the race moves to states with more diverse populations. But entrance polling in Nevada showed he badly lost among black voters, by 76 percent to 22 percent, a bad omen for South Carolina and other southern states with big black populations.

"February 21, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has for months rained withering ridicule on onetime party favorite Jeb Bush, on Sunday refused to take responsibility for the former Florida governor’s exit from the 2016 White House race. “I just don’t know what did him in,” Trump, who won South Carolina’s Republican primary election handily on Saturday, said in an interview on CNN. Trump had repeatedly made Bush the target of pointed attacks throughout his campaign for the Republican nomination to run in the Nov. 8 general election, labeling him “weak,” “low-energy” and “an embarrassment” to the Bush political dynasty. On Sunday, Trump denied any role he may have played in taking down Bush, who ended his campaign on Saturday night after a fourth-place finish in South Carolina. “Jeb fought very hard,” the billionaire businessman said. “It wasn’t his time. That’s all.” Bush, the brother of one president and the son of another, had prided himself as the only candidate to attack Trump head-on throughout the campaign and frequently accused him of lacking ideas. He appeared to take one last jab at Trump in his concession speech on Saturday, saying: “Despite what you may have heard, ideas matter. Policy matters.” Sounding less like his normally combative self, Trump on Sunday credited Bush in a pair of interviews with having fought hard in the campaign and called him “very capable.” “Those last couple of weeks he was on television so much, I was looking,  I’d say, ‘Man, I’ve never seen anything like this,’” Trump said on CNN. He did, however, chide Bush for having run “brutal” negative ads against him, saying he was “a little bit offended.” “So, you know, this is a tough business, I will tell you,” the billionaire real-estate mogul said of presidential politics. “I think real estate in Manhattan is a lot easier.”  (Reporting by Megan Cassella; Editing by Jonathan Oatis) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"February 22, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Mark Kirk, facing a tough re-election fight in Illinois, said on Monday the Senate should vote on whomever President Barack Obama nominates to the U.S. Supreme Court, breaking with his party’s leadership. In another defection among Republicans, Senator Susan Collins of Maine called for hearings on the eventual nominee.  A political fight has erupted over filling the court’s vacancy left by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, with many top Republicans threatening to block any nominee put forth by the Democratic president. Obama’s nominee could shift the court to the left for the first time in decades. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the seat should remain vacant until Obama’s successor takes office in January so voters can have a say on the selection when they cast ballots in the November presidential election. Kirk wrote in a Chicago Sun-Times opinion piece that he recognized the right of any president to choose a Supreme Court nominee and he looked forward to Obama picking one for the Senate to consider for confirmation. “I also recognize my duty as a senator to either vote in support or opposition to that nominee following a fair and thorough hearing along with a complete and transparent release of all requested information,” Kirk added. Kirk, who holds Obama’s old Senate seat, said he hoped the president would pick a nominee “who can bridge differences, a nominee who finds common ground and a nominee who does not speak or act in the extreme.” Kirk’s stance illustrates that McConnell may have trouble keeping Senate Republicans fully united over filling Scalia’s seat. Some senators like Kirk are seeking re-election this year in states where Democrats are competitive. Collins, who is not facing re-election until 2020, said on Monday the Senate had an obligation to hold public hearings on Obama’s nominee. “The kind of thorough process that a hearing allows is the best way to evaluate a nominee,” Collins told reporters, according to the Hill newspaper. But it appeared unlikely that enough Republicans would peel away from McConnell to allow a vote on the Senate floor.     Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah said on Monday it was up to McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to decide whether to hold confirmation hearings. “I feel like we ought to put it off and get it out of this harsh atmosphere,” Hatch told reporters.

"February 23, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. Senate on Tuesday ruled out taking  action on any nominee put forth by President Barack Obama to the Supreme Court in a political power move intended to thwart his ability to change the court’s ideological balance. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate will not hold hearings or vote on any nominee to replace long-serving conservative Justice Antonin Scalia until after the next president takes office next January. Scalia died on Feb. 13. McConnell, a Republican nemesis of Obama during the president’s seven years in office, said he even would refuse the standard courtesy of meeting with whomever Obama chooses. Under the U.S. Constitution, the Senate has the power to confirm or reject a president’s Supreme Court selection. With the U.S. presidential election looming on Nov. 8, Republicans were aiming to allow the next president to fill Scalia’s vacancy, hoping a Republican will be elected. “This nomination will be determined by whoever wins the presidency in the fall,” McConnell said, adding that the overwhelming view of Senate Republicans was that “this vacancy should not be filled by this lame-duck president.” Obama’s nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades. Scalia’s death left the court with four liberal and four conservatives. Not since the contentious nominations by Republican presidents of Robert Bork in 1987 and Clarence Thomas in 1991 has there been such an intense fight over a Supreme Court vacancy - and Obama has yet to announce his pick.  The White House and Senate Democrats condemned McConnell’s stance. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called it “obstruction on steroids,” adding: “Gone are the days of levelheadedness and compromise.” McConnell and other congressional Republicans have sought to block numerous Obama initiatives, including his signature healthcare law, the Iran nuclear deal, immigration policy and efforts to battle climate change. McConnell invoked a past statement by Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden, to help justify Supreme Court inaction. McConnell noted that Biden, as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman in 1992, argued for postponing action on Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Biden has since said he was speaking hypothetically because there was no Supreme Court vacancy at the time. McConnell made his announcement after Chairman Chuck Grassley and the other Republican members of the Judiciary Committee sent him a letter saying the panel would not hold confirmation hearings. Grassley had previously left open the possibility of convening hearings. Alluding to the Nov. 8 presidential election, Republican senators told McConnell in the letter they wanted “to ensure the American people are not deprived of the opportunity to engage in a full and robust debate over the type of jurist they wish to decide some of the most critical issues of our time.” If the Senate does not consider a nominee until after a new president takes office, it would be unlikely that the Supreme Court would have its full complement of nine justices any sooner than early 2017. That would mean the court would be shorthanded for more than a year, hampering its ability to decide cases. In cases that end in 4-4 rulings, lower-court decisions stand and no national precedent is set. Reid said the Republican strategy was driven by the Republican party’s right wing. “It’s what Donald Trump and Ted Cruz want,” Reid said, referring to two of the Republican presidential candidates. But Reid said Senate Democrats would not become “the obstruct caucus” and block legislation such as appropriations bills in retaliation for the Republican inaction. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said blocking a hearing for Obama’s nominee would be unprecedented and would “subject the Supreme Court to the kind of politics that they’ve been insulated from for more than two centuries.” “Since 1875, a president’s nominee has never been denied a hearing unless that president later withdrew that nomination,” Earnest said. In remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell said, “Presidents have a right to nominate, just as the Senate has its constitutional right to provide or withhold consent. In this case, the Senate will withhold it.” Chuck Schumer, a member of the Senate Democratic leadership, predicted that the Republican position would crumble as voters put pressure on vulnerable Republican Senate incumbents seeking re-election to consider Obama’s nominee. “It’s not just a risky strategy, it’s the wrong strategy and it’s going to fail,” Schumer said of the Senate Republicans. But Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican Judiciary Committee member, countered, “I’m not concerned about that (public pressure). We’re standing for a principle that the next president ought to resolve this problem.” Democrats are badly outnumbered in the 100-member Senate, falling far short of the 60 votes needed to advance controversial legislation much less a Supreme Court nomination. Counting the two independents who caucus with them, Democrats control 46 seats, with the remaining 54 held by Republicans. ",Senate Republicans rule out action on Obama high court pick

"February 25, 2016 ","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Presidential candidate Donald Trump admires the late Douglas MacArthur and George Patton, both World War Two generals. They were winners,  unpredictable, and not especially nice guys, he says in campaign speeches. But Trump’s pledge to imitate their styles sets modern-day military experts on edge.  Although unquestionably in the pantheon of U.S. military heroes, MacArthur and Patton were also controversial figures remembered by historians as flamboyant self-promoters. The commander in the Pacific, MacArthur was eventually fired by President Harry Truman for speaking out against Truman’s policies in the Korean War, which followed World War Two. Before Patton died in December 1945, he questioned the need to remove Nazis from key posts in postwar German politics and society. As Trump edges closer to the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election, he likely will face more pointed questions about the policy ideas behind his sweeping statements. His main Republican rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have offered far more details about their foreign policy visions as has Hillary Clinton, front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Born in 1946, a year after World War Two ended, Trump often praises MacArthur and Patton for the blunt ways he says they commanded respect. “George Patton was one of the roughest guys, he would talk rough to his men,” Trump told an audience last week in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. “His men would die for him,” Trump added. “We don’t have that anymore.” He said Patton would wipe out Islamic State without hesitation were he still in command.  But military historians and retired generals say Trump has an inflated view of the two military men and especially their relevance to an era of modern warfare when armies rely more on technology and when battle successes and failures and civilian casualties are communicated far more rapidly than when MacArthur and Patton commanded troops 70 years ago. The candidate’s spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump made a habit of citing the two World War Two figures to “emphasize the need to strengthen the U.S. military, talk less and do more to protect America.” She declined to comment on the criticisms. She said Trump had consulted military experts, but declined to say how many, who they were or whether they were retired or active. Trump was unavailable for an interview. Interviewed by Reuters, recently retired military personnel voiced doubts about Trump’s grasp of U.S. military operations. One retired four-star general called Trump’s references to Patton and MacArthur “bumper sticker foolishness.” Another said Trump was comparing “apples to oranges” by likening America’s role in World War Two to the fight against Islamic State.  “He has no understanding of how it works, at least in my view,” said an aide to a third retired four-star general. “He makes these bold statements and one-liners, but that doesn’t     translate into understanding what it takes to be a military leader, what it takes to develop a plan.” All three criticized as inflammatory Trump’s recounting, at a Feb. 19 rally in Charleston, South Carolina, of a myth about World War One General John Pershing ordering the execution of alleged Muslim insurgents in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig’s blood, an extra offense to Muslims because Islamic law prohibits the consumption of pork.  Trump often says that in the spirit of MacArthur and Patton, he never wants to reveal his specific plans for military operations, since that would give the enemy a chance to prepare and counterattack. “I don’t want my generals being interviewed,” he said in Myrtle Beach.  Trump’s statement had an irony about it, given his oft-repeated comment that he knows what military experts have to say from their interviews on television. But historians said the comment also showed he has little understanding of just how often MacArthur and Patton spoke to the press.  “They were the media whores of their time,” said Daniel Drezner, a professor at International politics at the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy at Tufts University who often writes on national security. He said anyone vaguely familiar with Patton by way of the 1970 George C. Scott film “Patton” would know he got into trouble for remarks that were politically controversial.

"February 26, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans in Washington are coming to grips with what many of them not long ago considered an unimaginable reality: Donald Trump is likely to be their presidential nominee and standard-bearer. The prospect of Trump winning the Republican primary had been the stuff of Washington jokes, whispered hallway conversations and eye-rolls, even as he led in public opinion polls for months and dominated debate after debate. But with the brash billionaire now winning three straight contests in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, denial is giving way to a mostly gloomy acceptance that he may have too much momentum to be stopped, especially if wins big in key Southern primaries next week that look favorable to him. “It fills all of us with concern and dread,” said Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has endorsed fellow Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, considered the main hope of the Republican establishment to derail Trump’s march to the nomination. That march was given a boost on Friday when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican presidential candidate who dropped out of the race after a dismal finish in New Hampshire, became the first major establishment Republican to endorse Trump. “There is no better fighter than Donald Trump,” Christie said at a news conference with Trump in Texas. Trump has vowed to scrap U.S. trade deals, slap a tariff on imported goods and raise taxes on hedge-fund managers, as well as retain some sort of mandate to purchase health insurance - clashing with the free-market principles that have long underpinned Republican economic policy.  Some Republicans in Congress, such as Flake and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said a Trump nomination would do enormous damage to the party and predicted a heavy election defeat in November to the eventual Democratic nominee. “I am like on the team that bought a ticket on the Titanic after we saw the movie,” said Graham, contending that Trump would be “slaughtered” in the general election.  In a Republican presidential debate in Houston on Thursday night, another Trump rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, challenged him on his electability, citing ties to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton such as a donation to the Clinton Foundation. Trump responded by ridiculing Cruz for his inability to win more than the early voting state of Iowa and taunted him for being behind the billionaire in opinion polls in Cruz’s home state of Texas. Said Trump, “If I can’t beat her, you’re really gonna get killed, aren’t you?” Another Rubio supporter, Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, told Reuters he would not back Trump if he were the nominee. “If the nominee is a fraud, and someone who’s offensive, and incapable of being an effective president like Donald Trump, I won’t support him,” Curbelo said.  Other Republicans tried to be more optimistic.  “I don’t think his nomination would be catastrophic,” said Senator Susan Collins of Maine. She said she did not believe, as some strategists fear, that having Trump on the ballot in November would hurt Republican chances for holding onto control of the Senate, where the party currently has a 54-46 edge. Conservative economist Arthur Laffer, an adviser to former President Ronald Reagan who has been counseling Trump on tax policy, said he was convinced the real estate mogul was open to sound advice. Laffer recalled Trump telling him: “‘Look, if you’ve got a better idea than I’ve got, tell me, and I’ll change.’” Senator John Thune of South Dakota suggested Trump’s presence could help by bringing more voters to the polls.  “There’s a lot of energy, a lot of intensity on our side,”  Thune said.  Privately, lobbyists, economists, and analysts expressed deep concern about having Trump, who has proposed building a wall along the southern U.S. border and imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, as the face of the party.  “There are a lot of people who are really freaked out,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was the chief economic policy advisor to 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain. “He seems to be winging it.”  Conservative policy-makers worry that Trump’s pitch to voters is based on his management skills rather than conservative principles.  Juleanna Glover, a prominent Republican communications consultant, told Reuters that Trump’s ascent “spells the death of the party’s sentient and cohesive governing framework.” Two Republican business lobbyists, who also asked to remain unidentified, told Reuters that they are very concerned about Trump, chiefly because they do not know what he stands for.  They said they have no sense of certainty because Trump’s positions on issues such as tax, trade, and regulation range from being only vaguely understood to completely unknown.  By vowing to make America “win” again abroad while going into little detail on his foreign policy plans, Trump is also stirring concern in Washington national security circles.  A high-ranking official at a conservative think-tank, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his job requires him to steer clear of partisan politics, said: “Every serious student of American strategy is sick to their stomach about the possibility of Trump being the Republican nominee.”  Robert Kagan, a conservative foreign relations expert at the Brookings Institution think tank, said in a column for the Washington Post on Thursday that he would vote for Clinton rather than Trump. “The party cannot be saved, but the country still can be,” he wrote. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and a leading voice on conservative economic policy, was asked Thursday whether he could work with someone like Trump if he became the nominee.  “We’ll cross these bridges when we get to it,” Ryan said. “But I do believe that we will be able to unify as a party.” Asked about the hand-wringing in the Republican establishment about Trump, his campaign manger, Corey Lewandowski, said, “Look, we’ve got relationships with those guys and we talk to them all the time.  “But I think what you find is that, you know, politics as usual in Washington, D.C., is not something that the American people want,” he said. Lewandowski added that voters “sent a very clear message” in the three early voting states where Trump won nominating contests “that they want someone who is going to make fundamental change.” Asked if Trump’s campaign would work harder to win establishment endorsements as he got closer to the nomination, Lewandowski pointed to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, an early establishment favorite who quit the race on Saturday. “If endorsements mattered,” he said, “Jeb Bush would be the nominee.”  (Reporting by Susan Cornwell, Richard Cowan, Kevin Drawbaugh, Jason Lange, Arshad Mohammed, David Morgan, James Oliphant,  Matt Spetalnick and Emily Stephenson; Writing by James Oliphant; Editing by Stuart Grudgings and Frances Kerry) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"February 27, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz  released tax returns for several years on Saturday in an effort to pressure billionaire front-runner Donald Trump to follow suit. Rubio, whose financial decisions earlier in his life have come under scrutiny, paid $78,917 in taxes on $335,561 in gross income in 2014, along with his wife, Jeanette. Cruz paid $389,124 in taxes on $1.2 million income in 2014 along with his wife, Heidi, who is employed by Goldman Sachs and currently on leave from the bank.  Rubio and Cruz, both first-term U.S. senators, trail Trump in national polls and are fighting to stop the political novice from locking up the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election after big wins in South Carolina and Nevada. The real estate developer has said he will not release his returns until a routine audit has been completed.  “If Donald is embarrassed about his tax returns, it’s up to the voters to assess the facts. It’s time to stop delaying and come clean with the American people,” Cruz said in a statement. Rubio released his last five years of federal returns on Saturday, while Cruz submitted four years. Rubio said Trump, who has promoted his success as a businessman as one of his key qualifications for the presidency, may not be as wealthy as he suggests. “I think part of it is he’s not as rich as he says he is,” Rubio said while campaigning in Georgia. Rubio and his wife have only one debt: the mortgage on their house, the campaign said, seeking to emphasize that the senator had moved past previous financial woes. Rubio often refers to the nearly $150,000 in student loan debt he incurred by the time he graduated from law school, paid off with proceeds made from his 2012 autobiography. He also faced questions for struggling for several months in 2008 to pay the mortgage on his $384,000 South Florida home, despite a $300,000 salary from his job at a Miami law firm. Rubio also drew scrutiny for liquidating a retirement account to cover expenses, such as home repairs and school fees. That was reflected in $68,241 of income as part of his 2014 return. During his 2010 bid for the U.S. Senate, which followed his stint as a Florida state lawmaker from 2005-2006, Rubio had to defend his use of a Republican Party-issued American Express credit card for more than $7,200 personal expenses, which he later paid back.  Trump has accused Rubio of living beyond his means. Rubio’s adjusted gross income in 2010 was $183,826 in 2010. It spiked to $929,439 in 2012, when his book “An American Son: A Memoir” was published. “There is no doubt the Rubio family has come a long way from the days when their largest monthly expense was a check to (student loan provider) Sallie Mae and checks were sent in the mail to pay bills with the hope the payment did not arrive before the next paycheck was deposited into their account,” Rubio’s campaign said. Cruz’s wealth, with $1.2 million in combined income with his wife in 2014, placed them well above the $423,000 threshold of the top 1 percent of earners in Texas, according to a 2015 Economic Policy Institute report.

"February 28, 2016 ","COLUMBIA, S.C. (Reuters) - Riding high after a landslide victory in Saturday’s South Carolina primary, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has set sights on a possible face-off in the Nov. 8 presidential election with Donald Trump, the favorite for the Republican nomination.  “Despite what you hear, we don’t need to make America great again. America has never stopped being great,” she told supporters in her victory speech in South Carolina, declining to mention Trump by name, but taking a jab at his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Clinton said she was not taking anything for granted after crushing Democratic rival Bernie Sanders on Saturday by 48 percentage  points, likely setting herself up for a good “Super Tuesday” night on March 1, a key date in the nomination battle. But if Clinton and Trump win big on Tuesday as opinion polls suggest, the chance of a general election matchup between them increases, adding another twist to a presidential campaign that has defied convention as U.S. voters vent frustration over economic uncertainty, illegal immigration and national security threats. Some Clinton backers, emboldened by the heightened chance of a Trump nomination, have reaffirmed their support for the former secretary of state, saying that it is she, not Sanders, who is best equipped to take down Trump in a head-to-head showdown in November. Rosilyne Scott, 58, of Texas, cast her vote early for Clinton ahead of Texas’s upcoming Tuesday nominating contest, calling the prospect of a Trump presidency “frightening.” “I just think she has more support, and she’s been doing it a lot longer,” she said.  “If you get someone like Donald Trump in, I don’t know. ... I think he’s a joke, a bigot, a racist.” Amid Clinton’s renewed momentum against Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, donors have also found resolve. One Clinton fundraiser in California said her recent victories in Nevada and South Carolina have prompted more people to donate to her campaign and to attend Clinton events. He said he had raised $10,000 for the Clinton campaign in the past week alone.  A Trump-Clinton election would embody the outsider-versus-establishment battle in American politics. Trump has never been elected to public office, while the former first lady has been a player in Washington for decades.   South Carolina was Clinton’s third victory in the first four Democratic contests, raising more questions about whether Sanders, a democratic socialist, will be able to expand his support beyond his base of predominantly white liberals. Exit polls showed Clinton winning big in the state with almost every constituency. She won nine of every 10 black voters, as well as women, men, urban, suburban, rural, very liberal and conservative voters. Sanders was ahead among voters between ages 18 and 29, and among white men. When asked which candidate they thought “can win in November,” an overwhelming 79 percent said Clinton, with only 21 percent putting their faith in Sanders to defeat the eventual Republican nominee. Sanders, who has energized the party’s liberal wing and successfully courted many of the party’s youth, on Sunday acknowledged he had been “decimated” by Clinton in South Carolina. He set his sights on March 1, where a win in a key state is crucial to keeping his hopes alive. “I think we’re going to do well on Super Tuesday, we’re going to do well in many states after that and we look forward to those state-by-state struggles,” he said in an interview on NBC News’s “Meet the Press.” But Sanders needs to have his breakout moment sooner rather than later, warned longtime Democratic activist Phil Noble, who said that Sanders’ momentum in South Carolina “fell off the table” after Clinton’s solid victory in Nevada on Feb. 20.      “He’s got to pull off a surprise against Clinton soon or he won’t have time to recover,” he said.

"February 29, 2016 ","WASHINGTON - A Donald Trump rally in Virginia was repeatedly disrupted on Monday by protesters, including some from the Black Lives Matter movement, in a stark display of the divisions the Republican front-runner’s presidential campaign has long been accused of sowing. A Time magazine photographer trying to document the exit of dozens of black protesters from the rally in southwestern Radford, Virginia, was grabbed by the neck and shoved to the ground by a U.S. Secret Service agent. Hecklers disrupted the rally on a day when the New York billionaire fended off criticism that he had not clearly condemned white supremacist support during an interview on CNN on Sunday. Trump taunted the protesters, shouting “Are you from Mexico?” at one of them. Supporters in the audience confronted the hecklers in angry, face-to-face exchanges. As black protesters were escorted from the rally, the crowd around them began to chant, “All lives matter.” Trump waited for the scene to quiet down before saying, “Folks, you’re going to hear it once: All lives matter.” The crowd roared with applause.   Black Lives Matter is a civil rights movement that sprang from police shootings of black Americans in recent years. The Trump rally took place on the eve of Super Tuesday, the biggest voting day in the race to pick the 2016 presidential nominees for the November election. A number of Southern states including Virginia are holding contests on Tuesday, and opinion polls show Trump is likely to consolidate his status as favorite to win the Republican nomination. It was unclear whether Trump would be damaged by support from white supremacists. He has risen in opinion polls and won three of four early nominating contests while proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, calling Mexican immigrants criminals and insulting women. His rivals for the Republican nomination, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, urged him to ask the New York Times to release a recording of his recent interview with its editorial board, following a report he told it he was not serious about his immigration proposals. On Monday, the protesters disrupted Trump’s remarks several times for long stretches, prompting him to shout to security guards several times, “Get them out please, get them out.”  Trump appeared to relish the discord, saying after the turmoil in the crowd that his rallies were more exciting than those of the other candidates: “But it is fun, and exciting.” At a rally last week in Nevada, Trump also jumped into the fray with a protester when he said, “I’d like to punch him in the face.” Time photographer Chris Morris was on the fringe of an enclosed media section when he was seized by an agent from the  Secret Service, which has the job of protecting the U.S. president and some White House candidates. “I stepped 18 inches out of the (press) pen and then he grabbed me by the neck and started choking me and then he slammed me to the ground,” Morris told CNN at the scene. The Trump campaign said it was not aware of the details of the incident and directed inquires to local law enforcement. Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback said the agency was aware of the incident involving one of its employees but it still working to “determine the exact circumstances that led up to this incident.” Earlier on Monday, Trump’s rivals criticized him for equivocating on white supremacist support when he was asked repeatedly on CNN if he would condemn the Klan and disavow support from white supremacists, including David Duke, a former Klan grand wizard from Louisiana. Trump said that he had been hampered by a faulty earpiece during the CNN interview. Duke on Monday denied that he had endorsed Trump. But he said he planned to vote for him and had advised his friends to do so too because of the candidate’s views on immigration and world peace. Duke told Fox News Radio he disapproved of Trump’s “lip service” in support of Israel, but “I told my people to vote for him in the election” for strategic reasons. He said he had not been part of the Ku Klux Klan for nearly 40 years.     On the Democratic side, front-runner Hillary Clinton alluded to the country’s divisions on Monday after a landslide victory on Saturday in South Carolina’s primary shifted her attention from party rival Bernie Sanders to the candidate she may end up facing in November. “I don’t think America ever stopped being great,” she told supporters in Massachusetts, adding a twist to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. “What we need to do now is make America whole.”   (Additional reporting by Amanda Becker, Susan Heavey, Megan Cassella and Eric Walsh; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Frances Kerry and Cynthia Osterman) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"February 4, 2016 ","DURHAM, N.H. (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton went on the attack against rival Bernie Sanders on Thursday in their most contentious presidential debate yet, questioning whether his ambitious proposals were viable and accusing him of an “artful smear” in suggesting she could be bought by political donations. Sanders fought back repeatedly, questioning Clinton’s progressive credentials and portraying her as a creature of the political establishment in a debate that featured heated exchanges on healthcare, college tuition funding and efforts to rein in Wall Street. The intensity reflected a race that has seen Clinton’s once prohibitive lead in polls shrivel against Sanders as the two vie for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 election. One of Clinton’s most forceful remarks came in response to a suggestion by Sanders that she could be influenced by political donations by Wall Street.  “Enough is enough. If you’ve got something to say, say it directly,” she said. “But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received. “So I think it’s time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out,” she said. Clinton charged that Sanders’ proposal for single-payer universal healthcare coverage would jeopardize Obamacare, calling it “a great mistake,” and said his plans for free college education would be too costly to be realistic. “I can get things done. I’m not making promises I can’t keep,” Clinton said. Sanders said he would not dismantle Obamacare but would expand it, pointing to the many other countries that provide universal healthcare. “I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can’t do that,” Sanders said. “By moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have healthcare for all.” Sanders said his proposal for free tuition at public universities would be paid with a tax on Wall Street speculation. “The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now, it is Wall Street’s time to help the middle class,” he said. Five days before New Hampshire holds the second of the state-by-state presidential nominating contests, opinion polls show Sanders, a U.S. senator from neighboring Vermont, with a double-digit lead over Clinton after surprising the front-runner by finishing just barely behind her in Iowa on Monday. Clinton seemed energized by her underdog status in New Hampshire, delivering her most aggressive debate performance of the campaign. It was reminiscent of her 2008 run against Barack Obama, when she also began as the front-runner but became a sharper and less cautious candidate as she began to lose. The debate was the first since former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley dropped out on Monday after a poor finish in Iowa, giving the two candidates more freedom to directly engage each other. Sanders accused Clinton of representing “the establishment,” while saying he represented “ordinary working Americans.” He also noted her Super PAC had taken contributions from Wall Street firms and that Clinton received big speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. Clinton disputed the establishment label, saying it was “quite amusing” to accuse “a woman, running to be the first woman president, as the establishment.” The two battled over who best represented progressive ideals. Sanders said he would lead a “political revolution,” but Clinton questioned his ability to get his proposals through a Republican-led Congress. “A progressive is someone who makes progress,” she said. And she attacked Sanders’ own credentials as a progressive, bringing up his votes against the 1993 Brady bill that mandated federal background checks on gun purchases and his 2005 vote for a bill to protect gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits. “If we’re going to get into labels, I don’t think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady bill five times,” she said. “I don’t think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity.”  Sanders repeated his earlier pledge not to attack Clinton on the controversy over her use of a private email account and a private server for government business when she was secretary of state. “I will not politicize it,” he said. But Sanders renewed his attacks on Clinton for her Senate vote to authorize the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which she has since called a mistake. He pointed out he voted against the war, which he said had led to the rise of the Islamic State militant group. “Look we did differ,” Clinton responded. “A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. “We have to look at the threats that we face right now.” Clinton has tried to play down expectations for her performance in New Hampshire, where she came from behind for an upset victory in the 2008 campaign just days after losing badly to Obama in Iowa. The surprisingly strong performance by Sanders in Iowa is likely to prolong a race that Clinton entered as the presumptive front-runner. In addition to previously scheduled debates in Wisconsin and Florida, the candidates added one in March in Flint, Michigan, to draw attention to the city’s contaminated water crisis ahead of the Michigan primary. They also will debate in April and May.

"February 5, 2016 ","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has erased Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s wide lead for the Democratic presidential nomination since the start of year, putting the two in a dead heat nationally, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Clinton leads Sanders 48 percent to 45 percent among Democratic voters, according to the poll of 512 Americans, conducted Feb. 2-5 following the Iowa caucus. The poll has a credibility interval of 5 percentage points. Democrats had been supporting Clinton by more than a 2-to-1 margin at the beginning of the year. Sanders has narrowed that lead considerably over the past several weeks. Clinton beat Sanders narrowly in the Iowa caucuses, the nation’s first nomination contest ahead of the November election, but is expected to lose to him in New Hampshire. The two rivals clashed on Thursday night in their first one-on-one debate, reflecting the tightness of the race.  There is still a wide gap between the two in name recognition nationally. Nearly a quarter of Democrats and two-fifths of Independents say they are still not that familiar with Sanders. In comparison, Clinton has almost total name recognition among voters.  On the Republican side, Donald Trump continued to lead the field with 40 percent support. His level of support among Republicans was relatively unchanged following his second-place finish in the Iowa caucus. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas followed with 16 percent and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida came in third with 13 percent.  * Democrat poll results: bit.ly/1Ppdeh2 * Republican poll results: bit.ly/1URswih For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, “Tales from the Trail” (here).

"February 6, 2016 ","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A prominent Democratic donor worried about the party’s chances of winning the presidency emailed dozens of fans of Vice President Joe Biden on Friday, urging them to remain prepared to donate if Biden jumps into the race. The donor, Bill Bartmann, cited new polling showing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont nearly tied with the Hillary Clinton, eroding the 30-point lead the former secretary of state held at the end of last year. Bartmann and other party insiders are concerned that Sanders, a self-proclaimed Democratic socialist, is too far to the left to win against a Republican in the Nov. 8 presidential election.  “We cannot afford to lose the White House,” Bartmann wrote in the email, seen by Reuters.  The email drew a string of affirmative responses, also seen by Reuters. Biden announced in October that he would not seek the presidency, despite support from a group of backers under the name “Draft Biden 2016.” But whispers have continued among some donors who hope that Biden could be convinced to run after all should Clinton’s campaign prove fruitless. “My sitting on the sidelines has a lot to do with my disappointment that the vice president decided not to get in the race,” Patrick Baskette, one of the recipients of Bartmann’s email, told Reuters. Baskette, a public affairs consultant in Tampa, Florida, was a special assistant to Biden during his time as a senator.  Baskette said he was not opposed to either Clinton or Sanders. “I don’t think that they offer the solutions to our nation’s future that Joe Biden does,” he added.     Clinton only barely squeaked out a win against Sanders in the Iowa caucus this week, adding to fears that she could lose a nomination that once was thought all but inevitable for her. Clinton is widely expected to lose the New Hampshire primary to Sanders on Tuesday. “Count me in,” Gary Hindes, chief executive of the Delaware Bay Company LLC and a former chairman of the Delaware Democratic Party, wrote on the email chain.  “I am hoping that the stars line up right and that Joe becomes the nominee,” Hindes said to Reuters. “Sanders is too far to the left,” he added, saying Clinton could be vulnerable as well.  “My heart is with Joe,” Hindes said.

"February 7, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he does not have to win the New Hampshire primary vote on Tuesday to secure the nomination, apparently tamping down expectations despite holding a double-digit lead in that state’s polls.     The billionaire businessman came in second to Texas Senator Ted Cruz in the Iowa caucuses last week, although polls put him ahead. His candidacy has alarmed the Republican establishment and has been marked by rows, including over his calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. No Republican has won the presidential nomination without winning either the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary since the 1970s, but it would not technically be impossible.  Asked whether a loss in New Hampshire would derail his campaign, Trump told the NBC News show “Meet the Press”: “I don’t think I need it. I hope that I get it.”  “I would like to win but I don’t know that it is necessary.”    Recent opinion polls give him a lead of between 10 and 22 percentage points over the next closest contender.  Trump has built his campaign in part around his self-declared reputation as a “winner,” and a loss in New Hampshire would intensify doubts that he can translate opinion poll support into votes. He also told “Meet the Press” that he has spent as much as $50 million less than expected on the campaign so far, in part because the media provides him so much free publicity. “People like you put me on. What do I take a commercial for?” Trump told the show’s moderator, Chuck Todd.

"February 8, 2016 ","NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the women who has accused former U.S. President Bill Clinton of sexual assault says she has agreed to work for an anti-Clinton political group being formed by a former advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer who says Bill Clinton groped her in an Oval Office hallway in 1993 when she came to him tearfully seeking a paid job, said she had agreed to become a paid national spokeswoman for a group being created by Roger Stone. Stone, a Republican strategist, said the group would become active should Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton’s wife, win the Democratic nomination in the 2016 race for the White House. Clinton is currently the front runner.  “This gives me more of an opportunity to get this message out to young voters who weren’t even born or don’t even remember what happened and to the women who have suffered,” Willey told Reuters. Willey said she will give interviews and speeches and appear in political advertisements to ensure the accusations remain part of the political discourse during the election campaign.  “They’re going to be confronted every day, on radio, on television, on billboards,” Stone told Reuters, referring to the Clintons. He said he had reached a verbal agreement with Willey  but cautioned that the group was still in the planning stages.  Spokesmen for Hillary and Bill Clinton did not respond to questions about Willey. Stone’s political action committee, which can raise virtually unlimited funds to advocate for or against candidates, was originally created last year under the name Women Against Hillary. It was renamed in January as the Rape Accountability Project for Education PAC, or RAPE PAC.  In a 1998 deposition, Clinton “emphatically” denied Willey’s accusation he groped her, describing her as having “been through a lot” in reference to her family’s financial woes and her husband’s suicide on the day Willey says her encounter with Clinton happened. Clinton has admitted having extra-marital affairs with two other women: Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, and Gennifer Flowers, a singer and actor from his home state of Arkansas, but he and his lawyers have said accusations by other women are false. It’s not clear whether Stone’s group will resonate with voters. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in January found that a majority of the public, including 68 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of Republicans, thought that Bill Clinton’s past sexual misconduct “made no difference” in the current race.   Among women, 56 percent said it did not matter, while another 21 percent said it would hurt Hillary Clinton’s chances of winning the election. Several Republican candidates, particularly Trump, have reminded voters of the allegations while campaigning. The Clintons and their staff have dismissed this as dirty politics. Hillary Clinton’s decision to advocate for victims of sexual assault has persuaded some of her husband’s other accusers, including Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Jones McFadden, to wade into the political season. Broaddrick and Willey say that Clinton, who has said victims of sexual assault have the “right to be believed,” is being hypocritical by doubting her husband’s accusers. When asked about the accusations by Broaddrick, Jones McFadden and Willey at a campaign event in New Hampshire in December, Hillary Clinton replied that people who say they were sexually assaulted should be “believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.”  Stone released a book last year called “The Clintons’ War on Women,” for which Willey wrote the foreword. After leaving Trump’s campaign, Stone created a pro-Trump political action committee, the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness. He says he remains friendly with Trump. Trump himself, angered at Hillary Clinton calling him sexist, described Bill Clinton as “one of the great women abusers of all time” and Hillary Clinton his “enabler” at a campaign event last month. A spokeswoman for Trump, who is barred by Federal Election Commission rules from coordinating with super PACs, did not respond to questions. Stone has also helped to set up an online fundraising page to help raise money to pay for Willey’s mortgage, he said. She said she has been in financial difficult since her husband’s suicide and is facing foreclosure on her Virginia home this month.

"February 9, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Chris Christie considered the future of his struggling U.S. presidential bid on Wednesday amid news reports he would suspend his campaign and narrow the field of rivals facing businessman Donald Trump. A disappointing sixth-place finish in Tuesday’s New Hampshire nominating contest raised doubts about the combative New Jersey governor’s viability as a candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election. The Wall Street Journal quoted a senior adviser to the campaign as saying Christie was expected to make an announcement soon suspending his campaign. Other news organizations carried similar reports. A spokeswoman for Christie’s campaign said no decision had been made about whether he would stay in the race. Christie’s departure would leave eight Republicans from a field that once had 17 candidates vying to represent the party. Trump has dominated the Republican race and won the party primary in New Hampshire on a wave of voter anger at traditional U.S. politicians. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a democratic socialist, defeated former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the state’s Democratic contest.      The results testified to the sizable share of American voters upset over the slow economic recovery, immigration and America’s place in the world and willing to send a shockwave to Washington.  On Wednesday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said he understood the frustration and expected Republican voters to coalesce behind a candidate. “I think it’s pretty normal and I think it’s pretty common and expect that sort of vein is going to play itself out for the next few months and you know we’ll have a unified party when it’s done,” he told CNN in an interview. Christie had poured much of his campaign’s resources into New Hampshire and had considered a good showing there critical. He canceled plans to go to South Carolina, a sign he could drop out soon. The southern state holds the next Republican primary on Feb. 20. “No decision has been made,” Christie spokeswoman Sam Smith wrote in an email to Reuters.          Trump’s opponents, most of them mainstream Republicans, could benefit if Christie pulls out. Ohio’s Republican governor, John Kasich, finished second in New Hampshire, followed by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. For Trump, New Hampshire showed he has staying power and can take a punch after losing last week to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the first nominating contest, the Iowa caucuses. The former reality TV star’s win showed pundits were wrong to think he would quickly self-destruct based on his penchant for insults and imprecise plans for the presidency.    Trump’s odds for winning the White House, once seen as an extremely long shot, improved significantly after his victory in New Hampshire, online betting site Ladbrokes PLC LAD.L said. The real estate tycoon is now at 9/2, compared to 7/1 last week, meaning that his chances of victory in November are now 18 percent. Clinton still had the best odds of becoming president at 50/50, Ladbrokes said.  On the Democratic side, Sanders courted the African-American vote on Wednesday, having breakfast with civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton at a restaurant in New York City’s Harlem neighborhood. Clinton currently has strong support from African-American voters, who will be crucial in the Democratic primary in South Carolina on Feb. 27.  Sharpton and Barack Obama met at the same restaurant during Obama’s successful 2008 presidential campaign - a piece of symbolism for Sanders as he tries to expand his appeal beyond  liberals in the U.S. Northeast. November’s election is followed by the inauguration of Obama’s successor in early 2017. “My concern is that in January of next year for the first time in American history a black family will be moving out of the White House,” Sharpton, a Baptist minister and television talk-show host, told reporters afterward. “I do not want black concerns to be moved out with them. We must be front and center and not marginalized. And Senator Sanders coming here this morning further makes it clear that we will not be ignored.” Sharpton discussed a spate of police shootings of black males and other issues with the senator. Sharpton said he would not endorse a candidate until he met with Clinton. Clinton consistently polls better among African-American voters and has a long history of support for civil rights. She also has benefited from husband Bill Clinton’s popularity in the black community during his presidency, although that became strained during her fierce 2008 primary battle with Obama.     Even before the exit polls on Tuesday showed Sanders had won New Hampshire, Clinton’s campaign was trying to highlight her double-digit lead over Sanders among African-American and Latino voters. “It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among African-American and Hispanic voters,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a memo to reporters. He predicted the Democratic race would be won in March, when the nominating contests quickly expand to 22 delegate-rich states with some of the largest minority and urban populations, and that Clinton would have the advantage.

"Jan 1, 2016","We can t afford to give our US Veterans a proper funeral, but we ve got money to burn when it comes to bringing Muslim refugees to the US from countries who hate us. On average, each Middle Eastern refugee resettled in the United States costs an estimated $64,370 in the first five years, or $257,481 per household. When a veteran or member of the armed forces dies, he or she is entitled to a ceremony that includes the presentation of a U.S. flag to a family member and a bugler blowing Taps. Most of the time, there is a three-volley rifle salute if requested by family members. But now, if the deceased served in the Air Force, the three-volley salute is not an option because the Air Force can no longer support riflemen for funeral services for veteran retirees.Seven member services for retirees included six members to serve as pall-bearers, a six member flag-folding detail, and a three riflemen to fire the salute. Veteran s funerals now only receive the services of two-member teams, who provide a flag-folding ceremony, the playing of taps, and the presentation of the flag to the next of kin. To me, without the 21-gun salute, it just does not make it complete a proper military burial,  veteran Wayne Wakeman told Honolulu s KHON 2 News.  I think because of sequestration or the lack of funds or whatever excuse they re giving, that they had to hit the veterans. Wakeman is correct in supposing the cut is due to sequestration, the 2013 automatic federal spending cuts required by the Budget Control Act of 2011.Rose Richeson, from the Secretary of the Air Force s Public Affairs Press Desk, told We Are The Mighty the policy of restricting the funeral honor is an Air Force-wide requirement. The requirement is consistent with DoD policy which require a minimum of two personnel,  Richeson said.

"Jan 10, 2016","Hillary Clinton s new e-mail release exposes her relationship to some very anti-Israel people. Sydney Blumenthal is a very close friend of the Clintons and exchanges quite a few e-mails with Clinton that are disturbing. Did he have much influence of foreign policy and the inner workings of the State Department. While Clinton claims Blumenthal was a minor character, the e-mails reveal a different story entirely:As Hillary Clinton s email scandals goes  nuclear  with more and more classified material coming to light (including some described as  explosive ), one disturbing trend is coming to light: Hillary s deep contempt for the state of Israel in general, and Prime Minister Netanyahu in particular.When the State Department released more than 5000 pages of Clinton s emails from her private server on New Year s Eve, it included correspondence with her one-time advisor Sidney Blumenthal. The communications revealed an exchange regarding Israel, and Blumenthal cited the work of his son, journalist Max Blumenthal, a self-described  anti-Zionist  known for his radical anti-Israel views.According to the Times of Israel,  In March 2010, Blumenthal plugged his son s work   this time, playing up links between evangelical Pastor John Hagee and Netanyahu   in the context of an article (written by a different writer) discussing a controversial Pentagon briefing on U.S. relations with Israel and the Arab world.   The briefing had dealt with the lack of progress in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and American concerns over a growing perception among Arab leaders that the US was incapable of standing up to Israel. The senior Blumenthal sent several articles written by his son and referenced the younger man s plans to move to Israel for several months to write a book.  He tracks a lot of things that do not appear in the mainstream press,  he wrote to Hillary.Just in time for the 2016 election, hear Hillary Clinton say she would NOT run for president, in  Hillary Unhinged  by Thomas KuiperHillary then took the articles in question and instructed a staffer to print five copies  without the heading from Sid.  She noted the articles came from Max Blumenthal s book  Goliath: Life and Loathing in Greater Israel,  a widely criticized and rabidly anti-Semitic volume that castigated Israeli policies. The Nation s media editor Eric Alterman referred to it as the  I Hate Israel handbook  and wrote Blumenthal s  case against the Jewish state is so carelessly constructed, it will likely alienate anyone but the most fanatical anti-Zionist extremists, and hence do nothing to advance the interests of the occupation s victims. According to the Times of Israel,  Blumenthal also sent Clinton a piece by leftist Israeli Uri Avnery, who also analyzed the Pentagon briefing by leveling a damning critique against Netanyahu. Clinton asked Blumenthal, in response, how she should use this material in an upcoming talk she was supposed to have with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Blumenthal speculated on Netanyahu s psychological makeup by suggesting his actions were motivated by a desperate attempt to live up to his father s expectations.In an email sent immediately after the May 2010 Israeli raid on the Gaza-bound Turkish ship Mavi Maramara in which nine activists were killed, Blumenthal referred to the operation as  Bibi s Entebbe in reverse.  Noting that Netanyahu s brother Yoni was  heroically killed  in the 1976 hostage rescue mission, he said the brothers  father Benzion  adored  Yoni, while the younger Benjamin has always lived in his brother s shadow.  Bibi desperately seeks his father s approbation and can never equal his dead brother (he) has never measured up,  Blumenthal suggested.The senior Blumenthal continued to push his son s anti-Israel views on Hillary. As noted by the Times of Israel,  In 2012, Blumenthal sent his son s article in al-Akhbar,  The Bibi Connection,  to Clinton, who then relayed it onward. The article emphasized Netanyahu s intent to campaign against Obama s reelection in 2012, arguing that  Netanyahu s shadow campaign is intended to be a factor in defeating Obama and electing a Republican in his place.    The article reflected upon Netanyahu s ties to prominent Republicans such as Newt Gingrich, as well as the prime minister s right-wing pedigree. It noted that when his father, Benzion Netanyahu,  returned to Israel to launch a political career, the elder Netanyahu was rejected by Menachem Begin, the (then-)Likud Party leader, who, as right wing as he was, considered him dangerously extreme. Hillary offered a  terse  response on some of Sidney Blumenthal s policy suggestions regarding Israel, upon which he backed off. However,  Blumenthal could not keep Netanyahu out of his semi-retraction, hinting at missed peace opportunities by the Israeli leader:  Of course, if Bibi were to have engaged Syria in negotiations taking its previous gestures seriously   he wrote, before changing the subject without concluding the hypothetical. The email dump revealed Blumenthal was not the only one commenting on Middle East policy. Foreign-policy analyst Anne-Marie Slaughter, formerly the State Department s director of policy planning, wrote to Clinton the  time was right  for the U.S. to recognize Palestine during the emerging of the Arab Spring. It would allow you and POTUS to have accomplished the goal POTUS laid out at UNGA last year and would make it much harder for Syrians, Iranians, even Saudis to use this issue to divert domestic opposition, strengthening the seismic shift across the region to create fault-lines around reform/no reform instead of Arabs/US-Israel,  wrote Slaughter.The Times of Israel notes,  The emails also indicate the existence of a lengthy correspondence over attempts to reconcile Israel and Turkey following the events of the 2010 Gaza flotilla, but the emails are so heavily redacted as to expunge any clue as to what was actually discussed.   Another series details attempts in 2010 to broker direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with significant input from the parties involved in the Arab Peace Initiative.

"Jan 11, 2016","Something about this decision really stinks of favoritism and cronyism. We d love to know who made the decision to punish the American viewers with yet ANOTHER painful appearance by John Kasich on the debate stage over Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul Rand Paul and Carly Fiorina have been booted to the undercard in Thursday night s Republican primary debate as the number of main-stage candidates was cut to seven by stricter polling criteria.Paul, who is struggling to gain traction in the presidential race, immediately cried foul, and vowed to not participate in the event.Fox Business Network, which will televise the sixth GOP presidential debate this week, announced the debate fields on Monday evening, after weeks of speculation that Paul would for the first time not make the cut for the primetime event. The seven candidates who will appear on the main stage in North Charleston, S.C., are Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich. Kasich qualified as a result of his strength in New Hampshire. Paul and Fiorina are set to join Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum in the undercard   if Paul decides to participate. The Kentucky senator told CNN Monday evening, just before the official announcement, that Fox Business had made  a mistake,  and he wouldn t attend. We will not participate in anything that s not first-tier,  Paul said. His campaign confirmed to POLITICO that he will sit out Thursday s debate.His campaign elaborated in a statement that multiple polls showed him well within the network s criteria for qualifying, and contended that the margins of error in polls make them a poor tool for determining who makes the main stage. To exclude candidates on faulty analysis is to disenfranchise the voter,  the statement said.  Creating  tiers  based on electoral results of real votes might make sense but creating  tiers  on bad science is irresponsible. Regardless of whether he takes part in the undercard debate, the downgrade could be a crippling blow for Paul   who has insisted that he would remain in the race through the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, even though he also faces a reelection campaign this year for his Senate seat.In an interview with POLITICO last week, Paul called for organizers to abolish the earlier undercard debate.  I m not sure what the purpose is anymore, if there ever was one,  Paul said. The Paul camp has fought hard to keep its candidate on the main stage, where he has appeared for the prior five debates. Earlier Monday, the campaign released a memo stating that  multiple national polls  have the Kentucky senator  in 5th or 6th place    even though he s in seventh place in the average nationally and in both early states.  By any reasonable criteria Senator Paul has a top-tier campaign and has qualified for the stage,  the memo said.But it was clear that Paul didn t meet the criteria Fox Business had outlined prior to Monday s qualification deadline. The network said it would average the five most recent polls nationally, and in both Iowa and New Hampshire. The top six candidates nationally would qualify   and if any other candidate appeared in the top five in either early state, they would be added.Paul was in seventh place nationally and in both early states, according to POLITICO s calculations.Fox Business outlined specifically which polls were used in a subsequent statement to reporters, saying the outlet used  the most recent national and state polls from non-partisan, nationally-recognized organizations using standard methodological techniques.

They had to be high school graduates of Florida.STEPHANOPOULOS: So you stand behind that?RUBIO: Yes, of a narrowly tailored bill like that, absolutely.In theory, this legislation means that an American student wishing to attend a Florida state university, who is from the neighboring state of Georgia, would have to pay higher tuition costs than an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, who has been living unlawfully in Florida and attending American public schools for the past thirteen years on the taxpayer dime. Illegal aliens are also eligible for generous child tax credits, a benefit protected in the Gang of Eight bill. Indeed, the  taxes  requirement in the Gang of Eight bill would have meant illegal aliens could receive tax payments in the form of free cash from the IRS, since poor illegal aliens have no tax liability.Rubio s plan to discount college tuition for illegal aliens will serve as a further magnet to new illegal immigration, and will also increase competition for college slots and post-college jobs for American youth who are already struggling. Moreover, due to affirmative action policies, these illegal aliens will not have their tuition discounted but their applications given preferential treatment as well.By contrast, front-runner Donald Trump told NBC s Chuck Todd that same day that he opposes Rubio s legislation to give illegal aliens taxpayer-funded tuition discounts.TODD: Senator Rubio sponsored a bill back in Florida (back when he was in the State House) to give in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. There s a lot of states that allow in-state tuition for the children of undocumented immigrants. I ve not heard your position on that.TRUMP: I m opposed to it.TODD: Totally opposed?TRUMP: They re here. They re not here legally. I m opposed to itTODD: Even kids born to illegal immigrants?It is perhaps interesting to note that Chuck Todd seems a bit confused about U.S. immigration policy illegal alien tuition discounts are for foreign-born youth who are themselves illegal immigrants. Under current policy, the US-born children are automatic birthright citizens, meaning no legislation is required to make them eligible for all the benefits enjoyed by Americans. Indeed, illegal immigrants primarily access welfare programs through their U.S.-born children. As a September 2015 report from the Center for Immigration Studies noted,  analysis shows that legal immigrant households make extensive use of most welfare programs, while illegal immigrant households primarily benefit from food programs and Medicaid through their U.S.-born children. Regardless, Trump made clear in the interview he would ensure that neither illegal alien youth (DREAMers) or birthright citizenship children, would be eligible for such benefits. Trump made clear he would move to eliminate birthright citizenship so that the US-born children of illegal aliens would no longer made automatic citizens. Again, by contrast, Rubio supports birthright citizenship a position which is supported by only 20% of Republicans according to the most recent Rasmussen Reports immigration survey issued on December 27, 2015.Rubio s Sunday endorsement of discount college tuition for the foreign-born illegal alien youth is in keeping with his longstanding support for DREAM amnesty proposals, which have been a passion of Gang of Eight co-member [score]Dick Durbin[/score].While Rubio briefly distanced himself of his support for DREAMer amnesty in 2010 in order to get elected to the U.S. Senate and indeed attacked attacked his opponent [score]Charlie Crist[/score] specifically for his support of the DREAM Act upon arriving in the U.S. Senate, Rubio quickly used his new position of power to begin working on a plan to legalize so-called DREAMers. In 2012, Rubio wrote: They re not in compliance with immigration law, and, thus, not American citizens. But they are culturally as American as anyone else s children Rubio s statement might be news to Laura Wilkerson whose 18-year-old son, Joshua, was gruesomely murdered by his DREAMer classmate. In her Congressional testimony last summer, Wilkerson told lawmakers how her son was,  beaten, strangled, tortured until he died. He was tied up, thrown in a field, and set on fire  [During his trial], we had to hear this kid on the stand muttering about,  In my country   In my country  never to finish that sentence. We listened to him tell us repeatedly that his  killing skills took over .  Wilkerson told lawmakers,  You cannot you cannot stand by and ignore our families   our American families. You re elected by Americans, not any other country. You should be for Americans. Yet Rubio remains so committed to amnesty for illegal immigrants who allegedly entered as minors that he has said he will not immediately revoke President Obama s lawless 2012 executive amnesty for DREAMers. In a Spanish-language interview with Jorge Ramos, Rubio said:  Well, DACA is going to have to end at some point. I wouldn t undo it immediately. The reason is that there are already people who have that permission, who are working, who are studying, and I don t think it would be fair to cancel it suddenly. But I do think it is going to have to end. And, God willing, it s going to end because immigration reform is going to pass. Rejected-Majority Leader [score]Eric Cantor[/score] similarly supported Rubio s efforts to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. Cantor declared,  One of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents.  This prompted Cantor s then-primary challenger Rep. [score]Dave Brat[/score] (R-VA) to describe Cantor s declaration as  one of the most radical pro-amnesty statements ever delivered by a sitting representative.  Brat wrote,  In what was billed as a new agenda for the Republican Party, Cantor declared that citizenship for illegals was required by  the great founding principles of our country.  With this remark, Cantor declared his support not only for amnesty now, but amnesty forever. Ken Palinkas, the former head of the nation s immigration caseworkers  Citizenship and Immigration Services has similarly explained how the DREAM Act would represents a promise of  perpetual amnesty :If it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens, then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently?Indeed, government reports have documented how the 2014 illegal alien minor surge on our southern border was caused, in large part, by the promise of amnesty for alien youth.As Senator [score]Jeff Session[/score] has written,  It cannot be the policy of the United States that any of the 2 billion people in the world who have yet turn to turn 18 have a right to illegally enter the United States and claim residency. Polling data suggests that in the event Rubio s position on this controversial DREAMer amnesty begins to receive large-scale media coverage  something that has not happened yet  it could pose problems for him in New Hamspshire, where he is currently in second place. As The Hill reported in 2014,  More people in New England oppose illegal immigration compared to the rest of the country  Nearly 80 percent of people in that region said illegal immigrants threaten U.S. beliefs and customs,  according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.New Hampshire also voted for Pat Buchanan in 1996 who, like Trump, is opposed to both the cheaper foreign labor and cheap foreign imports Senator Rubio has sought to import.Via: Breitbart News",RUBIO DOUBLES DOWN ON Putting Illegal Aliens Before Americans
"Jan 12, 2017","We don t know whether the charges against Fiat Chrysler by Obama s EPA are accurate or not. One thing we do know however, is that much like the announcement today that Obama s DOJ will be going after FBI Director James Comey,  the timing of this announcement by Obama s EPA is certainly suspicious. Only 4 days ago Fiat Chrysler US confirmed the next phase of its industrialization plan by announcing a total $1 billion investment in plants in Michigan and Ohio, and the addition of 2,000 new American jobs. Consistent and combined with previously announced investments, FCA US is further demonstrating its commitment to strengthening its U.S. manufacturing base, and aligning U.S. capacity to extend the Jeep  product lineup. In total, FCA US has committed investments of more than $9.6 billion in its U.S. manufacturing facilities and created 25,000 new jobs to date since 2009.Many were giving Trump credit for creating a more business, and specifically manufacturing friendly environment that seems to be created a tsunami of good news in the way of US manufacturing. The only down side, is that it s shining a pretty big spotlight on the failures of our current over-regulating, punitive administration that has made it almost if not entirely impossible to compete with other countries to manufacture here, in the US. With all the egg Obama and his regime seem to be getting on their faces over the past couple of months, is it really all that surprising that the EPA would make an announcement that would harm Fiat-Chrysler sales and their reputation on the way out the door? Detroit CBSlocal   Fiat Chrysler is denying government charges that some of its diesel vehicles violate federal clean air standards.CEO of Fiat Chrysler Sergio Marchionne saying the allegations are a surprise to him   calling it  absolute nonsense,  reports WWJ AutoBeat Reporter Jeff Gilbert. There was never any intent   of creating conditions that were designed to defeat the testing process,  he says.The comparison to the issues VW is facing regarding deceptive emissions testing is one Marchionne refuses to make.  Anyone who draws a parallel between us and VW   is smoking illegal material. The way in which it has been described I think is unfair to us and that s the thing that bothers me most. The U.S. government is accusing Fiat Chrysler of failing to disclose software in some of its pickups and SUVs with diesel engines that allows them to emit more pollution than allowed under the Clean Air Act.EPA Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles saying emissions software on those vehicles were not disclosed.  Those software elements   not being disclosed in Fiat Chrysler s required application for certification means that the vehicles were sold illegally. The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday it had issued a  notice of violation  to the company that covers about 104,000 vehicles including the 2014 through 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram pickups, all with 3-liter diesel engines. The California Air Resources Board took similar action.Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that its emissions control systems  meet the applicable requirements. The company said it was disappointed with the EPA s action and intends to work with the incoming Trump administration to present its case. Fiat Chrysler said it spent months giving information to the EPA to explain its emissions technology and proposed a number of actions including software changes to address the agency s concerns.Fiat Chrysler s shares fell more than 16 percent after the news was announced to $9.29.If the company is found guilty of this charge they could face huge penalties.Marchionne says the company will work with the new administration to show they are compliant with all EPA standardsBut of course Like a puppy that s been left home alone to run around the home all day, someone s gonna have a lot of cleaning up to do once the Chicago contingent moves out of DC ","IS OBAMA PUNISHING Fiat-Chrysler For 2,000 US Jobs, $1 Billion US Investment Announcement?

Don t you think America is owed an explanation as to why this scumbag was able to meet with Obama following his speech a couple days ago in Omaha? A University of Nebraska-Omaha university professor who used a December 28 Facebook tirade to say  F**k the law,   F**k police,  and  F**k the NRA  was allowed to meet President Obama after his January 13 speech in Omaha.The professor s name is Amanda Gailey. She is also the director of Nebraskans Against Gun Violence.Here is Gailey s Facebook rant in it s entirety:F**k the society that has allowed itself to become so saturated in guns that it s plausible a child might have one at a park. F**k the laws that allow toy makers to make toys that look like real guns and that allow gun makers to make guns that look like toys. F**k racists who think black children look like adults. F**k a legal and police system that allows grown white men to pose with sniper rifles on a university campus or in a grocery store and allows insurrectionists to train guns on government agents with no consequences but sounds the alarms when a black child is carrying a toy gun. F**k police officers who undertook a job that carries inherent risk but think any perceived threat to them whatsoever justifies instantaneous lethal force. F**k police officers who pull up as close as possible to an alleged threat so that they can execute the person as quickly as possible without assessing the situation first. F**k prosecutors who can indict a ham sandwich but can t indict a cop who executed a child. And f**k the NRA for greasing this machine every fucking day with the blood of American children.On January 14 weeks after the original post was put up Gailey put up another post in which she attempted to explain that her criticism of police was limited to  bad-apple officers,  not good ones. And she was specifically outraged by the fact that the no charges were filed against officers who shot 195 pound, 12-year-old Tamir Rice after a 911 dispatcher told officers  a young man [was] playing with a weapon and pointing it at people outside of a local recreation center. Gailey wrote:I did write a Facebook post that expressed my outrage at the police shooting of a 12-year-old child and the failure to indict the bad-apple police officers involved. My criticism of the police was limited to those officers who engage in that kind of policing, which I believe is clear in my post. I did not malign the police in general, nor did I want to, because I respect the many good officers who serve our communities and have even helped me in the past. I know that most police officers are doing hard work in hard conditions, and they are in the front lines of a society saturated in guns, facing threats that police in our peer nations do not. They are key players in our struggle for safe and fair communities.This is Gailey s explanation for  F**k the police  as well as  F**k the society,   F**k the laws,  and  F**k the NRA,  among other things.

Within seconds we were tossed around and they took stones from a gravel bed on the corner and threw them at us,  said Elisa.A police car appeared at the train station as the stoning attack unfolded and arrested the men.The German media as a general rule do not disclose the last names of victims to protect their privacy. The three men are between 16 and 18 years-old and are known to the authorities from theft and assault arrests.Dortmund police official Kim-Ben Freigang said the suspects told the police that  such persons must be stoned. Yasmine installed a security camera at the residence where she lives with Elisa after the attacks.  That was barbaric what they did. They are barbarians,  Yasmine said.She added that she could not believe that such an act of shamelessness occurred.  In 2016, in Germany, with stoning!

"Jan 17, 2016","This is a mind-blowing interview that confirms much of what many of us suspected about the Clintons. For some, it may be even worse than what they believed to be true. Kudos to Linda Tripp for agreeing to do this interview. People who cross the Clinton s do usually fare too well In a rare interview, Linda Tripp, a pivotal figure in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, revealed on Sunday it was common knowledge while she worked in the West Wing that Bill Clinton had affairs with  thousands of women. Speaking on  Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,  Tripp for the first time divulged that she personally knew another White House staffer aside from Lewinsky who was also having an affair with Clinton. That unnamed staffer was mentioned by Tripp in various depositions but she has not spoken about it publicly.She charged that Hillary Clinton not only knew about her husband s exploits,  She made it her personal mission to disseminate information and destroy the women with whom he dallied. Tripp says she cringes at the sight of Clinton presenting herself as  a champion of women s rights worldwide in a global fashion, and yet all of the women she has destroyed over the years to ensure her political viability continues is sickening to me. Tripp documented evidence of Lewinsky s phone calls about her relationship with Bill Clinton and submitted the evidence to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, leading to the public disclosure of the affair. She explained to Klein that she did so because she believed her own life and Lewinsky s were in danger, saying that Lewinsky was threatening Clinton with outing the relationship.Tripp also used the interview to criticize what she says is the news media s unwillingness to investigate the Clintons. She singled out and thanked Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report, declaring that without him  things would have been very, very different. Drudge s website was the first media outlet to break the Lewinsky scandal after Newsweek sat on the story.Tripp had unique access to the Clintons because her office was directly adjacent to Hillary s second floor West Wing office for the entire time she served in the Clinton White House from 1993 to the summer of 1994 with the exception of the first three months of the Clinton administration, when she sat just outside the Oval Office.Tripp s nonpartisan position was a carryover from the George H. W. Bush administration in which she served. Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made She told Klein that her role in the Lewinsky case followed  years of alarm at what I had seen in the Clinton White House, particularly Hillary and the different scandals, whether it was Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater, Vince Foster. All of the scandals that had come before and were so completely obliterated in the mind s eye of the American people because of the way all of them were essentially discounted. So I watched a lying President and a lying First Lady present falsehoods to the American people. So my dismay predated the January 1998 period when the Monica Lewinsky scandal surfaced. To me it was very important that the American people see what I was seeing. My years with the Clintons were so disturbing on so many levels. Tripp maintains that she went public with the Lewinsky evidence to ensure the intern s safety as well as her own.She told Klein:I say today and I will continue to say that I believe Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made and action I took. That may sound melodramatic to your listeners. I can only say that from my perspective I believe that she and I at the time were in danger, because nothing stands in the way of these people achieving their political ends.I think that had it not become public when it did, particularly in light of the Paula Jones lawsuit, which was coming to a head with President Clinton s deposition, that we may well have met with an accident. It s a situation where unless you lived it as I did you would have no real framework of reference for this sort of situation.Tripp said the young Lewinsky, 21-years-old when she entered the White House as an intern, was unaware of the danger that she faced.She described Lewinsky as a  young girl, smart, clever   but in this one area she was blinded and she fancied herself in love. He fancied himself entitled. It was nothing more than a servicing agreement. She romanticized that there was an affair. And when it didn t pan out the way she had hoped it would   he had promised her he would bring her back to the White House as soon as the 1996 election campaign had finished. When he didn t, she essentially lost her mind and started acting in erratic and frightening ways. Threatening the president.There came a point in July of 1997 when she not only threatened to expose the affair, as she referred to it. But also she at that time informed him that I knew all about it. So at that time it became dangerous for Monica and for me. This was something that absolutely could never see the light of day. And she never realized the implications of threatening a president or her behavior. And I did.Tripp told Klein that  the biggest fallacy that most people believed is that this was a unique occurrence. Monica was somehow special. And regrettably that s the farthest thing from the truth. She said,  Everyone knew within the West Wing, particularly those who spent years with him, of the thousands of women. Now most of your listeners might find that difficult if not impossible to believe. And I can tell you in the beginning I felt the same way. But let me be clear here. This is a pattern of behavior that has gone on for years. And the abuse of women for years. Asked whether Clinton was having affairs with others in the West Wing, Tripp replied,  I know that to be true. One in particular who I will not name told me this herself. But as to the hundreds or thousands, remember I worked closely with the closest aides to the president. And it was a loosey-goosy environment so there was not a lot of holding back. So it was common knowledge, let s put it this way, within the West Wing that he had this problem. It was further common knowledge that Hillary was aware of it. Tripp described the tense West Wing atmosphere between what she characterized as two almost diametrically opposed Clinton camps.The dynamic between the two groups   the Bill Clinton people and the Hillary Clinton people. It was as though they were almost opposing forces. But I can tell you that the one with the power and the one that instilled the fear in the other was the Hillary camp.And the [Bill] Clinton people would cower if she were coming into the area, just as an example, of the Oval without notice. There would be scurrying around to make sure there was no one in the wrong place at the wrong time, shall we say. It was a fascination to see the amount of energy that was expended covering up his behavior. It was horrifying.Tripp said Hillary personally targeted Bill s female conquests and accusers, with the future presidential candidate exhibiting behavior that is  egregious and it s so disingenuous. In my case, for instance, right after the Lewinsky story broke, she was heard directing her staff to get anything and everything on Linda Tripp. So the defamation of character and the absolute assurance that my credibility would be destroyed began right away. And it happens with any woman who is involved in any way, either with him in a physical relationship or an assault or anything that can endanger their political viability.Tripp recalled Hillary s January 27, 1998 appearance on NBC s The Today Show in which she was seen as standing by her husband while blaming the Lewinsky scandal on a  vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president. She didn t do it in an honest way,  said Tripp of Clinton s NBC interview.  Instead she lied, which didn t surprise me. And I will give her credit. She is enormously effective. And became a victim. A wife who was betrayed. This is someone who had no real personal problem with any of this behavior. The problem was in it becoming public. They had to continue to become electable  She was the more aggressive one in ensuring that the political viability was not endangered in any way. Tripp told Klein that Hillary  does not possess integrity on any level. I just wish that your listeners could know the person that I knew. Because if they did there is not a chance she would be elected president. Tripp s ringside seat afforded her rare insight into the scandals of the 1990s and perhaps alleged wrongdoings to come, with the West Wing employee personally witnessing behavior that may have foreshadowed Clinton s email scandal, in which she is accused of sending classified materials through her personal server.Tripp said she noticed major differences in the manner in which classified material was handled by both the Clinton and Bush administrations in which she served.President George H.W. Bush s administration had  a completely different way of operating on every level, including on classified and secret material,  she said.She continued:All the regulations were followed, right down to a cover sheet being essential if the document had had any sort of classifications. The securing of classified documentation in safes. The burn bags that were used if any sensitive material was to be disposed of. All of this was familiar to me and followed every security protocol that I had experienced in the past.When the Clintons came in this was one of the things that I found appalling right from day one. And it went hand and hand with the disdain for the military. The military was present in the White House in the form of presidential aides. The aide that carried the nuclear football, just as an example. And in the Bush White House they were respected, as they should be. In the Clinton White House, they were disdained. To see it treated this way and to see these people treated this way was disturbing.Tripp referred to Clinton s private mail woes as  classic Hillary Clinton in a nutshell. She gets to decide what she does. Look, the rules don t apply to the Clintons. If you understand that basic premise you understand the Clintons. For Tripp, Clinton s use of a private server was  all about control. She has a need to control every single aspect of her life. And you know anyone in government knows that any key stroke on a keyboard within a government agency belongs to the government  it is not up to the employee on any level to control what happens to it for posterity.

"Jan 18, 2016","It s good to know there are a few Hollywood celebrities who haven t bought into Obama s false messiah B.S During an appearance before the U.K. s House of Lords on Tuesday, Hollywood actress and human rights advocate Angelina Jolie spoke out about how Islamic State group militants use sexual violence as a means to perpetuate terrorism   and about how we need strong leadership (unlike that of President Barack Obama) to overcome this threat.Jolie s excoriating speech laid bare just how anemic and pitiful Obama s response to ISIS has been, and how ISIS is being allowed to build a society based on rape, violence, and of course Shariah law. They are dictating it as policy beyond what we have seen before,  Jolie said.  They are saying,  We should do this, this is the right way to build a society, so we tell you to rape. Islamic militants are basically building a civilization not focused on growing food or educating children, but rather on kidnapping, enslaving and raping women, to perpetuate the endless cycle of terrorism, and Obama has allowed these barbaric radical Muslims to thrive. The most aggressive terrorist group in the world today knows what we know, knows that it is a very effective weapon and they are using it as a centrepoint of their terror and their way of destroying communities and families, and attacking and dehumanising,  Jolie explained. For over 10 years, I had been visiting the field and meeting families and survivors of sexual violence who felt for so long that their voices simply didn t mater, they weren t heard, and they carried a great shame,  Jolie continued.She added that we need  a very, very strong response at this time  to stop this horrific behavior. Of course, we have been calling on Obama to make that strong response for years, but he s far more interested in race baiting back home than dealing a death blow to radical Islam.Jolie does have some measure of expertise in the matters she s speaking of. As she told the Houses of Parliament, she has been campaigning for Middle Eastern victims of sexual abuse for over a decade (H/T The Gateway Pundit).Below is an excerpt of Jolie s address, this part dealing with some of her encounters with young rape victims.https://youtu.be/KBmHnzjgwSkIt seems like Jolie is someone whose words President Obama should heed.

There is no line the union bosses won t cross to keep the unions dues flowing .The list, obtained by the 7 Investigators, is creating a stir among current and ex-union members in southeast Michigan.The Warren chapter of the UAW, Local 412, appears to publicly shame those opting out of the union   listing 43 workers who,  choose not to pay their fair share. Paying members are encouraged to virtually shun them, the union saying,  do not share any tools, knowledge or support for any of these employees.

"Jan 20, 2016","Legendary singer and great patriot Charlie Daniels has been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration in the past but THIS is the best ever overview of the drip, drip, drip of Muslim refugees coming to every town in the U.S: If what happened in Cologne and other cities in Germany on New Years Eve, when young Muslim men insulted, groped, robbed and raped German women who were on the street celebrating the holiday doesn t wake Germany up, they are in for a long and probably irreversible ride.Angela Merkel s reckless act of allowing one million refugees into the country may seem like a great humanitarian gesture to some, but as the ramifications of such a foolish move begin to reach street level, Germany will be in for a long, national nightmare.The grotesque acts that occurred on New Year s Eve were not isolated incidents, but happened nationwide with the earmarks of single intentioned flash mobs operating in numbers too large to control and overtaxing the law enforcement personnel available to deal with it.Some of the ones who were detained told police that they couldn t do anything to them, that they had been invited into Germany by Ms. Merkel, as if that was a license to harass and abuse the girls without consequences.A million people from another culture, who practice another religion, who have no regard for women s rights and who believe that Western Society is decadent, who refuse to assimilate and don t believe they are bound by the laws of the host country, is a lot to turn loose on any society at one time, and New Year s Eve was just a small harbinger of things to come. Even if the troublemakers represent just 2 percent of the population of refugees, that is still approximately 20,000 people that can cause a lot of problems for Germany.This is before the terrorist component has made itself known. Merkel, in her rush to out politically correct other world leaders has imported the agents of death into her country. The genie is out of the bottle, and German children will suffer the ramifications of Angela Merkel s folly for generations to come. In rejecting a 200,000 limit on the number of refugees entering the country, it seems Merkel plans to allow even more refugees in 2016.It s too late for Germany. They have opened the zoo, and lions walk among them. Soon the terror attacks will begin, and the Muslim population explosion will, in relatively few years, create a significant voting block that will grow exponentially. Unlike native Germans who abort millions of their unborn each year, most Muslims don t practice abortion, and their tradition of having multiple children per family only accelerates the process.And once again, we are beaten over the head with the truth that  not all Muslims are terrorists,  but it doesn t take a majority to be dangerous.It s not too late for America, despite the fact that Obama seems determined to expose our society to the same dangers that Germany faces.This president has a weak spot for things Muslim. Whether it s his father s heritage, his upbringing, his education at an Indonesian madrassa or a combination of all of the above, I just don t know. It s apparent every time he talks about the  holy Koran  or the  Prophet  with such reverence, and it also reveals itself in his insistence that Islam has absolutely nothing to do with terrorism.He got taken to the cleaners by the Mullahs in Iran, who actually did little besides promise not to develop a nuclear device for 15 years, and since their word has all the value of a Zimbabwean penny, nobody but Obama believes they ll honor the terms of his incredibly weak deal   a deal that unfreezes billions of dollars which Iran will no doubt use to continue funding terror.In fact, Iran may have already violated the treaty by taking United States sailors, whose boats reportedly drifted into Iranian waters, into custody and subjecting them to humiliation, even broadcasting it on television all over the Islamic world to show how impotent the  Great Satan  really is.By the time they freed our sailors, they had pulled off a public relations coup farther emphasizing their disrespect and their opinion of just how weak, ineffective and disengaged they consider Obama to be.All of this doesn t seem to bother Obama though. He is determined to turn over one hundred and fifty billion dollars to this bunch of loose cannons, and he seems bent on bringing in thousands (tip of Obama s iceberg) of Muslim refugees, when we have already been told that ISIS has infiltrated operatives into the numbers.I believe that the only thing that protects America from further insults and aggression from Putin, China and anybody else who has an ax to grind with us is the grace of God and the fact that our enemies are afraid that America may elect a president with some backbone and the courage and guts to protect our interests.While there is a whole world out there that respects only power and those willing to use it, Obama extended a limp olive branch, which has been snatched out of his hand and is being used to beat him with.Never send a boy to do a man s job.What do you think?Pray for our troops and the peace of JerusalemGod Bless AmericaCharlie DanielsCharlie Daniels is a legendary American singer, song writer, guitarist, and fiddler famous for his contributions to country and southern rock music.

On Sunday, agents caught a group of seven illegal aliens near the river and when they took them to the station for processing learned that one of them identified as Walter Leonel Vasquez Zacarias was a violent sexual predator, court records obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed.Court records revealed that Vasquez Zacarias had been convicted of  aggravated sexual battery victim under 13 years of age  in March 20, 2009. For that offense, Vasquez was initially arrested on June 16, 2008 in Augusta County, Virginia and after his conviction was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but for unknown reasons, eight years from his sentence were suspended and he was deported in March 30, 2010 through Houston.Vasquez continues to be listed in various search engines as a violent sexual predator.In recent days, agents arrested four other criminal aliens with a sexually based criminal history, information provided to Breitbart Texas by Border Patrol revealed. One of the aliens was from Guatemala and he had a previous conviction for aggravated sexual battery of a victim under the age of 13. Another of the aliens was also from Guatemala and he had a conviction for aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Two other aliens from Mexico had convictions for indecent liberties with a child and the other for sexual assault.

Denmark is a major pork producer and it is the most popular meat, but it is forbidden to Muslims and Jews. Most of the asylum-seekers who have arrived in the country in the past months are Muslim.Noergaard, a member of the anti-immigration, populist Danish People s Party that proposed the council motion, said Thursday that it wasn t meant as a  harassment of Muslims,  but added that he had received  several complaints about too many concessions  being made to Muslims in the small, predominantly Lutheran country. The signal we want to send here is that if you re a Muslim and you plan to come to Randers, don t expect you can impose eating habits on others. Pork here is on an equal footing with other food,  Noergaard told The Associated Press. He said that halal meat, vegetarian dishes and diets for diabetics would still be available.In 2013, then-Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt lashed out at some nurseries after they started serving halal-butchered meat instead of pork because Muslim children had refused to eat it.

People talk about the problems in the Republican Party, but I think Democrats have a bigger problem,  the former New York governor told host John Catsimatidis on  The Cats Roundtable  on New York s AM-970 on Sunday. Hillary Clinton is cratering, the scandals just keep coming. She has grave legal issues that could totally prevent her from continuing her campaign, and the alternative is a self-avowed socialist who has never run anything. Pataki added that it would not surprise him to see an  outsider jump into the race  like Vice President Joe Biden, California Gov. Jerry Brown or Secretary of State John Kerry. Despite his previous pronouncements that Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has no chance at the GOP nomination, Pataki conceded that his prediction isn t borne out by reality.

"Jan 25, 2016","You seriously can t make this up. This Democrat run city is officially out of control. We reported before that the EPA knew about this crisis long before they told anyone, yet the media and the Left continues to try to pin the blame squarely on Michigan s Republican Governor. This latest threat is just another  black eye  for the officials handling the Flint, MI water crisis As the water crisis in Flint deepens, it is becoming apparent that the effects of the lead-infested water are not just a health hazard, but the situation has the potential of ruining many more lives outside of the poison issue. There is no denying that the water in Flint is undrinkable and that it is contaminated with lead and other substances, and it is clear that the government of Flint is responsible for the problem.However, the city s government continues to charge people for the poison water and then threatening to foreclose their home or take their children if they refuse to pay. Michigan law states that parents are neglectful if they do not have running water in their home, and if they chose not to pay for water they can t drink anyway, then they could be guilty of child endangerment.Activists in Flint say that some residents have already received similar threats from the government if they refuse to pay their bills.Flint residents have recently filed two class action lawsuits calling for all water bills since April of 2014 to be considered null and void because of the fact that the water was poisonous. We are seeking for the court to declare that all the bills that have been issued for usage of water invalid because the water has not been fit for its intended purpose,  said Trachelle Young, one of the attorneys bringing the lawsuit, in court. Essentially, the residents have been getting billed for water that they cannot use. Because of that, we do not feel that is a fair way to treat the residents,  Young added.Recent estimates have indicated that it could take up to 15 years and over $60 million to fix the problem, and the residents will be essentially forced to live there until the problem is solved. Despite the fact that the issue is obviously the government s responsibility, they have made it illegal for people to sell their homes because of the fact that they are known to carry contaminated water. Meanwhile, residents are still left to purchase bottled water on their own, in addition to paying their water bill.Although this problem is finally getting national media attention in Flint, they aren t the only city with contaminated water supplies. In fact, a recent report published by The Guardian showed that public water supplies across the country were experiencing similar issues.This crisis highlights the many dangers of allowing the government to maintain a monopoly on the water supply and calls attention to the fact that decentralized solutions to water distribution should be a goal that we start working towards.Via: DC Clothesline",FLINT RESIDENTS TOLD TO PAY BILLS FOR POISON WATER Or They May Have Their Children Taken Away

Shouldn t they have addressed how Americans are becoming victims of violence by followers of Islam instead?The Islamic advocate and fashion-blogger invited by Google and Fox to question the GOP s 2016 candidates at the Jan. 28 debate is also a supporter of far-left 2016 candidate, Democrat Sen. [score]Bernie Sanders (I-VT)[/score]Noor, who describes herself as an advocate for Islam, earlier posted a video portraying Adolf Hitler in agreement with Trump.Noor s affiliation with far-left Sanders showcases the post-1960s radical political shift among America s far-left advocacy groups.Before the 1960s, these left-wing groups pushed for Marxist-style economic policies they thought would aid poorer, working-class Americans, regardless of color, by transferring wealth and power from industry and factory-owners.But after the 1960s, the far-left leaders gradually shifted their focus away from economics and towards cultural policies. Under this  cultural Marxism,  progressives believed they would aid racial and sexual minorities   and now Islamic minorities   by transferring cultural power and status from ordinary Americans, especially from white working-class Americans and away from individualistic-minded Christian churches.Many large business groups and very wealthy individuals have welcomed and funded this shift from  Economic Marxism  to  Cultural Marxism. Since then, the left s culture-war against ordinary Americans  long-evolved, equality-promoting and pro-ideal culture has forcibly imposed  diversity  on society, which has divided Americans into angry factions and sharply reduced the pre-1970s political pressure for higher taxes on very wealthy individuals.The shift has also caused the Democratic Party to fight for increased immigration, much to the delight of business groups and Wall Street, who make enormous financial gains from an increased inflow of cheap workers and welfare-supported immigrant customers. Those economic gains flow to many major companies, including Google and Fox, who are producing the Jan. 28 debate.Because of this divide-and-rule diversity strategy, progressive Democrats   including President Barack Obama   are also encouraging the migration of devout Muslims and their theocratic political leaders into the United States.The resulting spike in jihad attacks, the migrants  high use of welfare and the spread of their religious ideology   which stigmatizes woman and sexual minorities and ordinary non-Muslim Americans that are the base of the Democrats  disparate political coalition   and progressives  increasingly shrill contempt for Americans who dislike of Islamic ideology, are just the costly civic side-effects imposed on Americans by progressives  reach for political power and social status.Muslim advocates are useful for progressives because they rally immigrant Muslim voters and they help to spike American social conflicts, which boosts the civic conflict, or  diversity,  that benefits business groups and far-left, secular, anti-Christian, progressive leaders. For example, Noor s anti-Trump video initially displayed a fake twitter image claiming that Trump tweeted  Muslims should be treated no differently than sex offenders.

"Jan 29, 2016","One of my personal favorite conservative writers, Nick Short has done an amazing job in this piece, where he traces the roots of the Black Lives Matter and cop hating movements to our Divider In Chief. If you re not familiar with his work, Nick Short at politicallyshort.com is worth visiting. His work is supported  by reader donations. If you re so inclined to support him, I m sure he would appreciate it. When the organization known as Black Lives Matter (BLM) was first formed right after George Zimmerman s acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin on July 13, 2013, most overlooked the true intentions of the group beyond their calls for  justice . Fast forward to today and it can no longer be overlooked that their calls for justice now result in retaliatory violence against those whom they believe are the oppressors, namely those being white people in general and police officers specifically. By tracing the origins of the organization back to its philosophical formation in the 1960 s, we can begin to see how BLM is rooted in the radical ideological beliefs espoused by none other than President Barack Obama.Before we get to that point though, it is crucial for us to understand that BLM was founded by three militant feminists by the name of Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opel Tometi. While each played their part in contributing to the creation of the group, Garza is the driving force as she detailed the philosophy behind BLM in her October 2014 article titled A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement. Garza writes the following in regards to BLM s philosophy: Black Lives Matter is a unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes. It goes beyond the narrow nationalism that can be prevalent within some Black communities, which merely call on Black people to love Black, live Black and buy Black, keeping straight cis Black men in the front of the movement while our sisters, queer and trans and disabled folk take up roles in the background or not at all. Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, Black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum. It centers those that have been marginalized within Black liberation movements. It is a tactic to (re)build the Black liberation movement. Alicia Garza explains why she started the Black Lives Matter terror movement. Notice how she ties her hate for law enforcement into her discussion about taking action against anyone who doesn t agree with their radical tactics:The Activist Web: Alicia Garza from Ford Foundation on Vimeo.The key takeaway from Garza s statement is found in the last two sentences primarily as she notes that BLM was created with the intention to  (re)build the Black liberation movement.  The reason this statement is of utter importance is because it ties directly to the idea of Black Liberation theology, which was the doctrine taught to Obama for over twenty years at his church in Chicago made famous by Obama s pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Black Liberation theology was first formed on July 31, 1966. In an article published by NPR it is noted that: Black liberation theology originated on July 31, 1966, when 51 black pastors bought a full page ad in the New York Times and demanded a more aggressive approach to eradicating racism echo[ing] the demands of the black power movement. What is often overlooked in the formation of the group is the linkage between the Nation of Islam and Black Liberation theology as Wright s mentor and founder of Black Liberation theology James Cone credited Malcolm X with  shaking him out of his theological complacency.  Stanley Kurtz of National Review highlighted this synergy in noting that according to Cone,  The black intellectual s goal is to aid in the destruction of America as he knows it.  Such destruction requires both black anger and white guilt. The black-power theologian s goal is to tell the story of American oppression so powerfully and precisely that white men will  tremble, curse, and go mad, because they will be drenched with the filth of their evil , wrote Cone.In an excerpt from Stanley Kurtz s piece drawing on the influence of Malcom X on Black Liberation theology, Kurtz states:So what exactly is  black power ? Echoing Malcolm X, Cone defines it as  complete emancipation of black people from white oppression by whatever means black people deem necessary.  Open, violent rebellion is very much included in  whatever means ; like the radical anti-colonial theorist Frantz Fanon, on whom he sometimes draws, Cone sees violent rebellion as a transformative expression of the humanity of the oppressed Theologically,  Cone affirms,  Malcolm X was not far wrong when he called the white man the devil. The false Christianity of the white-devil oppressor must be replaced.   Couple these words to Obama s pastor Jeremiah Wright s statement that  there will be no peace in America until whites begin to hate their whiteness  and you can begin to understand that the rhetoric behind Black Lives Matter that blames  white privilege  for virtually everything is rooted in Black Liberation theology. However Wright was radicalized , notes Bud White of NoQuarterUSA,  it is clear that he consciously appropriated the language and tenor of the Nation of Islam.  White documents the following:Wright s statement that 9/11 was deserved retribution ( We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans America s chickens are coming home to roost ) is a perfect echo of Malcolm X s statement that  The assassination of Kennedy is a result of that way of life and thinking. The chickens came home to roost.  Although it appears that Wright began his focus on Black Liberation Theology sometime after 1966, his racial attitudes and rhetoric have imitated that of NOI since at least 1970. Wright s blaming the United States for creating AIDS to kill minorities is but just one example of his thinking being in lockstep with NOI. The Nation of Islam and Black Liberation Theology are two doors to the same room. Black Liberation Theology is a  palatable  form of  Christian  black nationalism. The fiery anti-American, race-baiting words of Wright, Cone, and others behind the theology of Black Liberation  are from the same philosophical cauldron as the Nation of Islam , concludes White.From the beliefs that served as Obama s bedrock foundation for his ideology, is it any wonder that today that the radicals behind Black Lives Matter and the Nation of Islam are allowed a free pass to incite as much hatred and retaliation against those they deem are the oppressors? As violence has ramped up in the first half of 2015 in targeted assassinations against police officers, little to no coverage by the media is given to a meeting that was hosted by the White House on December 1st.On December 1, 2014, Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder met with seven Black and Latino organizers   from Ferguson, Mo.; Columbus, Ohio; Miami, Florida; and New York City, who had been leading the ongoing actions to disrupt the status quo. In an article posted by the website FergusonAction, it is explained that during this meeting activists such as Ashley Yates were given the platform by the White House in order to reaffirm their belief that  most violence in our (their) community is coming from the police departments, and something needs to be done about it.  On December 20th  something was done about it  as two uniformed NYPD officers were assassinated in their marked car by Ismaaiyl Brinsley in what Brinsley himself boasted as an act of retaliation for the death of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York at the hands of the police.The reason Yates is emphasized here is because she, like BlackLivesMatter founder Alicia Garza, praise cop killer and former Black Liberation member Assata Shakur as a martyr for their cause. Yates even created T-shirts and hoodies that read  ASSATA TAUGHT ME  in a reference to Shakur that has become part of BLM s iconography. The fact that the president would even entertain the thought of meeting with those like Yates and other  activists  who hold cop killers as icons for their movement further goes to show how Obama s belief in Black Liberation theology, primarily that retaliation and violence should be used to further their cause, has never left him. Why else would Obama have met with these  activists  unless he was sympathetic to their plight, which given the fact that Obama spent over twenty years of his life listening to Jeremiah Wright s sermons, he very much is. Since this meeting though, what cannot be dismissed is the fact that violence in the form of targeted assassinations of both white people and police officers, have ramped up.And it will only get worse the longer we continue to allow Obama s Department of Justice to remain idly complicit.",HOW BLACK LIVES MATTER Terrorists And Cop Killings Can Be Traced Back To Barack Hussein Obama

"Jan 3, 2017","Republicans have put forward a plan to stop Obama administration s last minute regulations Tuesday. These  midnight regulations  published after the 2016 presidential election could cost the American taxpayer over $44 billion.California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa re-introduced legislation Tuesday that would allow Congress to overturn executive branch regulations finalized in the last 60 legislative days of an outgoing presidential administration.The bill amends the Congressional Review Act, which would allow Congress to recoup the ability to essentially curb numerous regulations rushed through the regulatory process in the last days of an outgoing administration at one time.Issa s office claims the bill is designed  to stem a growing trend by Presidents, of both parties, to use their last few months in office to rush in costly, expensive or controversial new regulations. The legislation, expected to be approved by the House Wednesday, was already introduced with support from the Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Tom Marino. Regulations impacting the economy, the environment, families, and our community should be done with great caution and transparency, not get rushed in last-minute on a President s way out of office. This is a good piece of legislation that will help keep this and future Presidents in check. The Midnight Rules Relief Act is a reasonable plan to strengthen executive branch oversight, giving Congress a better tool to ensure regulations are limited and, when necessary, approved in an open and transparent manner,  Issa said in a statement.

Not only is he visiting a mosque claiming Americans have been misbehaving bigots (we haven t) but he s visiting a mosque with extremist ties!  There he goes again poking his finger in the eye of America. One thing he hasn t held back on this last year of his presidency is showing his true colors by screwing America. The Baltimore mosque President Obama has chosen as the first U.S.-based mosque to visit during his presidency has deep ties to extremist elements, including to the Muslim Brotherhood.The White House announced on Saturday that Obama will visit the Islamic Society of Baltimore (ISB) on Wednesday. He has visited several mosques overseas as president but has resisted visiting one in the homeland. The purpose of the trip, according to the White House, is to  celebrate the contributions Muslim Americans make to our nation and reaffirm the importance of religious freedom to our way of life. But ISB is a curious choice for Obama s first domestic visit.The mosque is a member of a network of mosques controlled by the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), a Muslim civil rights group named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 2008 Holy Land Foundation terror case. Several executives with that organization were convicted of sending money to aid the terrorist group Hamas.Read more: Daily Caller",OBAMA’S FIRST VISIT TO A U.S. MOSQUE Raises Questions About Its Extremist Ties

Chobani has filled 30 percent of its 600 positions at the world s largest Yogurt plant in Twin Falls, Idaho, with refugees resettled in America through a U.S. State Department program carried out in cooperation with the United Nations.Ann Corcoran, author of the Refugee Resettlement Watch blog, said the potential conflict of interest is disturbing and should be questioned by Twin Falls residents. Twin Falls is really a microcosm of what we find going on in so many of the refugee communities across the U.S., where you have people moving in and out of government and the Chamber of Commerce with a vested interest in making sure a meatpacking plant or some other industry has continuous access to refugee labor,  said Corcoran.  Only in this case we have a blatant example of conflicts of interest by an elected official who is also the head of the Chamber enticing companies to come in and make use of the steady influx of cheap, overseas labor. These are jobs that Americans would be happy to fill but they are forced to compete now with someone from Sudan or Iraq who is used to working for a dollar a week. The local Muslim community in Twin Falls grew out of its mosque and built a new, much larger house of worship last year.Here s Chobani CEO s response to Trump s moratorium on refugees from 7 countries:  This is very personal for me,  Ulukaya wrote in internal memo to his staff that was obtained by CNN.

"Jan 6, 2016","Because blaming the Muslim migrants who raped and sexually assaulted an untold number of women on New Years Eve would be politically incorrect and certainly not very hospitable A political scandal is developing in Germany as ordinary citizens wake up to the scale of the migrant crime cover-up, and the callous reaction of the mayor of Cologne to mass-sex crime on new year s eve.The Mayor of Cologne has spoken out about the attacks, but her carefully chosen words are unlikely to delight many. Rather than addressing the root causes of the violence   unlimited mass migration and a totally failed system of integration   the newly elected pro-migrant mayor instead blamed the victims of the sexual abuse for having failed to defend themselves against the immigrant attackers.Here is a video of the shocking chaos that took place on New Years Eve:Speaking on live television this afternoon mayor Henriette Reker, who was near-fatally stabbed in the run up to October elections by an anti mass migration campaigner, said in future women would have to be better prepared in her city to deal with migrants.She remarked:  The women and young girls have to be more protected in the future so these things don t happen again. This means, they should go out and have fun, but they need to be better prepared, especially with the Cologne carnival coming up. For this, we will publish online guidelines that these young women can read through to prepare themselves .What form this guidance will take is presently unclear, the mayor could take inspiration from young victim whose modest clothes protected them from the worst consequences of walking at night in areas controlled by migrant men. The woman said:  Fortunately I wore a jacket and trousers. a skirt would probably have been torn away from me .Despite her words of warning towards women in the city they could prepare for more violence against them, she refuted the suggestion there was any link between the attacks and migrants, contradicting her own chief of police.An opposition council member has today sounded the alarm bell on the deteriorating state of control the local government has over the city of Cologne, and in an official letter from the council group has warned those planning to come to the famous Cologne council next month  the city and the police  are unable to guarantee the safety of locals and tourists .Council group leader and lawyer Judith Wolter said in her letter to the people of Cologne today:  I want as a member of the Cologne City Council  to submit a travel warning for the carnival time in Cologne city centre. Especially the area in and around the central station, the cathedral and the adjoining area towards the banks of the Rhine for tourists (and locals) is no longer considered even in normal times as safe. For months, there is in these areas numerous thefts, open drug dealing, robberies and harassment of all kinds  Dozens of women were sexually harassed in public and there was at least one rape. Neither the city nor the police are able to guarantee in the territory described the safety of tourists and locals. Especially for women it must be assumed that a high security risk is here in the evening and night hours. At New Year s Eve there was a legal vacuum and a no-go area for women. With the climax of the Carnival season it is unfortunately expected to be a similar situation .German police have admitted to losing several urban areas to migrant gangs as so-called no-go zones, but this is possibly the first time a public square in the centre of a European city has been acknowledged by officials as having been lost to criminality, and out of the control of police at night.News of the attacks was suppressed for days, with just short reports of isolated incidents in Cologne city centre making it to local outlets on New Year s Day.The Kolnifsche Rundschau described the scene at the railways station as  largely peaceful  and made no effort to describe those who attacked the young women, one of which told press she had  fingers on every orifice  after she was stripped near naked.Only after nearly 100 victims of assault and abuse came forwards to police, and stories of attacks started circulating on social media did the truth of the situation start to slowly emerge, forcing local police to hold a press conference on Monday afternoon.Despite the chief of police admitting the enormous scale of sexual assault and confirming the attackers were of  North African and Arab  origin, much of the mainstream media is still in damage control mode, either trying to shift the focus from migrants, or avoiding the events completely.

"Jan 9, 2016","WOW! This is a powerful, must read letter that should be shared with every American Lately, I must admit that my hostility towards your political ilk has ramped up, pretty dramatically. No, it s not because we, at this point in my life, have a half-black president in the White House, and I m some closet racist who is becoming increasingly frustrated at the prospects of the White Man s power slipping through my fingers. I know that you ve accused our side of such nonsense, and the thought keeps you warm at night, but I can assure you that it is a comfortable fiction of which you should probably divest yourself.Now before I waste too much of your time, let s establish who I m talking to. If you believe that we live in an evil, imperialist nation from its founding, and you believe that it should be  fundamentally transformed , lend me your ears. If you believe that the free market is the source of the vast majority of society s ills and wish to have more government intervention into it, I m talking to you. If you believe that health care is a basic human right and that government should provide it to everyone, you re the guy I m screaming at. If you think minorities cannot possibly survive in this inherently racist country without handouts and government mandated diversity quotas, you re my guy. If you believe that rich people are that way because they ve exploited their workers and acquired wealth on the backs of the poor, keep reading. Pretty much, if you trust government more than your fellow American, this post is for you.First of all, let me say that we probably agree on more things than you think. Even between Tea Party Patriots and Occupy Wall-Streeters, I ve observed a common hatred of the insidious alliance between big business and big government. As Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) so correctly noted, government should never be in the business of picking winners and losers in corporate America, and no person, organization, union, or corporation should have their own key to the back door of our government.Second, contrary to popular belief, conservatives really are concerned with the plight of the poor in this nation. You accuse us of being uncompassionate, hateful, racist, and greedy, but studies have shown that when it comes to charitable giving, conservatives are at least (if not more, depending on the study you read) as generous as liberals in caring for the poor. The difference between us is not in our attitude towards the problem   it s our attitude towards the solution. We believe that the government does practically nothing well (since without competition or a profit motive there is no incentive to do well) and has made the plight of the poor far worse than it would have ever been had government never gotten involved. For a stark example of this, look no farther than the condition of the black family in America since the  War on Poverty  began. You believe that more government is the answer, and that if we only throw more money at the problem, the problem will go away. We believe, as Reagan so aptly stated,Government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem.Third, as people who might actually have to avail ourselves of a doctor s services at some point in our lives, we are just as concerned with the condition of America s healthcare system as you are. While we believe that America has the world s most capable physicians, has the world s most innovative pharmaceutical industry, and is on the cutting edge of medical technology, we also understand that the delivery system is far from perfect. However, unlike you, we see a grave danger in turning the administration of that delivery system over to the same entity that is responsible for giving us the United States Postal Service. There are private sector solutions that should certainly be explored before we kill the system, altogether, by giving it to the government to run.Now that we ve touched on a couple of points of common ground, allow me to explain my aggressiveness towards your efforts to implement your progressive agenda. First, let s talk about the word  progressive , since you now seem to prefer that word to  liberal . In order to label something as progressive or regressive, one must have some idea as to what constitutes progress. What is the ideal towards which you are striving? An idea is considered progressive if it moves us closer to the ideal and regressive if it moves us further away. So, what is your ideal society?Though I can t begin to discern the thoughts of every liberal who may read this, nor can I assume that every liberal has the same notion of an ideal society, in my arguments with liberals over the years, I couldn t help but notice the influence that FDR s Second Bill of Rights has had in shaping the beliefs of the modern liberal with regards to domestic policy. The rights that FDR cited are: The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation; The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation; The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living; The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad; The right of every family to a decent home; The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health; The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment; The right to a good education.At this point, you re probably screaming,  Right on!! , and who can blame you? What sane person in the world doesn t want everyone to be gainfully employed, adequately fed, smartly clothed, appropriately sheltered, and properly educated? These are the goals of every moral society on the planet, however we cannot ignore the fundamental question of,  At what cost? I m not sure whether FDR was a shallow thinker or simply a shrewd, Machiavellian politician, but the fact that he framed each of these ideals as a human right should be troubling to every freedom-loving person in America. After all, what does it mean for something to be a human right? Doesn t it mean that it s something to which you are entitled simply by virtue of your being human? Let s think about some of the basic rights that the real Bill of Rights delineates: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to petition the government, freedom to bear arms, freedom from illegal search and seizure, etc.If you re moderately intelligent and intellectually honest, you ll quickly see what separates the rights laid out in the real Bill of Rights from those laid out in FDR s misguided list   none of the rights listed above require the time, treasure, or talents of another human being.Your right to speak requires nothing from anyone else. Your right to practice your religion requires nothing from any of your fellow citizens. Your right to bear arms means that you are allowed to possess weapons to defend yourself and your family, but it makes no demand that a weapon be provided to you by anyone. A true human right is one that you possess, even if you re the only person on the entire planet   and it is unconditional.FDR s list is no  Bill of Rights . It s a list of demands. If I have a right to a job, doesn t that mean that one must be provided to me? If I have a right to adequate food, clothing, and recreation, doesn t that mean that I am entitled to those things, and someone should provide them to me? If I have an inherent right to a decent home, once again, doesn t that mean it should be provided to me, regardless of my ability to afford one or build one for myself?You might protest that FDR only meant that we have the right to pursue those things, but that s not what he said, and why would he? If we live in a free society, our right to pursue those things is self-evident, is it not? Besides, if he only believed in our right to pursue those things, he would not have felt the need to implement the New Deal.You may be getting anxious, now, wondering what FDR s Second Bill of Rights has to do with my antipathy towards your political philosophy. It s quite simple   your political beliefs are a threat to liberty   not just for me, but for my three boys and their children as well. I care much less about the America that I m living in at this very moment than I do about the one that I m leaving Nathaniel, Charlie, and Jackson.How does your political bent threaten my and my sons personal liberty, you ask? In your irrational attempt to classify things such as clothing, shelter, health care, employment, and income as basic human rights, you are placing a demand upon my time, my treasure, and my talents. If you believe that you have a right to health care, and you are successful in persuading enough shallow thinkers to think as you do, then it will place a demand upon me to provide it to you. If you believe that you have a right to a job, and more than half of America agrees with you, as a business owner, I am obligated to provide one to you, even if it means making my business less profitable.The fact is, you can rail against my conservatism all you wish. You can make fun of my Tea Party gatherings, and you can ridicule patriots in tri-corner hats until you wet yourself from mirth, but one thing is for certain: my political philosophy will NEVER be a threat to your freedom. If you feel a burning responsibility to the poor, conservatism will never prevent you from working 80 hours per week and donating all of your income to charity. If you feel a strong sense of pity for a family who cannot afford health insurance, my political philosophy will never prevent you from purchasing health insurance for this family or raising money to do so, if you cannot afford it, personally. If you are moved with compassion for a family who is homeless, a conservative will never use the police power of government to prevent you from taking that family in to your own home or mobilizing your community to build one for them.However, you cannot say the same for liberalism. If I choose not to give to the poor for whatever reason, you won t simply try to persuade me on the merits of the idea   you will seek to use the government as an instrument of plunder to force me to give to the poor. If we are walking down the street together and we spot a homeless person, using this logic, you would not simply be content with giving him $20 from your own pocket   you would hold a gun to my head and force me to give him $20, as well.Everything that modern liberalism accomplishes is accomplished at the barrel of a government rifle. You do not trust in the generosity of the American people to provide, through private charity, things such as clothing, food, shelter, and health care, so you empower the government to take from them and spend the money on wasteful, inefficient, and inadequate government entitlement programs. You do not trust in the personal responsibility of the average American to wield firearms in defense of themselves and their families, so you seek to empower the government to criminalize the use and possession of firearms by private citizens. Everytime you empower the government, you lose more of your personal liberty   it s an axiomatic truth.What angers me the most about you is the eagerness with which you allow the incremental enslavement to occur. You are the cliched and proverbial frog in the pot who has actually convinced himself that he s discovered a big, silver jacuzzi. Somehow, you re naive enough to believe that one more degree of heat won t really matter that much.I have the utmost respect for a slave who is continuously seeking a path to freedom. What I cannot stomach is a free man who is continuous seeking a path to servitude by willingly trading his freedom for the false sense of security that government will provide.I am reminded of Samuel Adams  impassioned speech where he stated: If ye love wealth (or security) better than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude than the animating contest of freedom,   go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains sit lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen!  Servitude can exist in a free society, but freedom cannot exist in a slave nation. In a free country, you have the liberty to join with others of your political ilk and realize whatever collectivist ideals you can dream up. You can start your own little commune where the sign at the front gate says,  From each according to his ability; to each according to his need , and everyone can work for the mutual benefit of everyone else. In my society, you have the freedom to do that.In your society, I don t have the same freedom. If your collectivism offends me, I am not free to start my own free society within its borders. In order for collectivism to work, everyone must be on board, even those who oppose it   why do you think there was a Berlin Wall?In conclusion, just know that the harder you push to enact your agenda, the more hostile I will become   the harder I will fight you. It s nothing personal, necessarily. If you want to become a slave to an all-powerful central government, be my guest. But if you are planning to take me and my family down with you, as we say down here in the South, I will stomp a mud-hole in your chest and walk it dry.Bring it.Jeremy N.

"January 13, 2016 ","OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama visited a young family in their suburban Nebraska living room on Wednesday, the first stop on what the White House said will be a year-long tour to talk before he leaves office about fixing the country’s polarized politics. His trip to Nebraska, a Republican “red state,” is meant to help promote the big-picture ideas he laid out in his final State of the Union speech on Tuesday, where he said he regretted American politics had become more rancorous. Obama spent about 40 minutes visiting with Lisa Martin, who sent him a letter last year she wrote at 4 a.m. when she was awake feeding her son Cooper. In the letter she described her “overwhelming sense of dread” about climate change. “Will he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snow days and sledding?” Martin wrote in the letter, expressing feelings of powerlessness. “Call it sleep deprivation or desperation, but something made me want to email the president that night, so I did,” Martin said on Wednesday. Afterwards, Obama reprised his address to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd of 11,000 at a hockey rink at the University of Nebraska, a state where he acknowledged he got “whupped” in his 2012 re-election campaign. Obama said that American economic and foreign policy is stronger than described by “a bunch of folks right across the river” - a jab at Republican presidential candidates campaigning for the party’s nomination in the early voting state of Iowa. “That’s just hot air. That’s bluster. That’s not serious,” Obama said. “There’s another word for it that starts with a ‘b’ - it’s baloney,” he said. Obama has said he hopes to work with the Republican-led Congress on a few issues where there is common ground in his final year: criminal justice reform, passing a sweeping Asian trade deal, and addressing heroin addiction and poverty. But on a host of issues Congress does not support him, such as curbing climate change, and the race to win the Nov. 8 election to succeed him overshadows Obama’s push to cement his legacy. Obama was due to fly on Wednesday to Baton Rouge, Louisiana - another red state - where he will take questions from residents at a town-hall meeting on Thursday.

"January 14, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration will announce as soon as Friday an overhaul of how the United States manages coal development on federal land, according to government and conservationist sources, in a further move to confront climate change. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Democratic President Barack Obama said he would “change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.” The new plan will require federal officials, when weighing land use decisions, to consider how mining and burning coal adds to greenhouse gas pollution, said environmental group sources familiar with the plans. The overhaul also will aim to maximize returns for taxpayers by updating royalty rates when mining companies pull coal from federal land, said the sources. “We’re working to have this tomorrow,” said a Bureau of Land Management official who declined to give details on the administration’s plans. Environmentalists have urged the White House to freeze new coal leases on federal land until it accounts for how that fossil fuel development contributes to climate change. A moratorium on coal leases could be part of the reform, said environmental sources familiar with the effort. Coal leases are often awarded without a competitive bidding process, frequently going to a single bidder, and officials can undervalue the fuel heading to market, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has concluded. “Public lands should be developed in the public interest but taxpayers have been shortchanged for decades,” said Theo Spencer of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land. The coal industry had been battered in recent years by competition from cheap natural gas and clean-air regulations that have raised costs for burning the black rock. This week, Arch Coal, one of the nation’s largest coal companies, filed for bankruptcy - the latest mining company to seek protection from creditors in the current downturn. The National Mining Association was not immediately available for comment. ",White House to revamp U.S. coal program as soon as Friday: sources
"January 15, 2016 ","NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and top challenger Ted Cruz ended a longstanding truce in spectacular fashion on Thursday night with bitter exchanges during what may have been Trump’s strongest debate performance to date. The New York billionaire and the Texas senator appeared to have a split decision by the end of the night, a sign that for all the bluster, little took place that could derail Trump from his lead position with a contest in Iowa on Feb. 1 to begin the search for a Republican presidential nominee. Projections that the debate would be a free-for-all were accurate. Beyond the Trump-Cruz theatrics, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida turned in a pugnacious performance with attacks on Cruz and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Florida Governor Jeb Bush presented himself as a voice of reason against Trump. A Google snap poll showed viewers believed Trump, who in the most recent debates was at times less engaged, won the night with 37.3 percent to Cruz’s 26.6 percent and Rubio’s 12.1 percent. Until the Fox Business Network debate in North Charleston, South Carolina, Trump and Cruz had been friendly because they have both been chasing conservatives of the Tea Party movement and did not want to anger them. With Trump now needing to fend off Cruz’s rise in Iowa, he pushed his charge that Cruz may not be constitutionally qualified to serve as president because he was born in Canada. The U.S. Constitution says only “natural born” citizens can become president of the United States. “Who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?” Trump told Cruz, drawing a scattering of boos in the audience. Born in Calgary, Alberta, to a U.S. citizen mother and a Cuban father, Cruz accused Trump of bringing up his birthplace simply because Cruz was leading some polls in Iowa. Cruz said Trump, who led the movement questioning whether the Hawaiian-born President Barack Obama was really from the United States, had asked his lawyers to look into the issue of Cruz’s birth in September and concluded there were no issues. “Since September, the Constitution hasn’t changed, but the poll numbers have,” Cruz said. “And I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are dropping in Iowa, but the facts and the law here are really clear.” Trump said Democrats would sue if Cruz were on the Republican ticket, putting their party’s chances of winning at risk. Cruz shot back that he had spent many years studying constitutional law: “I’m not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.” The birthright issue has dogged American politics before: 2008 Republican nominee John McCain survived questions about his birth in Panama because he was born on a U.S. military installation there and it was judged to be U.S. soil. In 1967, Republican candidate George Romney faced questions about his birth in Mexico, but his candidacy never advanced far and the issue was abandoned. While Cruz seemed to have parried the attack for now, he was stung by Trump on another issue: Whether people who live in New York City have the same values as other Americans. Cruz has lately begun denouncing “New York values” to connect Trump to the city’s famous liberalism. “Everyone understands that the values of New York City are socially liberal, are pro-abortion, are pro-gay marriage,” Cruz said. Trump, in perhaps his most heartfelt remarks of the night, harked back to New York’s response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to defend his home city. “The people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death... And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.  “And we rebuilt Downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made,” Trump said. Rubio, in third place behind Trump and Cruz in Iowa and hoping a strong outcome there will help him in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9, frequently inserted himself into arguments and tried to put pressure on Cruz. He accused Cruz of proposing a value added tax as part of     his tax plan and of being soft on immigration. “That is not consistent conservatism,” he said. “That is political calculation.” He attacked Christie as well, accusing him of have liberal positions on education policy and abortion. Christie interrupted a Rubio-Cruz exchange with this blast: “I’d like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate. You had your chance, Marco you blew it,” he said. Cruz, who has taken the lead in some polls of Iowa Republican voters, did well on social media. Social media monitoring tool Zoomph saw total positive mentions for Cruz climb by more than 150 percent while he sparred with Trump. Trump is far ahead nationally.  A Reuters/Ipsos rolling national poll on Jan. 12 showed Trump had 39 percent of the vote, Cruz 14.5 percent, Bush 10.6 percent, Carson 9.6 percent, while 6.7 percent favored Rubio.

"January 16, 2016 ","WASHINGTON - U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday laid out a plan to help support the income of workers who lose their jobs and end up in lower paying positions, as part of a push to get unemployed Americans back to work. The proposal would offer experienced workers who now make less than $50,000 a form of wage insurance, allowing them to replace half of their lost pay. The benefit would cover up to $10,000 over two years. “It’s a way to give families some stability and encourage folks to rejoin the workforce - because we shouldn’t just be talking about unemployment; we should be talking about re-employment,” Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address, broadcast on Saturday. The wage insurance proposal will be included in a broader effort to overhaul the unemployment insurance system. Details about the program’s proposed funding will be further outlined in Obama’s budget for fiscal year 2017 expected to be released next month. Obama promised in his State of the Union earlier this week to advocate for legislative action on issues with bipartisan support during his last year in office. During the address, he pointed to wage insurance as one measure where lawmakers may be able to work together. The White House plan would require states to provide insurance for workers laid off from jobs they had held for at least three years. The plan would be federally-funded, but it would be administered through state unemployment insurance programs. Other measures proposed by the White House on Saturday included a requirement that all states provide at least 26 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits, and the creation of a permanent program that would automatically provide up to 52 additional weeks of federally-funded benefits for states experiencing rapid job-losses or high unemployment.

"January 17, 2016 ","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ted Wade hasn’t cared about politics enough to cast a vote in a U.S. presidential election for almost a quarter of a century, back when he supported Ross Perot’s independent candidacy in 1992. But Republican Donald Trump’s 2016 White House bid has motivated Wade to get involved and he plans to support the real estate mogul in Nevada’s nominating caucus next month. Trump is a “non-politician” who can fix the “chaos” in Washington, he says. About one in 10 Americans who plan to cast a vote this election will do so for the first time in years, if ever, and Trump holds a decided edge with them, according to polling by Reuters/Ipsos. (tmsnrt.rs/1SgeLvi) These voters offer Trump a pool of voters who could be decisive either in the Republican primaries or a general election. They could be crucial for Trump in early-voting states such as Iowa and South Carolina, where his nearest rival, Senator Ted Cruz, is putting pressure on Trump and enjoys a strong base of support with more traditionally conservative voters. In Reuters/Ipsos polling from June to December 2015, 27.3 percent of these “new” voters said they would vote for Trump, higher than his poll numbers among independents and Republicans who regularly vote. By way of comparison, Cruz captures just 3.4 percent of these voters. And Senator Marco Rubio of Florida snags only 4 percent. “I’m tired of the chaos between Democrats and Republicans and want to give somebody a try who I think can make a difference,” said Wade of Trump. The 51-year-old has already switched his affiliation from Democrat to Republican and even attended a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas. He has told his three older children to get involved in the elections, although he did not say whether he wanted them to vote for Trump.  Trump, the Republican front-runner, has made targeting “lost” voters such as Wade a focus of his campaign. His anti-immigrant rhetoric and protectionist trade proposals have helped him to fashion a message tailored to reach Americans alienated by the endless enmity between the political parties and who, because of declining economic prospects, may feel like neither party has done much for them. Trump’s strategy is a gamble, given the lack of reliability of many of the voters with whom he is most popular. In interviews, some of those lost voters insist they will show up, saying they are drawn to Trump’s outsider status and his willingness to upend the political system. Tucson, Arizona, resident Renay Cunningham, 56, said she had never paid much attention to politics in the past. She plans to cast her first ever vote for Trump after hearing his proposed policies to curb illegal immigration, which include building a giant wall on the southern border and making Mexico pay for it. “We need a piranha in there, and he’s definitely a piranha,” she said. Trump and his operatives are confident they can do what few of his rivals for the Republican nomination have shown they can do — expand the party’s potential voter pool. But while Democrat Barack Obama did that eight years ago by largely registering new voters, including record levels of minorities, both male and female, in urban centers, Trump’s campaign has instead largely sought out the disaffected, who tend to be overwhelmingly older, white, and less educated than the broader electorate. “My whole campaign has been focused on expanding the number of people who want to, and will, participate in this election cycle,” Trump wrote in a recent op-ed in USA Today. When analyzing “lost” or “new” voters, Reuters compiled poll results from people who haven’t voted in the previous two presidential campaigns and midterm congressional elections. The results focused only on those who said they were nearly certain to vote in the November election. It included responses from 3,440 “new” Republican and independent voters – a sample that has a credibility interval of 2 percentage points. Jan Leighley, an expert on turnout at American University, said it’s too soon to compare Trump’s “new” voters with the disenfranchised voters, especially minorities, who in 2008 turned out in record numbers to elect the first black president. Those voters didn’t find their way to the polls simply because they were inspired to make history, Leighley said. “He also had a kick-ass mobilization structure.” “Obama’s campaign went door-to-door. They canvassed whole neighborhoods. “I don’t know if he (Trump) has the campaign infrastructure to make sure that the folks who are riled up are walked to the polls on Election Day,” she said. Trump’s campaign insists he does have the infrastructure, but won’t provide specifics on how it intends to turn casual supporters into engaged voters. The campaign says it does follow up with the thousands of attendees who jam arenas for Trump’s rallies. That’s one significant advantage the reality star has over the other candidates in the Republican field, as the challenge in reaching voters who have fallen out of the political process often lies in simply locating them. “We’ve identified a lot of people in early primary states who have not participated in the process before,” campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Reuters. Lewandowski resists the notion that Trump needs to turn out “new” or reluctant voters to win states such as Iowa. Even if the Trump campaign isn’t necessarily counting on them, it may be reassuring that his supporters among “new” voters who responded to the Reuters/Ipsos survey appear motivated to cast a vote for him. At least for the time being. Ronald Thomas, a 49-year-old truck driver and Navy veteran in North Carolina, said he, too, has never voted in a presidential contest. His girlfriend would push him to vote but he would always say “Yeah, but the right one ain’t come along yet,’” Thomas said. Trump is that man. His willingness to take on the government has set him apart as someone who would “actually look out for the people,” said Thomas. Now he wants to know how to register so that he can vote for the billionaire.  And there’s Vince DiSylvester, a retired maintenance worker in Missouri, who, at 73, said has never cast a ballot for president. But Trump has inspired him to rethink that. “He’s a businessman, he knows business, he knows how to get things done,” he said. “And he tells it like it is. If you don’t like it - well, too bad.”  (Editing by Ross Colvin) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",Many 'lost' voters say they have found their candidate in Trump
"January 18, 2016 ","LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers on Monday debated a petition to ban U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump from Britain over remarks on Muslims, but while describing his comments as “crazy” and “offensive”, most said the ban would go against free speech. Members of parliament said Trump should be allowed into Britain where his views could be challenged, that a ban would give him more publicity or that it was not for Britain to get involved in U.S. affairs. Trump caused outrage last month with his comments that Muslims should be banned from entering the United States. He spoke after 14 people died in a shooting spree in California by two Muslims whom the FBI said had been radicalized. His comments prompted more than half a million Britons to sign a petition calling for him to be barred from entering the country, where he has business interests. The three-hour debate saw lawmakers from all sides criticize Trump’s comments. While it was not followed by a vote, many more lawmakers spoke against a ban than for it. “I want to see Donald Trump come to this country ... I want him to get a sense of the fury and the frustration with his xenophobic remarks,” said Gavin Robinson, a lawmaker from Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party. Only interior minister Theresa May can issue an order banning entry into Britain and Prime Minister David Cameron has said while Trump’s comments were “divisive, unhelpful and wrong”, he does not back the idea of barring him. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said the government did not comment on who it was considering for exclusion but said “a frank and open exchange of views” was the most effective way to influence Trump. “The U.S. remains our most important bilateral partner. It is in the UK’s interests that we engage all presidential candidates, Democratic and Republican, even though we may disagree profoundly on important issues,” he said. “I believe it is for the American people to hold him to account. It is bad politics ... to intervene in the electoral processes of other countries,” said Conservative lawmaker Tom Tugendhat. Some spoke passionately in favor of banning Trump however, saying he should not be treated differently from others who have been banned for similar views. “Just think what would happen in the current climate if he came ... and preached that message of divisive hate,” said Jack Dromey, an opposition Labour Party spokesman on home affairs.  “To have someone come to our shores who demonizes all of the Muslim community would be fundamentally wrong and would undermine the safety and security of our citizens and that is not a risk I am prepared to take ... I don’t think Donald Trump should be allowed within a 1,000 miles of our shore.” Trump has threatened to cancel over 700 million pounds ($1 billion) of planned investments in golf courses in Scotland if he is banned. Trump International Golf Links in Scotland said in a statement: “It is absurd that valuable parliamentary time is being wasted debating a matter raised as part of the American presidential election.”  (Additional reporting by Stephen Addison, Editing by Michael Holden and Janet Lawrence) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",British lawmakers debate banning Trump after Muslim comments
"January 19, 2016 ","LANSING, Mich (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, facing protests, lawsuits and calls for his resignation over drinking water contamination in Flint, on Tuesday apologized to the city’s residents and called for the state to spend $28 million on fixes. “To you, the people of Flint, I say tonight as I have before, I am sorry and I will fix it,” Snyder said in his annual speech to lawmakers, adding that federal, state and local leaders had failed residents. Snyder, a Republican, asked lawmakers to authorize $28 million in spending on diagnostic tests, health treatment for children and adolescents, replacement of old fixtures in Flint schools and day care centers and a study of the city’s water pipes. He also said additional funding would be needed. Some people have reported rashes, hair loss and other problems since Flint, under a state-appointed emergency manager,  switched to Flint River water in April 2014 from a Detroit-run water system to save money, attorneys for the residents said. Complaints about the water began within a month of the switch, but Flint did not return to Detroit water until October 2015 after tests showed elevated levels of lead in Flint tap water and in some children. The corrosive river water caused more lead to leach from Flint pipes than Detroit water did, increasing contaminants in the tap water. President Barack Obama met on Tuesday with recently elected Flint Mayor Karen Weaver over the crisis, which has become part of the U.S. presidential debate with candidates on both sides questioning the slow response. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it acted too slowly to address the situation in Flint. Snyder promised to release his Flint-related emails from 2014 and 2015 on Wednesday. He has rejected calls for his resignation by some protesters. “Lansing failed in one of its most basic functions, ensuring the well-being and health of our citizens,” state House Democratic Leader Tim Greimel said after the speech. At least 1,000 people protested at the Capitol on Tuesday, some holding baby bottles filled with brown water. “The governor has a business agenda and his business agenda was to take over the water to profit in it,” said Lila Cabbil, a demonstrator from Detroit. Several lawsuits have been filed. The latest on Tuesday asks a judge to stop Flint from issuing shutoff notices to residents, who are still receiving bills for water declared undrinkable. Attorney Cary McGehee said lawyers have heard from more than 500 people reporting health problems and financial hardships. ",Michigan governor apologizes for Flint water crisis
"January 20, 2016 ","NORWALK, Iowa (Reuters) - When it comes to influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential race, Sarah Palin’s star power is turning out to be dimmer than expected.  There was no ecstasy in the crowd when the former Alaska governor and vice presidential nominee endorsed Republican front-runner Donald Trump at a rally in Ames, Iowa, on Tuesday night. And at Trump’s next appearance on Wednesday in Norwalk, people who came to see him - both hard-core Trump supporters and undecided voters - said Palin was not swaying them. “They’re going to have to do an image remake of her,” said Joani Estes, 56, of Indianola, Iowa. Estes said her Pentecostal Christian faith made her feel aligned with Palin, but it did not make her feel any more strongly about Trump. She liked him, she said, and was likely going to caucus for him during the state’s nominating contest on Feb. 1 - but she was also keeping the door open for his closest rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Her friend Jenny Terrell, 55, said Palin’s endorsement made her less certain about her support for Trump. A longtime Democrat, Terrell said she had been inspired by Trump but was put off by Palin’s extreme opposition to abortion rights.  “I was a little disappointed,” she said, adding that even though she knew Trump had declared himself to be against abortion, she did not see him as being as fervently anti-abortion as Palin. As a strategic move in Trump’s competition against Cruz in Iowa, getting an endorsement from Palin made sense, political experts said. She is popular among tea party Republicans who rail against the political establishment, as well as blue-collar evangelical Christians, two groups from which Cruz draws strong support.  It is not yet clear whether evangelical leaders in the state will follow Palin’s lead and choose Trump over Cruz. But Trump had already managed to draw some of those voters with his brash, sweeping talk of keeping refugees out of the United States, building a wall along the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration, and putting education policy back in the hands of local communities.  “I could care less” about Palin’s support for Trump, said Scott Heckart, 49, who said he had made up his mind to caucus for the billionaire businessman and former reality TV star.  Even Andrew Haup, 26 - who said he decided to support U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, only after McCain made Palin his running mate - said her endorsement mattered little to him since he had already made up his mind to support Trump. Near the back of the room where Trump spoke on Wednesday morning, Matt Burns, 47, a Cruz supporter, stood alone. He said he had only come to see Trump because his teenage daughter had asked him to take her. He said he liked Palin and was not angry at her for choosing Trump over Cruz, but said her choice was not going to sway him. “For me it doesn’t really do a whole lot,” he said. “I think most people know who they’re going to caucus for.”  (Reporting By Emily Flitter; Editing by Jonathan Oatis) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",Palin's endorsement fails to excite Trump rallygoers
"January 21, 2016 ","(Reuters) - Oregon’s governor blasted the federal government’s response to the occupation of a wildlife refuge by a group of armed men saying the situation was “absolutely intolerable” and costing the state about $100,000 a week.  Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, said she had been asked by federal officials to limit her public comments about the protest which began on Jan. 2 at the remote Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and that she had no wish to escalate the situation. “But I will say this ... The situation is absolutely intolerable and it must be must be resolved immediately. The very fabric of this community is being ripped apart,” Brown said on Wednesday at a news conference.  “The residents of Harney County have been overlooked and under-served by federal officials’ response thus far.” The takeover at Malheur was the latest flare-up in the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion, a decades-old conflict over the U.S. government’s control of millions acres of land in the West. The occupiers have declared their move is in support of two local ranchers who were returned to prison this month for setting fires that spread to federal land. The ranchers’ lawyer has said the occupiers do not speak for the family.          Law enforcement officials have so far kept their distance from the buildings at the refuge, 30 miles (48 km) south of the small town of Burns in rural southeast Oregon’s Harney County, in the hope of avoiding a violent confrontation. One of the occupiers was arrested last week after he drove a government vehicle to a local supermarket.  Brown called the situation a “spectacle of lawlessness” which must end and said she had conveyed her very grave concerns to the U.S. Department of Justice and the White House. “Federal authorities must move quickly to end the occupation and hold all of the wrongdoers accountable,” the governor said. “And until Harney County is free of it, I will not stop insisting that federal officials enforce the law.” The chair of the local Native American tribe has also called on the federal government to remove the occupiers. Brown said the standoff was costing Oregon about $100,000 per week, mostly in additional law enforcement costs, and that she has asked her finance officials to “scour the budget” so they could subsidize the expense to Harney County. “We will be asking federal officials to reimburse the state for these costs,” she said.

"January 22, 2016 ","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Advocates and opponents of capital punishment sparred on Friday over California’s proposed new lethal injection protocol, highlighting deep divisions in a state that houses a quarter of U.S. death row inmates but has not executed anyone in a decade. The plan to use barbiturates to execute inmates sentenced to die in the most populous U.S. state drew fire from religious activists, who called capital punishment grisly and anti-democratic at a hearing in Sacramento. Law-and-order advocates urged its adoption. “As of next month, the state will have been remiss in its duties for a decade,” said Michele Hanisee, vice president of the Los Angeles Association of Deputy District Attorneys. “The family members of the victims are dying before the murderers.” The informational hearing was part of the state’s process for adopting a new protocol for lethal injection that would use one drug, a barbiturate, to put condemned inmates to death. It would replace a three-drug cocktail that a California court declared unconstitutional 10 years ago because it could possibly cause pain. Under a court settlement, the state must develop a new procedure for executions. At the same time, Californians have grown more divided over capital punishment, with nearly half the electorate and many top officials now opposing the death penalty. Death penalty opponents hope to place an initiative on the November ballot that would outlaw capital punishment. On the same ballot, supporters back a different initiative to speed up executions. “The people on death row, most of them have perpetrated grave crimes,” said Linda Fox, a board member of the group Death Penalty Focus, who spoke against the protocol. “But they are still human beings.” There was no proof, she argued, that using a barbiturate to carry out a death sentence would not result in a botched or painful execution. California juries have sentenced nearly 900 people to death since 1978, but only 13 have been executed. Sixty-eight have died of natural causes, 36 for other reasons. Of more than 750 inmates currently on death row, seven have been there since the 1970s. If the new protocol is adopted by corrections officials and voters do not outlaw the death penalty next November, the state could theoretically begin executing 18 prisoners who have exhausted their appeals. Legal challenges to the lethal injection drug, however, could drag on for years.",California lethal injection plan spurs capital punishment fight
"January 23, 2016 ","(Reuters) - Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has told his aides to draw up plans for an independent campaign for the U.S. presidency, according to a source familiar with the situation. Bloomberg has advised friends and associates that he would be willing to spend at least $1 billion of his own money on a campaign for the November 2016 election, according to the source, who spoke on condition on anonymity to discuss the former mayor’s thinking.  News of Bloomberg mulling a presidential run was first reported Saturday by the New York Times. Bloomberg, 73, has given himself an early March deadline for entering the race, the source said, after commissioning a poll in December to see how he would fare against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the Republican and Democratic frontrunners.  No third-party candidate has ever won a U.S. presidential election. But Bloomberg, who has close Wall Street ties and liberal social views, sees an opening for his candidacy if Republicans nominate Trump or Texas Senator Ted Cruz and the Democrats nominate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, the source said. Bloomberg, who has long privately flirted with the idea of mounting a presidential run, served as mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013. He switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent in 2007 and in recent years has spent millions on national campaigns to tighten U.S. gun laws and reform immigration. One unnamed Bloomberg adviser told the Times the former mayor believes voters want “a non-ideological, bipartisan, results-oriented vision” that has not been offered in the 2016 election cycle by either political party. A well-financed presidential run by Bloomberg would likely disrupt the dynamics of the election, but the billionaire would face significant hurdles in a race that has been in full swing for nearly a year. Though no third-party candidate has ever claimed the White House, several previous bids have affected the overall makeup of the race. In 1992 Texas businessman Ross Perot ran as an independent, a decision that some believe helped Democrat Bill Clinton defeat incumbent Republican George H. W. Bush. Bloomberg earned 13 percent support when facing a hypothetical three-way race against Clinton and Trump, according to a poll of 4,060 registered voters conducted January 14-17 by Morning Consult. Trump and Clinton were virtually tied at 37 and 36 percent, respectively, the survey found. Part of Bloomberg’s motivation to enter the race stems from a frustration with Clinton’s campaign, the source said. Clinton has been dogged by questions about her honesty amid an ongoing investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Sanders, Clinton’s chief rival, has recently surged in polling in key early voting states Iowa and New Hampshire. That development has made Bloomberg increasingly worried about a general election between Sanders, a self-described socialist, and Trump or Cruz, both of whom have staked out far-right positions on issues like immigration. At the New Hampshire Republican Party “First in the Nation Presidential Town Hall” in Nashua, Senator Rand Paul, who is lagging badly in opinion polls, seemed unfazed by the possibility of a Bloomberg third-party run. He even saw a bright side for his party. “If he splits the Democrat vote - those for gun control - that might be good for Republicans,” Paul told reporters. Representatives for Bloomberg declined to comment on the former mayor’s plans for the presidential race.

"January 24, 2016 ","DES MOINES, Iowa/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidates gave a cool reception on Sunday to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s potential independent White House run, with Bernie Sanders saying it would add another billionaire like Republican Donald Trump to the race. With eight days to go until Iowa holds the first nominating contest on the road to the Nov. 8 presidential election, Republican Senator Marco Rubio basked in the glow of an  endorsement from the Des Moines Register, the state’s biggest newspaper.  The weekend disclosure from a source close to the situation that Bloomberg is laying the groundwork for a run that he could launch should Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton falter, sent shock waves rippling through the entire presidential field. Sanders, a democratic socialist and Vermont senator who is threatening Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, told ABC’s “This Week” program that Bloomberg’s entry would add a second billionaire to the field. Trump, a real estate mogul, is leading the crowded Republican field. Sanders has railed against “millionaires and billionaires” and the political power they wield throughout his insurgent campaign for the Democratic nomination. “That is not what, to my view, American democracy is supposed to be about, a contest between billionaires. If that takes place, I am confident that we will win it,” Sanders said. Many analysts believe a Bloomberg entry into the race could siphon Democratic votes and be another blow to Clinton, a former secretary of state and the wife of former President Bill Clinton. An independent bid would be a heavy lift for Bloomberg. The last major third-party candidate, Ross Perot, won 18.9 percent of the vote in 1992, which some observers believe enabled Bill Clinton to defeat President George H.W. Bush. Hillary Clinton, who won the Register’s endorsement on the Democratic side on Saturday, said she expected to negate Bloomberg’s rationale for running. “He’s a good friend of mine and I am going to do the best I can that I get the nomination and we’ll go from there,” she told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “The way I read what he said is that if I didn’t get the nomination, he would do it. ... I will relieve him of that,” she said. Bloomberg, 73, a media magnate who has long privately flirted with the idea of a presidential run, served as mayor of New York from 2002 to 2013. He switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent in 2007 and has spent millions in recent years on national campaigns to tighten U.S. gun laws and reform immigration. Trump noted that he and Bloomberg had differences on the issues of gun control and abortion and that he would love to run against him. Bloomberg favors preserving a woman’s right to an abortion. “I know Michael very well and would love to compete with him. He is very opposite from me on guns and pro-life. ... I would love to have Michael get in the race,” Trump told CNN. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush told the ABC program that Bloomberg had been a “great mayor,” who was unlikely to get into the race unless Trump and Sanders were the parties’ nominees. “But that’s way off into the future,” Bush said. Rubio, at a town hall meeting in Marion, Iowa, brought up Bloomberg’s attempts for more gun control. He said he had been asked in a television interview to comment on Bloomberg’s potential candidacy. “I said he’s not a candidate. If he gets in, we’ll talk about his record and his hatred for the Second Amendment,” Rubio said, referring to the constitutional amendment granting Americans the right to bear arms. Bloomberg’s news service competes with Reuters.

"January 25, 2016 ","(Reuters) - Residents of New Jersey’s southern shorefront towns on Monday cleaned up homes and businesses flooded by a storm surge during the weekend’s massive blizzard and rued what they described as Governor Chris Christie’s dismissive treatment of the damage. The storm that walloped Washington and New York with about 2 feet (60 cm) of snow hit coastal Cape May County in New Jersey with tides higher than those measured during 2012’s Superstorm Sandy, sending salt water into properties and forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. Jim Hand voiced exasperation as he surveyed the damage at Fred’s Tavern in Stone Harbor, a bar and liquor store about 35 miles (56 km) down the coast from Atlantic City. Hand, a member of the third generation of his family to own the shop, said that the property’s kitchen, electrical wiring and floors would all need to be replaced. “We’re doing the same thing today we did after Sandy,” said Hand, 61. He was one of a handful of local business owners to criticize comments by Christie, a Republican White House contender who told CNN on Sunday that he had “no concerns” about flooding as a result of the storm.  “Keep this in perspective,” Christie told CNN during a one-day return to the state from the campaign trail in New Hampshire. “Cape May County area was the least flooded area during Hurricane Sandy and had almost no damage in that area.” No immediate estimate of the financial toll of the flooding damage was available but reinsurance broker Aon Benfield said that total insured losses along the East Coast will run into the billions of dollars.     Hand had no patience for Christie’s words, saying, “It shows you how out of touch he is with what’s going on in his state.” Angry comments from New Jersey residents immediately flashed across Twitter and raged into Monday, some showing images of street flooding and tagged to Christie with comments like “nothing to see here.”  Christie spokesman Brian Murray said that the governor’s words had been taken out of context. “Cape May County and lower Atlantic County did not sustain the direct hit from Sandy suffered by more northern parts of the Jersey Shore. But the governor did not say they were not impacted by Sandy,” Murray said. “He only cautioned news reporters to use some context when pointing to Saturday’s flooding in Cape May and saying it’s ‘Worse than Sandy.’” Sandy was directly responsible for 147 deaths in the United States, destroying more than 650,000 homes around the greater New York area and causing nearly $50 billion in damage. Christie said in a statement on Monday that he had sent teams to the storm-hit areas to determine whether the damage was  severe enough to seek federal assistance, a process that he said could take days. Children’s clothing store owner Maggie Day sprayed an anti-bacterial mix over her ruined merchandise as she surveyed the damage to her shop in Stone Harbor in Cape May County.    “I did walk away from Sandy with a lot of damage,” said Day, 39, who had to replace flooring, walls, insulation and merchandise after the 2012 storm and was working with a “water excavator” to get a handle on the latest damage. “It’s not even help that I’m asking for,” Day said. “It’s just a little bit of compassion with a public leader on TV. You can’t pooh-pooh it publicly when you’re a leader.”     ","In coastal New Jersey, a flood of criticism for Christie follows storm"
"January 26, 2016 ","(Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump won the endorsement on Tuesday of Joe Arpaio, the provocative Arizona sheriff known for his tough stance on illegal immigration. Arpaio joined the real estate billionaire in Marshalltown, Iowa, to voice his support before the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the Trump campaign said in a statement. The caucuses are the first contest in the nomination race for the Nov. 8 presidential election. “I have great respect for Sheriff Arpaio. We must restore law and order on the border and respect the men and women of our police forces. I thank him for his support of my policies and candidacy for president,” Trump said, according to the statement. “Donald Trump is a leader. He produces results and is ready to get tough in order to protect American jobs and families,” Arpaio was quoted as saying. “I have fought on the front lines to prevent illegal immigration. I know Donald Trump will stand with me and countless Americans to secure our border. I am proud to support him as the best candidate for president of the United States of America,” Arpaio added. Arpaio, 83, the sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, since 1993, has been found guilty of racial profiling in a federal court, and been accused of abuse of power, misuse of funds and unlawful enforcement of immigration laws. He bills himself as “America’s toughest sheriff.”  (Reporting by Eric Walsh in Washington; Editing by Peter Cooney) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",Trump wins endorsement from controversial Arizona lawman Arpaio
"January 27, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday escalated a fight with Fox News, using the word “bimbo” in a derogatory tweet about anchorwoman Megyn Kelly after pulling out of a debate only days before the first nominating contest of the 2016 campaign. Trump on Tuesday withdrew from the televised encounter, scheduled for Thursday night in Des Moines, Iowa, in irritation at host Fox News (FOXA.O) for allowing Kelly to moderate after her questioning angered him in a debate last year.     The real estate magnate, who is the Republican front-runner to win the nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, followed up with another round of insults on Wednesday. “I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct,” he wrote on Twitter. “Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!” In a later interview on Fox News’s “The O’Reilly Factor,” he told host Bill O’Reilly that she was “highly overrated.” “I have zero respect for Megyn Kelly. I don’t think she’s very good at what she does,” Trump said. Trump’s Republican presidential rivals were quick to criticize the former reality TV star, with U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blistering him in a series of tweets and accusing him of “trembling at being questioned by Kelly.” At an event in West Des Moines, Iowa, Cruz openly mocked Trump, calling him a “fragile soul” and “gentle,” and renewed his offer to debate Trump one-on-one Saturday evening. “It’s not that he’s afraid of me,” Cruz said to the crowd. “He’s afraid of you. He doesn’t want to answer questions from the men and women of Iowa about how his record doesn’t match what he’s selling.” Another Republican hopeful, U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, told Fox News that he welcomed Trump’s absence from the debate stage because it means “we don’t have to put up with a lot of empty blather and boastfulness and calling people names.” Trump’s decision means the last televised debate before Monday’s Iowa caucuses - which kick off the state-by-state nominating race to choose candidates for the presidential election - will not feature the man who has dominated the Republican race for months and leads many opinion polls. It was seen as a bold gamble. Trump has said that in lieu of his debate participation he will hold a fundraiser for veterans. It will be held at Drake University in Des Moines and begin at the same time Thursday as the Fox debate, according to an invitation his campaign circulated Wednesday evening.  “It’s a risky move; it’s very high profile,” said Craig Robinson, a former Iowa state party official. “But I’m not sure  it will really change anyone’s mind about Trump.”        Trump has been feuding with Fox News since the network hosted the first Republican debate in August, in which Kelly asked Trump about his treatment of women, prompting a stream of insults from the candidate and complaints he was not being treated fairly. He did not renew his attacks on Kelly during an evening rally in Gilbert, South Carolina, but told supporters to watch a rerun of the Fox interview, which he called a “tough interview,” when they got home. Cruz, Trump’s main rival in Iowa, used the hashtag #DuckingDonald to make fun of Trump for ducking out of the debate and tweeted a mocked-up picture of Trump’s head on Scrooge McDuck’s body sitting on a pile of money. Cruz, a conservative and a debating champion in college, tweeted a link to “duckingdonald.com,” which asked visitors to sign a petition in favor of Cruz and Trump having a side debate. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, another Republican presidential contender, described Trump’s decision at such a crucial time as “a big mistake” that calls into question his ability to be president. “Anytime you get a podium and a microphone and 15-20 million people watching in an election campaign, you should take it,” Christie told Boston Herald Radio. Another Republican candidate, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, said he wanted to focus on keeping the party united in order to beat Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, if she becomes the Democratic nominee. “These kinds of theatrics by Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are an entertaining sideshow, but they have nothing to do with defeating Hillary Clinton,” Rubio said. Not every candidate was convinced Trump would follow through on his pledge to stay away. “He apparently is not going to come to the debate, although I’ve got a $20 bet he’ll show up,” former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said at a town hall meeting in response to a question. “Poor little Donald, being treated unfairly,” he said. Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said Trump was not afraid to debate his rivals or take reporters’ questions. He added that Trump would be happy to debate Cruz if the contest, in which 12 Republicans are vying for their party’s nomination, narrows.  “If it comes down to a two-person race, Donald Trump would be happy to debate him,” Lewandowski told ABC’s “Good Morning America” program. Fox News, in a statement on Tuesday, said it would not “give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees,” but left the door open to Trump attending the debate. The event will be co-hosted by Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.              “At the end of the day, Mr. Trump is going to have the last laugh,” Lewandowski told MSNBC.

"January 28, 2016 ","DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - Even in boycotting a debate with his Republican rivals for the White House, front-runner Donald Trump managed to upstage the event on Thursday with a typical dramatic flourish. Instead of attending a seventh debate, the former reality TV star held a competing event across town that he said raised $6 million for U.S. military veterans. In doing so, he cast a shadow over his rivals, who frequently tossed barbs his way. Trump’s gamble that he could leave the battlefield to his rivals for one night appeared to pay off, with just days to go before Iowa holds the first nominating contest of the 2016 election season. No one appeared to emerge as a central challenger to him during the two-hour face-off in Des Moines. Trump’s refusal to participate in the debate out of anger that Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly was a moderator prompted a flurry of last-minute phone calls with Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes that failed to resolve their dispute. A Fox News (FOXA.O) statement said Trump requested that Fox contribute $5 million to his charities in exchange for his attendance, which the network turned down. The debate was the type of event Republicans would routinely have without the flamboyant Trump on stage, and it lacked the electricity that he brings to the party’s search for a nominee for the Nov. 8 election. Without Trump on stage, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie found themselves with more room to make their case to voters seeking a more mainstream candidate.      Both men have an eye on the Feb. 9 first-in-the-nation primary in New Hampshire, which comes on the heels of the Iowa  caucuses on Monday and where an establishment Republican like them might have a better chance of standing out. Senator Ted Cruz from Texas and Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, the two top challengers to Trump in Iowa, engaged in squabbles over immigration and national security and did not appear to threaten Trump’s lead. He holds the edge over Cruz in polls of Iowa Republicans. Trump’s rivals mocked his decision to sit out the debate and found ways to criticize him. “I’m a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat and ugly, and Ben, you’re a terrible surgeon,” Cruz told his rivals, including Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, as the debate opened. His next sentence began: “Now that we’ve gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way.” Bush, who has been a frequent target of Trump’s attacks, turned a question about religious tolerance into an attack on Trump’s proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. “Donald Trump, for example — I mentioned his name again if anybody was missing him — Mr. Trump believed in reaction to people’s fears that we should ban all Muslims. Well, that creates an environment that’s toxic in our own country,” Bush said. Cruz, after a series of questions, said: “If you ask me one more mean question, I may have to leave the stage.” In a swipe at both Trump and Cruz, Rubio chimed in: “Don’t worry, I’m not going to leave the stage no matter what you ask me.” With his veterans’ event drawing live TV news coverage on Fox News competitors CNN and MSNBC, Trump had plenty of media attention. He clung to his insistence that Fox News had treated him badly. He has complained that Kelly insulted him at a debate in August and that a statement from the network earlier this week  belittled him. Two other Republican candidates, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee, joined Trump on stage after participating in a debate of low-polling candidates. Not so former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore. “I’m not about to go across town tonight to carry the coat for some billionaire,” he said at the “undercard” debate. There was initially some mystery as to which veterans' groups would receive the money raised at the event, which included $1 million from Trump himself. His campaign, in a statement, said the funds would go to 22 different groups it listed online (bit.ly/1OTKtuJ).   Trump, with just one day’s notice on a weeknight, was able to fill to capacity a Drake University hall that holds 700. “I didn’t want to be here, to be honest, I wanted to be about five minutes away” at the debate, Trump told the crowd. “When you’re treated badly, you have to stick up for your rights - whether we like it or not.” Trump dominated social media during the debate, leading the entire Republican pack in Twitter mentions throughout the first half of the debate, according to data from social media analytics firm Zoomph. He was by far the most-searched-for candidate on Google during the first half of the debate, at one point outpacing the second-most-searched-for candidate, Rubio, by nearly four-to-one, according to Google Trends data. Trump’s support in opinion polls, much of it from blue-collar men, has not wavered for months despite him insulting Mexican immigrants and Muslims and clashing with Republican establishment figures like Senator John McCain.

"January 29, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department conceded for the first time on Friday that intelligence officials were correct to say that at least 22 emails sent through Hillary Clinton’s private server contain some of the government’s most sensitive secrets. The seven email chains from Clinton’s time as secretary of state, amounting to 22 separate messages, will be withheld from the public as a result because the information in them is classified at the highest level as “top secret,” State Department spokesman John Kirby said. The announcement came three days before the Iowa caucuses, when the first votes are cast for the presidential nominations and where Clinton is locked in a tight race with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to become the Democratic nominee for the November election. “These documents were not marked classified at the time that they were sent,” Kirby said. He added that the department was now investigating whether the information in them was classified at the time it passed through her private clintonemail.com email account run on a server in her New York home. The department and intelligence officials have been arguing about the emails, which are being made public under a federal court order, for at least five months. The State Department initially maintained that Clinton might have obtained the same information independently through non-classified channels. The decision to no longer pursue this argument will add to the questions Clinton has faced for months over her handling of sensitive government information as she seeks to maintain her position as the favorite to become the Democratic nominee. The Clinton campaign criticized the State Department’s decision as the result of “bureaucratic infighting” and “over-classification run amok,” adding that the emails should be released. Some information has been censored in more than 1,300 emails already made public because the State Department says it is classified, including the privately shared thoughts of foreign leaders and government officials. But this is the first time that entire chains are being withheld. Congressional Republicans have criticized and investigated Clinton for her use of a private email server for her work as a secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Some of her Republican rivals for the presidency, including New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, have called for her prosecution. Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee’s chairman, said in a statement that Clinton had “put our national security and diplomatic efforts at risk.” The government forbids handling of classified information, which may or may not be marked that way, outside secure government-controlled channels, and sometimes prosecutes people who remove it from such channels. The government classifies information as top secret if it deems a leak could cause “exceptionally grave damage” to national security.  U.S. Representative Adam Schiff of California, the House Intelligence Committee’s leading Democrat, defended Clinton in a statement, saying classification determinations are “often very complex” and she was “responding to world events in real time without the benefit of months of analysis after the fact.” The Federal Bureau of Investigation has taken Clinton’s server and other computer equipment, but has declined to share details of its inquiries. White House spokesman Josh Earnest downplayed questions about whether Clinton might be prosecuted by the Justice Department. “That’s not something I’m worried about,” he told reporters. Clinton initially said she never sent or received classified information through her email. In recent weeks she has more often said none of her emails were marked that way.  Following a court-ordered schedule, the State Department has already released most of the roughly 30,000 work emails Clinton returned to the department.  The department had been ordered to release all the emails by Friday, but last week asked the court for a one-month extension. The State Department also said it would agree with a request from the White House that Clinton’s emails with President Barack Obama, 18 in all, be withheld from public release for several years under the Presidential Records Act.

"January 30, 2016 ","DES MOINES, Iowa/COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (Reuters) - Republicans Donald Trump and Ted Cruz battled on Sunday to persuade their supporters to turn out and tried to lower expectations on how well they will do in the first U.S. presidential nominating contest in Iowa on Monday. Iowa will set the tone in the race for the Nov. 8 election, offering the first measure of the strength of outsider candidates like billionaire businessman Trump and democratic socialist Bernie Sanders against more traditional politicians like Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. The day before Iowa’s caucuses, Trump and Cruz, a senator from Texas and conservative Tea Party favorite, reflected anxiety about the unpredictability of the race in the Midwestern state as they and other candidates made their final pitches at rallies across Iowa. A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg News poll of Iowa voters released on Saturday showed Trump in the lead among Republicans with 28 percent, Cruz second at 23 percent and Rubio in third with 15 percent. In rallies in Council Bluffs and Sioux City, Trump displayed a more low-key style than his usual flame-throwing flourishes in an apparent bid to appeal to Iowa religious conservatives who have for the most part backed Cruz. Trump, sitting on stage, was asked friendly questions by religious leader Jerry Falwell Jr., who portrayed Trump as a family man and supporter of Christian charities who served cheeseburgers instead of caviar on his plane. In Council Bluffs earlier, Trump brought his wife and daughter on stage and implored Republicans to pick him, noting that Iowa’s 2008 winner, Mike Huckabee, and 2012 victor Rick Santorum both ultimately failed to win the Republican nomination. “You have a lousy record - 16 years you haven’t picked a winner. Please pick a winner this time,” he said.  In Iowa City, Cruz urged about 500 supporters crammed into a building at the county fairgrounds to turn out for the caucuses if they wanted to help him break the cycle of politics as usual in Washington. “Join us, commit tomorrow night to come out and caucus for us. Stand up and speak for us. If we stand together, we will win,” he said.  TOSS-UP? Among Democrats, Clinton, a former secretary of state, senator and first lady, clung to a narrow 45 percent to 42 percent lead over Sanders, putting the senator from Vermont in position for a potential upset win that would be a harsh blow to Clinton. In Marshalltown, Iowa, Sanders called the race basically a toss-up. “My prediction is that if tomorrow night there is a large voter turnout, we win,” Sanders said. “On the other hand, if there is a low voter turnout, we’ll probably lose.” Although Clinton spent much of her time at a rally in Council Bluffs contrasting her vision with those of the Republican candidates, she said that while she and Sanders shared the goal of achieving universal healthcare, he had a “different view” of how to accomplish it. Sanders backs a single-payer system paid for by higher taxes, while Clinton would build on President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. The Sanders and Clinton campaigns have been squabbling over adding more debates to the relatively skimpy schedule of six debates organized by the Democratic National Committee. MNSBC said on Sunday both candidates had agreed to join former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley at a previously announced debate in New Hampshire on Thursday. The central mystery about Trump’s campaign in Iowa has been whether the real estate mogul and former reality TV star can convert voter enthusiasm for his candidacy into actual turnout at the caucuses. Trump, who has never sat through a nerve-wracking night of vote counting, was not predicting victory in Iowa in interviews and stump speeches on Sunday. “No, I don’t have to win it,” he told CBS’ “Face the Nation” when asked whether he needed to win Iowa. “But I think it would be really good to win Iowa.” Cruz, who saw his lead in the state overtaken by Trump but may have a stronger turnout operation, also tried to lower expectations. “No, we don’t view any state as a must-win,” Cruz told CNN. “We are positioned to do very well.” Ten Republicans and three Democrats are campaigning in Iowa for their parties’ nominations, but much of the focus has been on the fight between Cruz and Trump and their uneasy relationship with the Republican establishment. Trump described Cruz as a “nasty guy” who had not scored key  endorsements in the Senate, and would have trouble leading change in Washington. “Nobody likes him,” Trump told ABC’s “This Week.”   Cruz attacked Trump on CNN’s “State of the Union,” calling Trump’s refusal to appear onstage at Thursday’s Republican debate in Des Moines “a real mistake,” and likening Trump’s views to those of Democratic President Barack Obama and Sanders.

"January 31, 2016 ","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The millions of Twitter users following Donald Trump shouldn’t expect a “follow back” from the Republican presidential front-runner anytime soon.  Trump’s campaign account @realDonaldTrump has nearly 6 million Twitter followers, the most of any candidate running for president. But he is picky about who he follows, with just 49 accounts listed as of Friday. That means he has the highest ratio of followers to those he is following, in both the Republican and Democratic fields.  In contrast, Ted Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas who has emerged as Trump’s strongest rival, follows nearly 14,000 accounts on Twitter and has 755,000 followers, according to his profile as of Friday. The exclusivity underscores how Trump primarily uses Twitter to broadcast his message as opposed to engaging in a back and forth with users, experts in digital strategy said. While other campaigns use a similar approach, Trump commands the most attention on social media. Trump’s pickiness may indicate a surprising strategy for the freewheeling Republican front-runner: Playing it safe when it comes to pledging his Twitter allegiance with a “follow.”  Candidates can’t pick and choose their followers, but they have control over when to click the follow button. “There is more risk in who you follow,” said Scott Talan, a communications professor at American University who teaches social media strategy. “If you’re actively following someone, you’re assuming it’s not going to be some religious extremist ... or a prisoner with a record.” And, while some Republican candidates follow each other, Trump follows none of them.  The accounts Trump monitors include those of his children and several hotel properties. Also on the eclectic list are musician Steven Tyler, basketball great Magic Johnson, Vince McMahon, chairman and CEO of WWE Inc, and sisters Lynette “Diamond” Hardaway and Rochelle “Silk” Richardson, former Democrats who now stump for Trump and tweet under the handle @DiamondandSilk. Despite Trump’s highly public battle with Fox News over anchor Megyn Kelly’s role as a moderator in last week’s Republican debate, Fox shows or news personalities such as Sean Hannity account for better than 10 percent of the handles he follows. Kelly, not surprisingly, did not make the list, but the Fox handles still add up to a larger bloc than any outside of Trump’s family or business. Hannity and other Fox presenters are also widely followed by Trump’s rivals for the GOP presidential nomination. Trump’s cautious approach to who he follows hasn’t put a damper on his social activity. His account shows more than 30,000 tweets, the highest of any account reviewed by Reuters.  It also hasn’t stopped Trump from committing blunders with his retweets, like the one from an account called @WhiteGenocideTM, which gave its location as “Jewmerica” and featured an image that referenced George Lincoln Rockwell, a prominent figure in the neo-Nazi movement in the United States. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said that Trump operates his own Twitter account. “Everything you see on there is pretty much directly from him,” she said. “The strategy behind it is to tell the truth and to call it like he sees it.” On Twitter, Trump goes where his opponents fear to tread. He uses it to launch unfiltered personal attacks on those who cross paths with him. For example, he did not shy from retweeting a post that included photographs of a skimpily dressed Kelly from a magazine shoot and the comment, “And this is the bimbo that’s asking presidential questions?” “He is definitely a loose cannon in terms of how he uses his Twitter account,” said Micah Sifry, co-founder of Personal Democracy Media, an online forum on technology and politics. “At the same time, he hasn’t been hurt by it yet because apparently a big chunk of what he’s saying is popular among Republican voters.”  Trump is aware of his social media success. Following the seventh Republican presidential debate on Thursday, he tweeted Twitter data showing that he commanded the most traffic during the event. “Great Twitter poll-and I wasn’t even there,” he said. Twitter matters to campaigns - it is an increasingly important way for candidates to reach their most ardent supporters.  But talking about the issues on Twitter may not always be the most effective means of engaging supporters. A recent Trump tweet wishing retired golfer Jack Nicklaus happy birthday received more than four thousand “likes”, roughly twice as many as Clinton’s policy-related tweets on the same day.

"Jul 1, 2016","Is it possible that Bill s latest move could ve just sealed Hillary s fate? It actually makes perfect sense. Bill and Hillary Clinton have spent their entire lives trying to figure out how to game the system. Is it possible that Bill has actually  one-upped  Hillary this time, putting the kibosh on her political aspirations, leaving him with millions from her Wall Street speeches and their home in Chappaqua, New York; minus his cantankerous, scheming,  lying, screeching and (according to former secret service agents) sometimes violent wife?Back in April, Slate s Michelle Goldberg offered the Hillary Clinton campaign some sage advice:  Fire Bill Clinton. The Clinton campaign declined to take her suggestion, but perhaps they should give it another look.Bill Clinton is one of the most talented politicians of the past century, but his infallible skills continue to fail him when put in the service of someone other than himself.On Monday, Clinton was on a tarmac in Phoenix when he learned that the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, would soon be on the same tarmac. He delayed his flight so he could try to meet with her. He asked for a meeting, boarded her plane and chatted for about 30 minutes.On Friday, MSNBC s Jonathan Capehart asked Lynch if there was one important thing she wished former Attorney General Eric Holder had told her.  Where the lock on the plane door was,  Lynch deadpanned.(Meanwhile, Republicans are calling for an independent prosecutor, which is rich: there isn t enough time to confirm a Supreme Court justice, but plenty of time for Ken Starr to ride into town again.)On its face, it was wrong to do, and Democrats would be savaging Republicans if the situation were reversed. It raises one of two possibilities: Either Bill Clinton is an idiot or he wants his wife to lose. I wonder if there s a part of Bill Clinton that doesn t really want Hillary Clinton to become president, particularly if she has to distance herself from his legacy to do so,  wondered Goldberg back in April, listing a bill of idiotic particulars.  How else to explain why one of the world s most talented and agile politicians is so consistently flat-footed and destructive when advocating on his wife s behalf? The fallout from the meeting was predictable: Lynch has said she regrets sitting down with Clinton and wouldn t do it again, given a do-over. And she has said that she will not overrule career prosecutors if they recommend an indictment. Whatever decision the Justice Department ends up making is now clouded in (even more) suspicion.And perhaps the greatest damage was done to Lynch. It must be awfully difficult to turn down a meeting request from a former president, the spouse of the likely future president, especially for somebody who may have future political ambitions. Did Lynch have aspirations for the Supreme Court? If so, what Clinton just did casts a pall over whatever chance she had.Via:  Huffington Post","LIBERAL HUFFINGTON POST HEADLINE: “Man, Bill Clinton Is An Idiot”…Is Bill Intentionally Trying To Put Hillary Behind Bars?"

"Jul 12, 2016","Obama had the audacity to tell this crowd of mourners that he wonders  if the divides of race in America can ever be bridged?  He must have forgotten who created and cultivated the racial divide with his good friends Eric Holder and Al Sharpton None of us is entirely innocent And that includes our police departments It started out well, with Obama calling the shooting  racial hatred , but then descended quickly into a lecture to the police about their bigotry and need to recognize the pain Black Lives Matter folks feel. He even brought up slavery, Jim Crow and  history of oppression . It was about salving his own issues, as always, not recognizing the event he was at, a memorial for the five officers. He did mention them, but spent most of the time imploring people to recognize their racism.   Weasel ZippersPresident Obama defended the Black Lives Matter movement Tuesday at a memorial service for five slain Dallas police officers, saying bigotry remains in police departments across the U.S. While paying tribute to the fallen officers for sacrificing their lives to protect others from a sniper, Mr. Obama also called on law enforcement agencies to root out bigotry. We have all seen this bigotry in our lives at some point,  Mr. Obama told an audience of several hundred at a concert hall in Dallas. None of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune. And that includes our police departments. We know this.  The officers   Michael Smith, Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Brent Thompson and Patrick Zamarripa   were killed by a black sniper who told police he targeted white officers during a Black Lives Matter protest Thursday night.At the service, photographs of the slain officers were displayed on the stage. Five empty seats in the arena were adorned with folded U.S. flags and duty-officer hats to signify their loss.The president, who has been criticized by law-enforcement officials for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, said Americans  cannot simply turn away and dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers or paranoid. We can t simply dismiss it as a symptom of political correctness or reverse racism,  he said.HERE is part of Obama s embarrassing speech. The speech in its entirety can be found below:Former President George W. Bush, a resident of the Dallas area, said the nation is proud of the slain officers. Our police chief and police department have been mighty inspirations for the rest of the nation,  Mr. Bush said.  These slain officers were the best among us. Referring to racial divisions roiling the country, Mr. Bush said Americans must work at  finding our better selves. We recognize that we are brothers and sisters, sharing the same brief moment on earth,  Mr. Bush said.  We do not want the unity of grief, nor do we want the unity of fear. We want the unity of hope, affection and high purpose. Mr. Obama said the gunman, Army veteran Micah X. Johnson, committed  an act not just of demented violence, but of racial hatred. It s as if the deepest fault lines of our democracy have been exposed, perhaps even widened,  the president said.  We wonder if the divides of race in America can ever be bridged.

"Jul 14, 2015","Last we checked harvesting and selling body parts in America was illegal. Perhaps the abortion industry has some sort of special exception since killing babies is such an important service to Americans In the gruesome and now viral video that shows a Planned Parenthood medical officer talking to undercover actors posing as biotech entrepreneurs about the prospects of buying fetal body parts, the name of one company pops up several times:In the context of selling aborted fetal tissue, Dr. Deborah Nucatola is seen and heard discussing her ongoing relationship with a company called StemExpress that works as the middleman between Planned Parenthood affiliates and research institutes that use the body parts in scientific experimentation.The video, provided by the pro-life group Center for Medical Progress, purports to show an actual online order form from StemExpress where buyers can order the parts they want and the age of gestation.The pull down menu shows  brain, heart, heart (veins and arteries attached), lungs, liver, liver and thymus, spleen, large intestine  and so on. The order form allows the buyer to choose the gestational age of the baby to be aborted from four weeks upward.StemExpress is a five-year old privately held for-profit business located in Placerville, California that describes itself as  a multi-million dollar company that supplies human blood, tissue products, primary cells and other clinical specimens to biomedical researchers.  The company says it  offers the largest variety of raw material in the industry, as well as fresh, fixed and cryopreserved human primary cells. StemExpress calls itself as  the only company of its kind to both procure tissues and isolate cells for researchers  individual needs in its own labs. Our human tissue products range from fetal to adult and healthy to diseased, and we also collect bone marrow and leukapheresis for isolation.  StemExpress promises that by partnering with them  you ll get the high quality samples you need so that you can focus on the research. Some will wonder how something that is apparently illegal goes on so openly. David Daleiden of the Center for Medical Progress told Breitbart News,  It is the Kermit Gosnell effect. There is simply a lack of interest in enforcing this kind of law because of abortion. On the video Nucatola is heard talking about pricing, that  specimens  would range from $30 to $100. It is expected that Planned Parenthood will claim these charges are merely for their services and do not include a profit. Daleiden told Breitbart News that there are no extra services because companies like StemExpress are there at the facility to harvest the organs on order and walk out with them, not even shipping charges.Daleiden said that while the practice goes on around the country, it is especially hard to prosecute in California because of the political power of the abortion industry.The buying and selling of human body parts is illegal under the U.S. Criminal Code though companies can charge for expenses. The question becomes how a  multi-million dollar  for-profit company buys fetal body parts and sells them but makes no profit.Repeated calls to StemExpress for a comment have gone unreturned.

During the bank s annual meeting in May, 2016, Dimon reportedly commented on what he thinks the government should work on:Dimon emphasized the areas he believes are in serious need of fixing, including education, infrastructure, and tax reform. Our corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas and excessive regulation is reducing growth and business formation particularly for small businesses. THE STUPID SH*T WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN THIS COUNTRY It s almost embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country,  Dimon said in response to an analyst question. Since the Great Recession, which is now 8 years old, we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2 percent in spite of stupidity and political gridlock, because the American business sector is powerful and strong,  he said.  What I m saying is that it would be much stronger growth if there were more intelligent decisions and less gridlock. The executive of the U.S. banking giant cited travels to countries such as France, Argentina, Israel and Ireland. The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet  and  it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies,  he said.JPMorgan Chase reported earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates Friday.

The Senate cut short its August recess by two weeks in order to deal with health care. There are about a dozen Senators opposed to the current bill citing the possibility that this new health care bill is  Obamacare lite . Senator Rand Paul has voiced strong opposition to this new bill.Here s the transcript from Dimon:Since the Great Recession which is now eight years old we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2% despite the stupidity and political gridlock. Because the American business sector is powerful and strong and is going to grow regardless of they went to feed their kids and want to buy home they want to do things the same as American businesses what I m saying is it would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and that gridlock, and thank you for pointing it out because I m going to be a broken record until this gets done, we are unable to build bridges, unable to build airports, not graduating.I was just in France, in Argentina, Israel, Ireland we met with the Prime Minister of India and China it s amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies to promote business growth is good for the average citizens of those countries for jobs and wages and somehow this great American free enterprise system we no longer get it.My view is corporate taxation is critical to that by the way regarding capital brings overseas, which is why the $2 trillion overseas benefiting all these other countries don t like that, so if we don t get our act together we can still grow. It s just unfortunate but it s hurting us, it s hurting the body politic, it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies. So no in spite of gridlock we will grow at 1   or 2%.I don t buy the argument that we are relegated to this effort.

Millions of people head to local mosques for special Eid prayers followed by festive gatherings, gift exchanges, and feasts among friends, neighbors and families. The diversity of traditions paint the vibrant images we see from around the world capturing the spirit and excitement of Eid   colorful dresses or white garments decorating the masses of people standing in lines for prayer, lanterns and ornaments lighting up bazaars and neighborhoods, intricate henna designs painted on hands of young girls and women, and an abundance of delectable foods and aromatic cuisines. As Muslim Americans celebrate Eid across America, the holiday is a reminder to every American of the importance of respecting those of all faiths and beliefs. This past year New York City Public Schools announced adding Eid to their official school calendars alongside Christmas, Hanukkah and other holidays   an acknowledgement of the great diversity and inclusiveness that adds to the richness of our nation. During this year s White House Iftar, I had the opportunity to meet inspiring young Muslim Americans who are leading efforts for greater understanding and unity across diverse communities. Following the Iftar, one of the young attendees helped spearhead an effort that raised more than $75,000 for the churches burned in the wake of the shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Americans of all faiths and beliefs must stand together to protect our democracy and strengthen our country as a whole. Michelle and I hope today brings joy to all of your homes, both here in the U.S. and around the world.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Saturday turned her fire on the newly minted GOP presidential ticket, calling Donald Trump and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence  two small, insecure, weak men. She said Pence  is famous for trying to control women s bodies,  and that the two Republicans   sexism  is  in line with the party platform. Warren s tweetstorm came just minutes ahead of the scheduled joint appearance where Trump will introduce Pence as his running mate.Warren is reportedly on the shortlist to be Hillary Clinton s running mate.

"Jul 17, 2015","Just confirming what anyone paying attention already knew. The Huffington Post isn t interested in reporting the news they re strictly serving as a propaganda arm of the progressive left Earlier this month, while political news organizations were wrestling with the rise of Donald Trump, Washington Post senior politics editor Steven Ginsberg offered a philosophy:  In my view, making decisions solely according to who may win the nomination is the worst way to cover a presidential election,  he said.  A whole lot happens on the way to the nomination and you can t explain what s happening with the candidates or the country without being on top of all of it. Since then, Trump s influence in the Republican primary has only grown. He has surged to the front of the pack, leading his rivals by 3 points in the most recent Fox News and USA Today/Suffolk polls, respectively. He has raised issues that have resonated with conservative voters and forced other GOP candidates to come forward on where they stand. It is very likely that he will appear near center-stage at the inaugural Republican debate, on Aug. 6, and lead the pile-on against Jeb Bush.In other words, Trump is a major character in this chapter of the 2016 presidential election story. And as Ginsberg said,  you can t explain what s happening with the candidates or the country without being on top of all of it. On Friday, however, the Huffington Post s politics team announced that they would no longer cover the candidate as a political story. After watching and listening to Donald Trump since he announced his candidacy for president, we have decided we won t report on Trump s campaign as part of The Huffington Post s political coverage. Instead, we will cover his campaign as part of our Entertainment section,  they wrote.  Our reason is simple: Trump s campaign is a sideshow. We won t take the bait. If you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you ll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette. A quick fact-check: 1. Huffington Post is taking the bait, because they re continuing to cover Trump and will continue to benefit from the clicks. 2. Trump s campaign isn t a sideshow. He s leading the field, and is therefore a daily preoccupation for other candidates. (Hours after posting its note, Huffington Post sent an email clarifying that  the impact [Trump is] having on the Republican Party and the immigration debate is itself a real thing,  which it will cover  as substance, but anything that tumbles out of his mouth will land on the Entertainment page. )One might conclude that Huffington Post s announcement amounts to the same Trump-style grandstanding they claim to condemn. On a larger level, they seem to miss the point that all politics is theater. Countless statements have tumbled forth from the mouth of candidates   top-tier and third-tier   that were made precisely to rile up the base, bait an opponent, get free play in the media, etc. The Huffington Post politics team has covered these stories, and will almost surely continue to do so   even when they come from candidates who have a less of a shot at their party s nomination than Trump.Via: Politico",HUFFING TON POST WON’T COVER REPUBLICAN FRONTRUNNER DONALD TRUMP’S CAMPAIGN
"Jul 17, 2016","This cop killer was a hateful, racist sub-human. He not only hated white people and cops, he bragged about it. The scary thing is, much like ISIS, who has no trouble recruiting people with hate in their hearts, there are no shortage of people to carry out Obama s war on cops in America. These are terrorists and our very own  President  has inspired these people to act on their hate for Whites, for cops and for America. This, is Obama s real legacy The 29 year old ex-marine, Gavin Eugene Long, who ambushed and killed three unsuspecting Baton Rouge police officers on Sunday morning, hated those who did not share his skin-tone and harbored a particular hatred for the police. As revealed in the hours after the shootings, a Youtube account operated by Long under the handle I Am Cosmo where the alleged killer posted dozens of clips, provides insight into what motivated the young man to kill three police officers and wound three more on his 29th birthday.In the Youtube videos, Long rants against  crackers, and makes multiple references to the July 5th killing of Alton Sterling at the hands of police officers only five miles away from Sunday s attack. The videos also detail that Long is a member of the Nation of Islam, labelled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for its black supremacist and racist views towards Jews, Asians, and whites which the group s leaders argue have  sucked the blood from and exploited the black community.As Daily Caller details, the 29-year-old was a native of Kansas City, Missouri and was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2010 after reaching the rank of E-5. He preferred to go by the name Cosmo Ausar Setepenra rather than Gavin Eugene Long.In a video published on Thursday, the racist shooter says that  If I would have been there with Alton   Clap  before promoting a book that he wrote that discusses black liberation ideology.  I wrote it for my dark-skinned brothers,  said Long.  If you look at all the rebels like Black Panthers, Huey P. Newton, Malcolm X, and Elijah Muhammad, they was light-skinned. But we know how hard y all got it. https://youtu.be/kGuUq6eUoFwThe assailant also suggested that the black community should buy only from black-owned businesses rather than  working for the white people. In one video Long is heard lamented  working for the white people.  He encouraged one man riding in his vehicle as he filmed using a body camera to shop only at black-owned businesses. He brought up a hypothetical scenario in which a family member who wanted to buy carpet was forced to buy from non-black business owners saying    Who s she going to f  with? The cracker, the Arab, the Chinese? These Arabs, these Indians, they don t give two fucks about us,  said the shooter.Come to think of it, he may have a point.

We ll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us.  Why it matters: Trump is acknowledging defeat and now, rather than support Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s push to repeal with out a replacement bill, he s decided to let Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act remain the law of the land. fast forward and McConnell s straight repeal plan collapses with 3  no votes.  The three no votes came from three women who should really be in the D column: By Tuesday afternoon, three Republican senators   all women   had come out against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s plan to push a vote on a clean Obamacare repeal bill   enough to sink it altogether. Sens.

We thought they were in fairly good shape. For 7 years I ve been hearing repeal and replace  and when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace, we can t. We are winning the war on the border, we re decimating ISIS  we ve had a lot of victories but we haven t had a victory on health care. I m very disappointed.

More Americans need to take a stand against anyone who attempts to silence their First Amendment right Whenever folks in Penfield, New York get a hankering for pancakes for lunch   they head over to the 5 Mile Caf .The family-owned restaurant is known in those parts for serving breakfast any time of the day (order their homemade corned beef hash).They are also known for their patriotism. We are very patriotic here at the caf    all year round  not just this time of year,  owner Jennifer Aquino told me.  We have American flags and patriotic things around the caf . So Jennifer decided to ask the town for a permit so she could post a  God Bless America  banner on the front of her restaurant. She wanted to display the banner from Memorial Day through Independence Day.There was just one significant problem.Penfield has a strict banner allotment policy. Businesses are only allowed to post banners for a total of three weeks out of the year. And Jennifer had used up her allotment. At one point we had banners all over the town and the town just looked trashy and our residents said enough s enough,  town supervisor Tony LaFountain told WHEC.Jennifer s request was denied.Instead of posting the banner outside the restaurant, she posted it inside. And that was that   until the Orlando terrorist attack. I decided on my way to work that I was going to put it up regardless of the town telling me I couldn t,  she said.  So I put it up. A bit later that day she received an email from the town telling her to remove the banner. They warned her that she could face a possible fine for violating the ordinance. I didn t take it down,  Jennifer told me.  And I was willing to pay the fine. The [message on the banner] means a lot to me   especially during this time in our country with all that s going on with terrorism,  she said.  I just can t believe that I can t have this banner up and be supported by the town board. The fact that I m being asked to take it down is wrong,  she said.  It s against my First Amendment rights. People need to open up their eyes. If we start letting them tell us we can t do this   it s going to get worse. Jennifer tells me she never imagined there would be a day like this in America.

The White House released the report of Trump s staffers  salaries in a 16-page report on Friday, resulting in projected four-year savings of more than $22 million.

But one photo emerges that defies Barack and Michelle Obama s hateful and divisive narrative.In the latest chapter of the outcry over the Confederate flag issue in South Carolina, an unexpected scene emerged from rallies involving the Ku Klux Klan and black supporters this weekend   a photo of a black police officer helping a white supremacist at the Capitol in Charleston.Members of the Loyal White Knights of the KKK were protesting the state s recent decision to remove the flag from the statehouse grounds. Black advocates held their own rally, and a clash among the two parties ensued.IN THE MIDST OF SO MUCH HATE, ONE HOPEFUL PHOTO EMERGED: It didn t take long for the photograph   taken by Rob Godfrey, the deputy chief of staff for South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley   to spread on the Internet. Not an uncommon example of humanity in SC: Leroy Smith helps white supremacist to shelter & water as heat bears down,  Godfrey wrote in posting the photo on Twitter.Officer Leroy Smith was helping the man find shade and water on a hot day in Charleston, when temperatures reached the upper 90s. About 2,000 people attended the rallies. He was assisting with crowd control on the stairs where the KKK was rallying,  spokeswoman Sherri Iacobelli said of Smith.As might be expected, the general public largely fell into one of two camps   applauding the photo, or questioning it. This kindness chokes me up. How do SC people find that well of caring in the midst of so much hatred?  one person replied in the photo s comment thread. Amazing! I couldn t find it in my heart and I am white,  another remarked. Just curious. Put this in reverse.

"Jul 21, 2015","Obama s ICE Director Sarah Saldana is not the only one determined to help Obama fundamentally transform America. In 2013, Border Agents pleaded with Congress to not pass the  Gang of Eight  bill. They warned that passing it would make America less safe. ICE Agents warned:The 1,200 page substitute bill before the Senate will provide instant legalization and a path to citizenship to gang members and other dangerous criminal aliens, and handcuff ICE officers from enforcing immigration laws in the future. It provides no means of effectively enforcing visa overstays which account for almost half of the nation s illegal immigration crisis.WE WERE WARNEDU.S. Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, voiced his objections to Sarah Saldana s nomination in 2014 when he submitted the following remarks for the Congressional record on the nomination of Sarah Saldana as Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE): Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the nomination of Sarah Saldana. Ms. Salda a has been nominated to head the nation s top immigration law enforcement agency, which has been at the epicenter of this administration s refusal to enforce our nation s immigration laws.When asked whether she rejects the President s unlawful action to unilaterally grant legal residence and work permits to 5 million individuals illegally in the country, Ms. Salda a, currently the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, responded  no.  Her answer reflects a remarkable disregard for the rule of law that demonstrates that, if confirmed, she will continue the pattern of lawlessness perpetuated by the President and the political leadership of the Department of Homeland Security.Breitbart News- President Obama s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director tells lawmakers that no consequences are planned for sanctuary cities until Congress first passes  comprehensive immigration reform.  Sarah Salda a testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on criminal alien violence.After hearing emotional testimony from families torn apart by illegal immigrant murderers, Republican members of Congress grilled two administration witnesses: Leon Rodriquez, Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and Sarah Salda a, Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Both Rodriquez and Salda a have been tasked with carrying out President Obama s executive amnesty for so-called DREAMers, which includes work permits and medical benefits for low-income illegal aliens funded by citizen taxpayers.Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) repeatedly pressed Salda a on why the Administration was taking no action against sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to turn over dangerous criminal aliens from their prisons and jails to federal law officers. Salda a replied that Congress would first have to pass  comprehensive immigration reform. Vitter:  This has been going on for years and you still are not prepared to say that there is ever going to be any negative consequence to those [sanctuary] jurisdictions. When is that going to change? Salda a:  I presume when you all address comprehensive immigration reform; perhaps it can be addressed there. Vitter described Salda a s answer as  ridiculous  and kept pressing:  And absent Congress passing that [Senate immigration] bill, that you and the Obama Administration prefer, you don t think right now we can stop sanctuary cities from flaunting federal law? You don t think right now there can be any negative consequences when they do not properly cooperate under existing federal law with immigration enforcement? Salda a gave a muddled reply:  That s what I understand that all of you are working on. Ironically, an immigration bill pushed by Senators Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) would have given amnesty to many of the criminal aliens the families who testified today wish to see deported. As Chris Crane, president of the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Council, noted at the time:Senator Rubio left unchanged legislative provisions that he himself admitted to us in private were detrimental, flawed and must be changed. Legislation written behind closed doors by handpicked special interest groups which put their political agendas and financial gains before sound and effective law and the welfare and safety of the American public. As a result, the 1,200 page substitute bill before the Senate will provide instant legalization and a path to citizenship to gang members and other dangerous criminal aliens, and handcuff ICE officers from enforcing immigration laws in the future. It provides no means of effectively enforcing visa overstays which account for almost half of the nation s illegal immigration crisis.Senator Grassley offered an amendment that would that would have barred gang members, such as the notorious MS-13 gang members who have wreaked havoc across the country, from getting amnesty but that amendment was defeated in the Judiciary Committee. The final bill 68 senators voted for therefore expressly made amnesty available to gang members   an amnesty that included access to green cards, welfare and the prize of U.S. citizenship.As The Washington Post reported at the time, this was part of a coordinated effort by members of the Gang of Eight to quash amendments that might have damaged the likelihood of the bill s speedy passage:The eight met in private before each committee hearing, hashing out which amendments they would support and which oppose as a united coalition. Senate aides said amendments were rejected if either side felt they would shatter the deal.Politico confirmed this report:During the Judiciary Committee markup in May, the Gang routinely met to decide which amendments they would support or oppose. In one meeting, the senators thought they had all agreed to defeat a proposal from Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) to require a biometric exit and entry at points of entry before undocumented immigrants could secure green cards, according to one Senate Democratic aide.The day the bill passed the Senate, National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council president Ken Palinkas and president of the National ICE Council Chris Crane, who together represent more than 20,000 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees on the front line of immigration enforcement, issued this joint statement:ICE officers and USCIS adjudications officers have pleaded with lawmakers not to adopt this bill,  they wrote,  The Schumer-Rubio-Corker-Hoeven proposal will make Americans less safe and it will ensure more illegal immigration especially visa overstays in the future. It provides legalization for thousands of dangerous criminals while making it more difficult for our officers to identity public safety and national security threats. The legislation was guided from the beginning by anti-enforcement special interests and, should it become law, will have the desired effect of these groups: blocking immigration enforcement. This is anti-public safety bill and an anti-law enforcement bill.Immigration and the transformation of America is shaping up to be the most passionate issue of the 2016 race.When Governor. Scott Walker (R-WI) was question by a DREAMer during a recent campaign stop and said illegal aliens seeking to become Americans needed to return home. He also suggested at the same stop that foreign worker visas should be limited when American jobs and wages are in danger, a position that polls well with liberals and conservatives alike.Via: Breitbart News",HEAD OF NATION’S TOP IMMIGRATION LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THREATENS Lawlessness In Sanctuary Cities Unless Amnesty Is Passed

He appointed a Hamas supporter to a state immigration commission; spoke at a dinner honoring a Muslim Brotherhood terror suspect; and received donations from well-known Islamist groups.Appointing a Muslim Brotherhood Front Leader Who Supports HamasIn 2007, Kaine was the Governor of Virginia and, of all people, chose Muslim American Society (MAS) President Esam Omeish to the state s Immigration Commission. A Muslim organization against Islamism criticized the appointment and reckless lack of vetting.Federal prosecutors said in a 2008 court filing that MAS was  founded as the overt arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in America.  A Chicago Tribune investigation in 2004 confirmed it, as well as MAS  crafty use of deceptive semantics to appear moderate. Convicted terrorist and admitted U.S. Muslim Brotherhood member Abdurrahman Alamoudi testified in 2012,  Everyone knows that MAS is the Muslim Brotherhood. When a state delegate wrote a letter to then-Governor Kaine warning him that the MAS has  questionable origins,  a Kaine spokesperson said the charge was bigotry.Kaine obviously failed to do any kind of basic background checking in Omeish.Speaking at a Dinner Honoring Muslim Brotherhood Terror SuspectIn September 2011, Kaine spoke at a  Candidates Night  dinner organized by the New Dominion PAC that presented a Lifetime Achievement Award for Jamal Barzinji, who the Global Muslim Brotherhood Watch describes as a  founding father of the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood. He first came on to the FBI s radar in 1987-1988 when an informant inside the Brotherhood identified Barzinji and his associated groups as being part of a network of Brotherhood fronts to  institute the Islamic Revolution in the United States.  The source said Barzinji and his colleagues were  organizing political support which involves influencing both public opinion in the United States as well as the United States Government  using  political action front groups with no traceable ties. The indictment of Al-Arian and his colleagues says that they  would and did seek to obtain support from influential individuals, in the United States under the guise of promoting and protecting Arab rights Islamist Financial SupportBarzinji s organization, IIIT, donated $10,000 in 2011 to the New Dominion PAC, the organization that held the event honoring Barzinji that Kaine spoke at. The Barzinji-tied New Dominion PAC donated $43,050 to Kaine s gubernatorial campaign between 2003 and 2005. That figure doesn t even include other political recipients that assisted Kaine s campaign.The PAC has very strong ties to the Democratic Party in Virginia, with the Virginia Public Access Project tallying almost $257,000 in donations. This likely explains why Barzinji s grandson served in Governor McAuliffe s administration and then became the Obama Administration s liaison to the Muslim-American community.The Middle East Forum s Islamist Money in Politics database shows another $4,300 donated to Kaine s Senate campaign in 2011-2012 by officials from Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Another $3,500 came from Hisham Al-Talib, a leader from Barzinji s IIIT organization.It s worth noting that Barzinji s IIIT donated $3,500 to Esam Omeish s 2009 campaign delegate campaign, tying together the cadre of Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders who got into Kaine s orbit.WHO IS HUMA ABEDIN?

Politico reported the news of the coming DOJ investigation earlier today:JUSTICE TO PROBE CENTER FOR MEDICAL PROGRESS   While congressional committees investigate Planned Parenthood s practices, the Justice Department agreed to look into whether the group that released the sting videos obtained the footage legally. In response to a request by House Democrats, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday afternoon that Justice would  review all of the information and determine what the appropriate steps moving forward would be.  Planned Parenthood has staunchly defended its practices and claims that the Center for Medical Progress illegally obtained its footage, then excessively edited it to misrepresent what the organization does. The DOJ investigation of the Center for Medical Progress, which, unlike Planned Parenthood, is not in the business of killing healthy, viable unborn babies in order to sell their organs for cash, was announced after several Democratic lawmakers called for the organization to be targeted:Four Democrats in Congress   Reps. Jan Schakowsky, Zoe Lofgren, Jerry Nadler, and Yvette Clarke   have written to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and California Attorney General Kamala Harris, asking them to open investigations into the Center for Medical Progress. The Democrats say the videos were filmed as part of an  elaborate scheme    using  fake identification  and without the approval of the Planned Parenthood doctor who appears in them. It s interesting that Lynch decided so early to make a statement about the group. There are certainly more videos to come, and if Planned Parenthood s panicked press releases are any indication, the footage may be far more damaging than anything that s been revealed thus far. However, given the abject politicization of multiple agencies under Obama s command   including the Internal Revenue Service, which targeted conservative non-profits, and the DOJ, which has been hesitant to investigate Obama allies   it seems unlikely that Lynch and those who report to her will ever crack down on Abortion, Inc.Via: The Federalist",OBAMA IGNORES PLANNED PARENTHOOD BABY PARTS HARVESTER STORY…His DOJ Goes After Whistleblower Group Who Exposed Them

I have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit. Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president,  Ivana Trump, Donald s ex-wife, said in the statement to CNN.Donald and Ivana Trump had three children together Ivanka, Eric and Donald, Jr., Donald s oldest children and now all officials at Trump s company three of Trump s five children.The embarrassing and quick putdown of the Daily Beast story comes just hours after the outlet ran a blistering headline falsely accusing him of rape:  Ex-Wife: Donald Trump Made Me Feel  Violated  During Sex. The sub-headline of the inaccurate article was even worse, directly leveling the false rape allegation:  Ivana Trump once accused the real-estate tycoon of  rape,  although she later clarified: not in the  criminal sense. The way they justified dredging up the three-decade-old allegation from divorce proceeding transcript, which was again per Ivana s statement to CNN clearly false? Donald Trump introduced his presidential campaign to the world with a slur against Mexican immigrants, accusing them of being  rapists  and bringing crime into the country.  Mak and Zadrozny wrote as the lead of their article before delving into the lurid, old and disproven details.  I mean somebody s doing it!  Who s doing the raping?  Donald Trump said, when asked to defend his characterization. It was an unfortunate turn of phrase for Trump in more ways than one. From there, they delve into the old allegations:  Not only does the current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination have a history of controversial remarks about sexual assault, but as it turns out, his ex-wife Ivana Trump once used  rape  to describe an incident between them in 1989. She later said she felt  violated  by the experience. The incident did come up in the divorce proceedings transcripts and was first reported on widely and publicly by former Texas Monthly and former Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III in his 1993 book:  Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J.

He s followed by Dr. Ben Carson at 5 percent, Ted Cruz and John Kasich at 4 percent, and Rand Paul at 3 percent. 16 percent are unsure or are supporting another candidate not named in the survey.When it comes to the GOP Senate race, however, there is no clear front-runner at all, some 13 months before the primary election.Among those who actually have an opinion, Pinellas County congressman David Jolly gets 10 percent support, with Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera and Jacksonville area Congressman Ron DeSantis right behind him, essentially tied at 9 percent. Lopez-Cantera gets 9.2 percent support, DeSantis 8.9 percent.Former combat veteran and businessman Todd Wilcox gets 5 percent support (5.2%), tying him with North Florida congressman Jeff Miller (4.9%), who is not officially in the race.But an overwhelming 61 percent say they are undecided.That s a change from a similar poll taken two weeks ago, where Jolly garnered 22 percent support, 10 percent more than Miller.In terms of the reliability of this survey, Matt Florell of St. Pete Polls said his firm has had an impressive run the past three years, with several of its polls coming with the margin of error with final election results. The polling  almost always predicted the eventual winner of the election,  Florell said, citing the recent Jacksonville mayoral election and many of the general election races in 2014.

The vernal pools, temporary bodies of water that house certain species of plants and animals, are protected as waters of the United States by the Clean Water Act of 1972. We expected the Trump administration to provide regulatory relief from Obama-era overreach, and we haven t seen it yet,  Duarte said according to the Record Spotlight.  We re hoping to see the administration engage this issue, to look at it again.

The woman, 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle ( Kate ), was struck in the chest with a bullet while visiting Pier 14 on the Embarcadero with her family. She was rushed to a nearby hospital but doctors were unable to save her, as she died in her parents  arms a few hours later.The suspect, Francisco Sanchez, was identified as being in his mid-40s and on probation from Texas due to previous, undisclosed crimes. He was arrested after tips from passers-by. Officials said that the killing appeared to be random. Police believe they have recovered the murder weapon from the waters of the San Francisco Bay near the pier, where the suspect allegedly tossed it.On Thursday, two news crews filming live at Pier 14 were mugged at the scene, and one cameraman was pistol-whipped.The San Francisco Chronicle described Steinle s last moments in heartbreaking detail: She fought for her life,  [Liz] Sullivan said, adding that her daughter s heart had stopped two times, and was restarted, in the ambulance. It was a battle, but she just didn t make it,  she said.  It was horrific, but we knew the minute they came to talk to us, it wasn t good. But it was so nice to go in and be with her. Sullivan said that in their final moments together, she softly touched her daughter s face   a face she used to paint when the young woman was a little girl.

Sununu:  If the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice, the White House should have been officially notified. Sununu:  What bothers me the most and there must be a reason for it, is Mueller making four of his first hires so blatantly biased lawyers, pro-Democrat lawyers with a bias certainly against the President. Maybe Mueller has decided internally that this isn t going anywhere and that the only way he can have credibility on a decision saying that there s nothing there is to have that decision come from a group of lawyers that are so blatantly biased against the President.

They re probably too busy schmoozing with open-borders Paul Ryan and other more easily influenced politicians.

Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2016The Kochs are effectively indifferent between Trump and Clinton, though several Trump allies within the network have encouraged the billionaire donors to at least meet with the billionaire candidate. Donors who contribute at least $100,000 to the network are invited to hear from Charles Koch and Republican leaders both about the Kochs  political work along with their philanthropic and policy-focused spending.Some Koch donors, upset by the leadership s unwillingness to back the Republican nominee, have called for the Freedom Partners retreat to feature a poll to decide whether to marshal their resources toward his White House bid. But Holden said unequivocally that a decisive survey of that kind would not happen.May, 2014   Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank notes that,  More than 100 times on the Senate floor in the past few months, the Senate s top Democrat has invoked Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into conservative causes and campaigns. According to Reid, the Koch brothers  are about as un-American as anyone I can imagine  and are attempting to  buy America.  Well, if it is true and what these billionaires are truly engaged in a diabolical plot to undermine the country, then Reid must count himself as one of their prime accomplices.Guess who is putting up lots of money to pressure House Republicans to pass a massive amnesty and immigration increase bill similar to the one Reid championed in the Senate? That would be none other than the Brothers Koch.   Immigration ReformThe Kochs have assembled a political operation some consider to be on par with the Republican National Committee, using a constellation of nonprofit organizations to drive elections and policy fights in recent years. They today have 1,200 paid staff members in 38 states.Yet their refusal to back Trump   whose language on immigration and trade is found to be too incendiary by the libertarian-inspired Kochs   is a leading reason why Trump is expected to be massively outgunned by Clinton and her allies in the advertising wars.The Koch network initially said they would spend $889 million in the lead-up to 2016, with about one-third of that figure dedicated to political activity. Yet Koch officials have scaled back their ambitions, with Holden saying Saturday that the sum was merely a  wish list number. They are now on pace to spend about $750 million, including about $250 million on politics.About $20 million in television has already aired, network officials said, with another $20 million still planned for the fall.

"Jul 8, 2015","WHAT THE HECK! What s happened to the Southern leaders? Confederate flags should be placed on the graves of Civil War soldiers. This is way over the top and a knee-jerk reaction to the shooting in Charleston, SC.The House has voted to ban the display of Confederate flags at historic federal cemeteries in the deep South.The low-profile move came late Tuesday after a brief debate on a measure funding the National Park Service, which maintains 14 national cemeteries, most of which contain graves of Civil War soldiers.The proposal by California Democrat Jared Huffman would block the Park Service from allowing private groups from decorating the graves of southern soldiers with Confederate flags in states that commemorate Confederate Memorial Day. The cemeteries affected are the Andersonville and Vicksburg cemeteries in Georgia and Mississippi.Pressure has mounted to ban display of the flag on state and federal property in the wake of last month s tragic murders at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina.SELLING CONFEDERATE FLAGS BANNED TOO:The House voted to affirm that stores on federal lands operated by the National Park Service cannot sell Confederate flags, in light of a new policy announced in the aftermath of the shooting in Charleston, S.C.Adoption of the amendment to the 2016 Interior Department appropriations bill came easily on a voice vote after just six minutes of debate, where no one spoke in opposition. The amendment reflects a policy announced by the National Park Service in June to ban the sale of Confederate flag merchandise from its gift shops and bookstores.Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), the author of the amendment, said it was important that Congress prevent the sale of the Confederate image on federal property. This House now has an opportunity to add its voice, by ending the promotion of the cruel, racist legacy of the Confederacy,  Huffman said.

"Jun 1, 2015","How many American taxpayer dollars have already been used by the Obama regime to spy on, discredit and dismantle conservative groups like the Tea Party? Is anyone else beginning to feel like the Obama regime is one big union who forces members to pay dues that are used to fund, and ensure the success of the Democrat party? The Department of Justice is concentrating on  far-right  groups in a new study of social media usage aimed at combatting violent extremism.The Justice Department s National Institute of Justice (NIJ) awarded Michigan State University $585,719 for the study, which was praised by Eric Holder, the former attorney general, earlier this year. There is currently limited knowledge of the role of technology and computer mediated communications (CMCs), such as Facebook and Twitter, in the dissemination of messages that promote extremist agendas and radicalize individuals to violence,  according to the NIJ grant.  The proposed study will address this gap through a series of qualitative and quantitative analyses of posts from various forms of CMC used by members of both the far-right and Islamic extremist movements. The study draws more upon right-wing forums than upon the corners of the web inhabited by Islamist extremists. We will collect posts made in four active forums used by members of the far-right and three from the Islamic Extremist community, as well as posts made in Facebook, LiveJournal, Twitter, YouTube, and Pastebin accounts used by members of each movement,  the grant said. The findings will be used to document both the prevalence and variation in the ideological content of posts from members of each movement,  the grant continued.  In addition, we will assess the value of these messages in the social status of the individual posting the message and the function of radical messages in the larger on-line identity of participants in extremist communities generally. The project will also  identify the hidden networks of individuals who engage in extremist movements based on geographic location and ideological similarities. The results will be used for a public webinar, and for presentations for counterterrorism experts in the United States.Holder highlighted the study in remarks this February at the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism, as an example of the new methods the Justice Department is using to combat terrorist threats.Holder said the study will  help us develop more effective techniques and partnerships for counter-messaging. While the grant does not name the  far-right  groups that would be examined, other federal agencies have devoted their energy to the sovereign citizen movement.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a report on the movement, whose members believe that U.S. laws do not apply to them, just as the White House held its summit on violent extremism. The administration did not use the phrase  Islamist extremism  at the summit.DHS stirred controversy in 2009 when it issued a report on right-wing extremism, which included veterans returning from combat as a potential terrorist threat.The Justice Department and Michigan State University did not return requests for comment by press time.Via: Washington Free Beacon",TAXPAYER FUNDED OPERATION CONSERVATIVE TAKE DOWN : DOJ Awards MI State Univ Huge Grant To Study ‘Far Right” Groups Use Of Social Media
"Jun 1, 2016","Ironically, the two issues that catapulted Trump past all of his competitors in the GOP Presidential race were building the wall on our southern border and not allowing unveiled refugees to enter our country. We re gonna go out on a limb and guess that based on Trump s popularity with a wide variety of Americans, both issues are pretty important when it comes to our national security.Hillary Clinton will launch an attack on Donald Trump s national security policy Thursday, focusing on an issue the likely Democratic presidential nominee could use to her advantage over the billionaire New Yorker.The address in San Diego will  make clear the threat that Donald Trump would pose to our national security and to put forth her own vision for keeping America safe at home and leading in the world,  Clinton s campaign said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.For Clinton, the move is part of an effort to paint Trump as fundamentally unsuited to lead the world s most powerful military as she hopes to pivot away from the extended Democratic primary and toward a general election match-up with the presumptive GOP nominee.The attacks on Trump s lack of national security bona fides have increased speculation that he might pick a running mate with more experience in the defense or foreign policy, such as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). Throughout this campaign, Trump has refused to outline any coherent foreign policy doctrine, failed to demonstrate a basic understanding of world affairs, and repeatedly proven he s temperamentally unfit to serve as our commander in chief,  Clinton s campaign said on Wednesday.Despite his apparent weaknesses, however, Trump benefitted the most when the GOP primary contest took on a national security focus following deadly terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino last year. Notwithstanding their radical nature, Trump s proposals to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and temporarily ban foreign Muslims from entering the country have attracted a fair amount of support from fellow Republicans.",LOL!

"Jun 10, 2015","Before we explore the actual details of Marco Rubio s  extravagant purchase,  let s take a look at the brilliant tweet by Bill Sanderson, pointing out the hypocrisy of the left by comparing Marco Rubio s family home to Hillary s:https://twitter.com/mrgeology/status/608344761758568448After doing a deep dive on the Rubio s traffic violation history last week (just kidding, it wasn t a deep dive but instead information handed over by the far left American Bridge), the New York Times is back for more publishing of American Bridge material. This time, the NYT is letting everyone know just how broke the Rubio s were when they were young(er), just like everyone else in America. Oh, and that he s had trouble with his finances like every other person in America. And, he likes fun toys like any good man in America.For years, Senator Marco Rubio struggled under the weight of student debt, mortgages and an extra loan against the value of his home totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. But in 2012, financial salvation seemed to have arrived: A publisher paid him $800,000 to write a book about growing up as the son of Cuban immigrants.In speeches, Mr. Rubio, a Florida Republican, spoke of his prudent plan for using the cash to finally pay off his law school loans, expressing relief that he no longer owed  a lady named Sallie Mae,  as he once called the lender. Oh, and guess what guys? Marco Rubio had the nerve to buy a speed boat in Florida. How irresponsible. UPDATE: It was a fishing boat for his family, not an  extravagant   luxury speedboat  as the NYT claims.But at the same time, he splurged on an extravagant purchase: $80,000 for a luxury speedboat, state records show. At the time, Mr. Rubio confided to a friend that it was a potentially inadvisable outlay that he could not resist. The 24-foot boat, he said, fulfilled a dream.Here s a photo of the boat, and no, that isn t Rubio driving the boat.This is so ridiculous I m actually laughing at my computer right now. Rubio had student loan debt? Yeah, so? A lot of people do. The Rubios had trouble balancing their spending? Who doesn t? Rubio took out a loan on his home to make ends meet? Good for him, lots of people do. He was paid a hefty amount of money to write a book about his upbringing that he used to pay off debt? Even better. He had more than one home now? Cool, wish I did too. He spent $80,000 on a speed fishing boat in ocean surrounded Florida after paying off his debt? How could he?!Marco Rubio and his family are normal people chasing the American Dream and that scares the hell out of  dead broke so we could pay mortgages  Hillary Clinton supporters. The different between Rubio and Clinton is that Rubio embraces success and policies that allow every American to own multiple homes and a speed boat someday. Clinton, however, relishes in wealth instead of encouraging Americans to become wealthy themselves to live the good life. According to Clinton, not everyone can be queen.Via: Townhall",MARCO RUBIO IS CALLED IRRESPONSIBLE FOR BUYING A FISHING BOAT…Hillary Buys A Mansion In NY To Run For Senate…Crickets

Those decisions have been made by doctors and unit commanders. The new Air Force policy requires those decisions to be reviewed by high-level officials at Air Force headquarters. Though the Air Force policy regarding involuntary separation of gender dysphoric Airmen has not changed, the elevation of decision authority to the Director, Air Force Review Boards Agency, ensures the ability to consistently apply the existing policy,  Daniel Sitterly, a top Air Force personnel official, said in a statement.The Air Force and Army moves follow a number of statements from top Pentagon officials about dismantling the policy allowing transgender troops to be kicked out of the services. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said this year in response to a question about transgender service that ability to perform military tasks should be the standard for eligibility.Air Force Secretary Deborah James expressed openness to allowing transgender troops to serve. From my point of view, anyone who is capable of accomplishing the job should be able to serve,  James told USA TODAY.  And so I wouldn t be surprised if this doesn t come under review.

Hillary Clinton is fighting a rearguard action to avoid further damage to her standing with the crucial Jewish vote in her campaign for a Senate seat after a claim that she once used an ethnic insult against one of Bill Clinton s aides.A book out today claims that 26 years ago she called Paul Fray, her husband s campaign manager at the time, a  fucking Jew bastard .Mrs Clinton denied the allegation and pressed the president into supporting her, but the author, Jerry Oppenheimer, said:  Three witnesses have now publicly acknowledged that she said it. I have never said anything like that, ever,  Mrs Clinton said.  I have in the past certainly, you know maybe, called somebody a name. But I have never used an ethnic, racial, anti-Semitic, bigoted, discriminatory, prejudiced, accusation against anybody. I ve never done it. I ve never thought it. Mr Clinton, who was trying to bring about a Middle East peace deal at Camp David, backed her up.  I was there on election night in 1974 and the charge is simply not true,  he said. She might have called him a bastard, I wouldn t rule that out. She s never claimed that she was pure on profanity. But I ve never heard her tell a joke with an ethnic connotation. She s so fanatic about it. It s not in her. Referring to a  vast rightwing conspiracy  in previous elections, he said:  This is part of a pattern. They couldn t defeat me politically and they can t defeat her politically so they go after us personally. Accounts of the dispute on election night 1974, when Mr Clinton failed to win a congressional seat representing Arkansas, have appeared before without the ethnic insult.Those present at the inquest into the defeat were Mr Clinton, his then-girlfriend Hillary, his campaign manager Paul Fray, and Mr Fray s wife, Mary Lee. Neill McDonald, a campaign worker, was just outside the room and claims to have heard everything.The Frays and Mr McDonald are the three witnesses on whom Mr Oppenheimer, a former reporter on the National Inquirer tabloid, relies for the passage in his book State of a Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton.Mr Fray, 57, said yesterday:  I was a little defensive about it. I looked to the floor thinking  How do I respond?  I didn t mind being called a son-of-a-bitch, but when it came to attacking my culture, that s a whole  nother ballgame. You ve got to understand it was the heat of the moment. We knew we had lost. It was a case of people lashing out at one another and it just got to that point. Mr Fray is actually a Southern Baptist but says that he is one-eighth Jewish through his great-grandfather.Mrs Fray said that her husband s recollection of the meeting, which lasted about an hour, was accurate.

MVA is used to abort a child from 3 weeks to 12 weeks of age. This handheld syringe works by creating its own vacuum/suction. MVAs are used and reused millions of times a year around the world. The major problem with the MVA is that it has a very weak vacuum. This means that the child is ripped apart slowly.Number of Americans of all ages and races  murdered daily by handguns   28Number of American babies of all races killed every day by abortion   3,000Uterine Currette One side of the loop is sharp for cutting the child apart. The other side scrapes the uterus to remove the placenta.Syringe with Spinal Needle This abortion instrument s uses include injecting saltwater into the uterus. The baby swallows and breathes the poison. The cause of the death is congestion, hemorrhage and shock. The mother goes into premature labor about a day later and delivers a dead child. The other use is to inject the chemicals (digoxin, potassium chloride, etc.) into the heart of the baby.

"Jun 14, 2016","When you read these statistics, the Orlando massacre of 49 innocent men and women in a public space should really come as no surprise to anyone who s paying attention Between 2001 and 2014, the United States has permanently resettled nearly three quarters of a million migrants (674,920) from nations that may execute gays and lesbians   including a quarter of a million (250,387) who were resettled during Hillary Clinton s tenure in the State Department. As Secretary of State, Clinton was in charge of screening visas for admission, which some foreign nationals could then adjust to receive green cards.Following the Orlando terrorist attack, in which the son of Afghan migrants targeted the LGBT community and slaughtered 49 people in a gay nightclub, Donald Trump called for a common-sense,  mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.  Indeed, new evidence has shown that the Orlando terrorist s anti-Western values were imported from overseas   and were not  homegrown  or native to the United States absent immigration.Trump explained that the values of radical Islam   which our current immigration policies are importing into America   are  incompatible with Western values and institutions :A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation. It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation  Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions. Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American. I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.Trump pledged that, as President, he would curb the flow of assimilation-resistant migrants from terror-prone regions that  share these same oppressive views. Following the attack, the Washington Post published a list of mostly Muslim countries where homosexuality may be punished by death. The Washington Post, however, did not deem it necessary to make any mention of how many migrants from these nations that hold anti-Western, anti-LGBT values are being resettled throughout the United States.Between 2001 and 2014, the U.S. permanently resettled 674,920 migrants from nations where gays can be executed, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).This figure does not include the total number of migrants the U.S. has permanently resettled from Muslim nations during that time, which is nearly 1.7 million.To see the breakdown of how many migrants the U.S. has admitted from countries where homosexuality can be punishable by death, click HERE.Many Washington politicians, however, have pushed to continue   and even expand-   the already record high levels of immigration from nations that hold anti-Western values.Hillary Clinton is joined in her opposition to pausing Muslim migration by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who today said that temporarily pausing Muslim migration is  not reflective of our principles  and is not  in our country s best interest. In stating his opposition to Trump s proposal, Ryan did not explain how American communities have been made better by such historic flows of Sharia-sympathetic migrants or   as Donald Trump put it    why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.

"Jun 14, 2017","And we wonder why violence like today s shooting happened The left started with the violence during the 2016 and continued to escalate it once they lost. We have key Democrats calling for violent resistance in the streets Sick!Can anyone imagine a sitting Republican Senator calling for violence or fighting in the streets in opposition to a newly elected Democratic President? Speaking of p*ssies On Tuesday Democratic Senator Time Kaine told the Morning Joe in an interview that Democrats need to fight the Trump administration including online and on the streets in addition to the at the ballot box.Partial Transcript:MIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST  MORNING JOE : So, broad question about the future of the Democratic Party, especially given your firsthand experience with what we ve all been through. There s so much going on here that we clearly see, you know, places where you   we can criticize what the administration is doing, but how does the party rebuild? How do you prevent overreach in a situation like this? How do you prevent a continuation of the bubble in a situation like this, and how does the party reclaim its reach across the country while fighting these battles? SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): So, the way we get outside the bubble is we take advantage of this tremendous public outcry against the administration. What we ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there s the momentum to be able to do this. And we re not afraid of the popular outcry, we re energized by it and that s going to help us do our job and do it better.  -GPListen to faux man Tim Kaine call for fighting on the streets here. Pay special attention to his comment about the  Women s March  that  was organized under a grassroots  label.'  It sounds like Kaine s admitting that it was organized under a grassroots  label  but that it wasn t really grassroots at all. Why didn t he just come out and admit that it was organized by Soros, Obama and Planned Parenthood?Obama s former AG Loretta Lynch released a video that s a call to action for Democrats. These people who have been stripped of power after being so close to achieving their goals of fundamentally transforming America into something most Americans wouldn t recognize, are serious about starting a civil war in our nation. If you don t believe me, listen to the words of Obama s former AG, who compares the fight against President Trump and his supporters to that of the Civil War:  I know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people. I know it s a time of concern for people, who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on and even being rolled back. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our Founding Fathers. (Lynch s statement about the Founding Fathers is quite ironic, considering that she worked hand-in-hand with former President Barack Obama to destroy the very fabric of our Constitution.) It has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference. They ve marched, they ve bled and yes, some of them died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before. We can do this again. We could also add the DNC s California Chair: In a sign of the vigor of the party s distaste for the president, outgoing party Chair John Burton, a longtime Democratic lawmaker and powerbroker known for his blunt and profane manner, extended two middle fingers in the air as the crowd cheered and joined him.

"Jun 15, 2015","George, Barack and Hillary the axis of evil Professional race activists Deray McKesson and Johnetta Elzie (ShordeeDooWhop), pictured here in Baltimore, helped whip up the Ferguson mobs. This year Fortune Magazine named these two professional activists two of the world s greatest leaders.Many conservatives rightly smelled a rat in the supposed organic race-riot movement that sprang up so quickly in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014 after the shooting death of robber Michael Brown. After burning the Ferguson and Dellwood, Missouri business districts to the ground the radical left has relentlessly sought to recreate the same discord and disinformation in various locations around the U.S. Ferguson #BlackLivesMatter protest leaders have been flown to New York, South Carolina, Milwaukee, Selma, and more recently to McKinney, Texas and Hillary s campaign relaunch in New York.Thankfully, every day patriots and online conservative investigators still fight to shine truth, anywhere  the movement  tries to sow its twisted seeds to foment anger, feed bitterness, and breed division.Much has been printed about the paid protesters and Soros connections.** Nearly half of the roughly 500 businesses operating in Ferguson and adjacent communities, such as Dellwood and Jennings, suffered property damage or lost revenue as a result of the coordinated Ferguson protests and riots.In May black Ferguson activists staged a protest at the office of MORE (Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment) to complain that the group s white leaders collected tens of thousands of dollars in donations off of the Black Lives Matter movement without paying the Black participants their fair share. It was during these protests that Ferguson activists admitted that fellow protesters were making MORE THAN $5,000 a month to disrupt cities, damage property and attack police!In response to these protests MORE released a list of names and amounts paid out to protesters and protest groups who agitated and harassed police night-after-night in Ferguson last fall and winter.The list of over 80 groups and individuals was posted on Twitter by an irate protester. Via Weasel ZippersOne of the protest leaders who showed up in Ferguson shortly after Michael Brown s death was DeRay McKesson from Minneapolis. DeRay and fellow activist Johnetta Elzie (ShordeeDooWhop) were nationally recognized and celebrated by the liberal media as two of the top stars of the violent protest mob.We now know that DeRay McKesson has been working with and for Soros-funded groups since he was in junior high school. We know this because DeRay released his resume online this past weekend.DeRay says he s been living off of savings for the past nine months as he s turned up in Ferguson, Baltimore, New York City, Milwaukee, Selma, McKinney and this past weekend he was at Hillary Clinton s campaign relaunch in New York state.DeRay and Charles Wade, Solange Knowles s stylist, the founder of Op Help or Hush have known each other for three years. Wade and McKesson were regular Ferguson protesters. That means the two have been affiliated well before Michael Brown went on his crime spree. DeRay has used his capacity, as Charles calls it, to push  the movement s  agenda far and wide.DeRay has long been known for his skill at  community organizing .He served as president of his class at Bowdoin College, as well as president of Bowdoin Student Government. While at Bowdoin, DeRay reportedly grew close to Bowdoin President Barry Mills, whose wife, Karen Gordon Mills, served in the Obama Administration. DeRay just happened to stay on the couch of an unnamed Bowdoin alum when he first descended on Ferguson.After graduating from Bowdoin, DeRay worked for the Harlem Children s Zone, run by none other than Bowdoin alums Druckenmiller and Geoffrey Canada. Coincidentally, Geoffrey served on the Open Society Institute s board.Throwback, meeting HCZ's Geoff Canada. pic.twitter.com/ocyw6Yo57q  deray mckesson (@deray) February 16, 2015DeRay also worked for  the movement  linked Teach For America, another radical Soros-funded group.But DeRay s ties to Soros and  community organizing  seemingly date back even further, to McKesson s teen years, at least. Suffice it to say, DeRay has been tied to Soros for more than a decade, through many programs.Perhaps DeRay s long and numerous apparent ties to Soros explain how he was so quickly dispatched to Ferguson, Missouri to take control of the protesters and become the powerfuls  approved and promoted voice on the ground. As DeRay said,  People will come out into the streets to confront a system that is corrupt.  Yet, DeRay seems to be molded, directed, and funded by some of the most powerful men in that very  system.  It looks as if someone may be pulling the strings behind the scenes to foment rage as this astroturf anti-police movement spreads from Ferguson to other points in America.Via: Gateway PunditAND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST...Here s Deray throwing his support behind Hillary on Twitter!

"Jun 16, 2015","If the murderer was arguing in defense of a Republican would the media be working so hard to keep her political persuasion private?  In a dramatic and colorful case with strong political overtones, a Livonia, Michigan woman was ordered to stand trial for murder after allegedly bashing her neighbor to death with a slow cooker following an argument over presidential politics. The news media are studiously avoiding any inquiry into the politics of the accused and those of the victim, which ordinarily tells you the story. A few seconds  worth of internet sleuthing fills in a few details that proceed along the lines any conservative (but no media reporter) would suspect.// <![CDATA[ var p = new anv_pl_def();p.loadVideoWithKey(""eyJwIjoiMTAwMDAxMSIsIm0iOiJTUFMiLCJ2IjoiZXhwcmVzc18xNDM0NDkzMDY2MDA2In0=""); // ]]>https://youtu.be/MxaEuvmBuo4The Detroit News reports:A Detroit woman was ordered Thursday to stand trial in the killing of her friend beaten with a slow cooker after the two argued about politics.Tewana Sullivan, 50, who is charged with murder, cried at her preliminary hearing as she heard graphic details about the fatal Oct. 22 assault on Cheryl Livy, 66, with a kitchen appliance.Oakland County Medical Examiner Dr. Ljubisa Dragovic testified before Livonia District Judge Sean Kavanagh that Livy died of blunt force injuries to her head, face and mid-back.Livy also had defensive injuries to the back of her hands where it appears she tried to protect herself, Dragovic testified.Livy was discovered barely breathing with the cord of the  busted  slow cooker around her neck in her apartment around 10:45 p.m. at the McNamara Towers senior housing complex in the 19300 block of Purlingbrook, officer Thomas Blauvelt testified.Blauvelt said he found  blood all over the walls, all over the floor, all over the victim. In other words, an extremely brutal murder. Not quite ISIS-level, but no swords, cages, or lighter fluid were at hand. Using what was available, a slow cooker (apparently this was a kitchen discussion), Ms. Livy was beaten to death, as she futilely tried to defend herself.The argument was over politics, but no specifics are being given:Defense attorney John McWilliams said the two women had argued over  presidential politics. Whatever the controversy is between Democrats and Republicans,  he said.As a conservative, I am accustomed to vitriol being hurled at me from the left. Sure, there are some uncouth and some violent people on the right, but in this era, one sees racial agitators on the left in particular sparking violent attacks, as, for example, following the shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. I am not aware of any riots in the past several decades by conservatives.The defendant, Ms. Sullivan, is black. We know that roughly 92% of blacks voted for President Obama. The victim, Ms. Livy, is white. Take a look at the Facebook page Justice for Cheryl Livy to see her pictures: This is not conclusive evidence, to be sure. It is possible Ms. Livy was an extreme leftist. arguing with Ms. Sullivan that Obama is not progressive enough. Or maybe Ms. Sullivan was among the small minority of blacks who are conservative, though I have never in my life heard of a black conservative who has tendencies toward violence (Clarence Thomas, Thomas Sowell, Lloyd Marcus, Kevin Jackson   they all tend toward thoughtful). But the odds are that a Democrat assassinated a critic of President Obama ( presidential politics  today necessarily involve President Obama) in the wake of a heated political argument. I d be willing to bet a substantial amount of money on that with anyone who would give me even odds.Via: American Thinker",[VIDEO] DETROIT WOMAN KILLS BEST FRIEND OVER 2012 PRESIDENTIAL RACE ARGUMENT…Media Refuses To Say Killer Supported Obama

"Jun 18, 2015","Just when you thought the 2014 election results would provide America with some checks and balances U.S. lawmakers narrowly approved legislation key to securing a hallmark Pacific trade deal on Thursday, partly reversing a defeat less than a week before, in a boost to President Barack Obama s goal of strengthening U.S. economic ties with Asia.The House of Representatives voted 218 to 208 to give the White House authority to close trade deals such as the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which encompasses 40 percent of the global economy and is close to completion.But the bill, a stripped-down version of legislation which failed at a vote last week, must now go back to the Senate for approval, where a vote is likely next week.The House has been wrestling for weeks with fast-track authority, which lets lawmakers set negotiating objectives for trade deals, such as the TPP, but restricts them to a yes-or-no vote on the finished agreement.Democrats last week dramatically rejected a personal appeal from Obama to back legislation central to his hallmark Pacific Rim trade deal by voting down a companion measure to renew an expiring program to help workers hurt by trade.The trade package consists of three basic components.That measure was cut from the bill approved on Thursday, but the change from the original legislation ensures a return to the Senate, delaying final passage further.In debate before the vote, many Democrats lined up on the House floor to voice their anger with Obama s trade initiative. This thing is modeled after NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), which cost us 5 million jobs,  said veteran Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter.RELATED COVERAGE House speaker: Confident in  pretty good place  on trade vote Republicans, weary of the long struggle to pass fast-track, urged the House to vote and move on.  Enacting trade promotion authority is critical for our economy and for our national security, and so we re going to get it done here today,  Ways and Means Committee chairman Paul Ryan, a Republican, said.CLOCK TICKINGDemocratic Senator Ron Wyden told Reuters pro-trade Democrats were determined to pass both fast-track and the worker aid program and were working on a plan to achieve that goal.House Speaker John Boehner said he hoped the Senate would soon take up fast-track and the worker aid program, which would be tacked on to a bill renewing trade benefits for African countries.But members of the Congressional Black Caucus have warned against using the bill as a  bargaining chip  and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who voted against fast-track, said she did not see a path forward for the worker aid program.Many Democrats, who have strong links to trade unions, fear trade deals such as the TPP will cost U.S. jobs as employers chase lower costs in signatory countries.The House vote is a good sign for the TPP, which would harmonize standards on issues like intellectual property and labor protections and lower trade barriers among the dozen emerging and developed countries.Approval of the TPP would open new markets for major U.S. exporters such as Boeing (BA.N), Ford (F.N), IBM (IBM.N), Caterpillar (CAT.N), Merck (MRK.N) and Cisco (CSCO.O), policy analysts said.Negotiators are under pressure to finish the pact, which is already more than five years in the making, to allow the TPP to clear Congress before 2016 U.S. presidential election campaigns dominate the agenda.Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has yet to take a stand on the deal, but the former secretary of state has said Obama should take on board legitimate concerns expressed by fellow Democrats.Some TPP partner countries, including Japan and Canada, want fast track in place before making final offers on the trade deal, which economists estimate would boost the global economy by almost $300 billion a year.Trade deals are controversial in the United States, which has a share of exports to gross domestic product roughly half that of China, partly because of the country s past experience with NAFTA.That pact freed up trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico and, more than two decades later, is blamed by many for U.S. factory closures and job losses and has soured sentiment toward the TPP.",BREAKING: Republican Majority House Caves To Obama…Narrowly Passes TPA Bill

"Jun 19, 2015","This video shows what happens when a large population of muslim immigrants refuse to assimilate with the culture of residents living in the country where they have immigrated. Instead, muslims in Britain and in countries all over the world are demanding the citizens who have been living there for centuries conform to their extreme radical religious views. In May, new census data published by the British government showed that Islam is set to become the dominant religion in Britain within the next generation.On being informed that the girl did not want to get married, Mohammed Shahid Akhtar, Imam of Birmingham s Central Jamia Masjid Ghamkol Sharif Mosque, said,  She s 14. By Sharia, grace of Allah, she s legal to get married. The Muslim population of Britain topped 3.3 million by the end of 2013 to become around 5.2% of the overall population of 63 million, according to figures extrapolated from a recent study on the growth of the Muslim population in Europe.At the same time, opinion surveys consistently show that voters in Britain view Islam and the question of Muslim immigration as a top-ranked public concern. The British public, it seems, is increasingly worried about the establishment of a parallel Muslim society there.But government efforts to push back against the Islamization of Britain have been halting and half-hearted.What follows is a chronological review of some of the main stories involving the rise of Islam in Britain during 2013.In January, Muslim gangs were filmed loitering on streets in London and demanding that passersby conform to Islamic Sharia law. In a series of videos, the self-proclaimed vigilantes who call themselves Muslim London Patrol are seen abusing non-Muslim pedestrians and repeatedly shouting  this is a Muslim area. One video records the men shouting:  Allah is the greatest! Islam is here, whether you like it or not. We are here! We are here! What we need is Islam! What we need is Sharia! The video continues:  We are the Muslim Patrol. We are in north London, we are in south London, in east London and west London. We command good and forbid evil. Islam is here in London. [Prime Minister] David Cameron, Mr. Police Officer, whether you like it or not, we will command good and forbid evil. You will never get us. You can go to hell! This is not a Christian country. To hell with Christianity. Isa [Jesus] was a messenger of Allah. Muslim Patrol will never die. Allah is great! Allah is great! We are coming! In a January 23 interview with the online newspaper International Business Times, Anjem Choudary, a radical preacher who has long called for Sharia law to be implemented in Britain and other European countries, defended the gang, saying:  This is a wake-up call for society to ask,  where are we headed?  There is a clash between Islam and liberal democracy in hotspot areas of London. Choudary has previously led a campaign, known as the Islamic Emirates Project, to turn twelve British cities including what he calls  Londonistan into independent Islamic states. The so-called Islamic Emirates would function as autonomous enclaves, ruled by Sharia law and governed entirely outside British jurisprudence.In February, Choudary was filmed urging his followers to quit their jobs and claim unemployment benefits so they have more time to plan holy war against non-Muslims.Excerpts of the speech, published by the London-based newspaper The Sun on February 17, drew renewed attention to the growing problem of Muslims in Britain and elsewhere who are exploiting European welfare systems.In the video, Choudary is recorded as saying that Muslims are justified in taking money from non-Muslims, whom he mocks for working in nine-to-five jobs their whole lives. He says:  You find people are busy working the whole of their life. They wake up at 7 o clock. They go to work at 9 o clock. They work for eight, nine hours a day. They come home at 7 o clock, watch EastEnders [a British soap opera], sleep, and they do that for 40 years of their life. That is called slavery. . . . What kind of life is that? That is the life of the kuffar [a non-Muslim]. Choudary urges fellow Muslims to learn from revered figures in Islamic history who only worked one or two days a year.  The rest of the year they were busy with jihad [holy war] and things like that,  he says.  People will say,  Ah, but you are not working.  But the normal situation is for you to take money from the kuffar. So we take Jihad Seeker s Allowance. In March, the London-based newspaper The Independent reported that at least 100 British Muslims are currently active as jihadists fighting in Syria, which has replaced Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia as the main destination for militant Islamists seeking to obtain immediate combat experience with little or no official scrutiny.Also in March, St. John s Episcopal Church in Aberdeen, Scotland, became the first church in the United Kingdom to share its premises with Muslim worshippers. Church officials now welcome hundreds of Muslims praying five times a day in their building because the nearby mosque is filled to overcapacity and Muslim worshippers are forced to pray outside.

"Jun 19, 2016","Oh look Hillary s considering a lying, opportunist, Democrat politician with a vagina as her running mate. It all makes perfect sense if you consider that Hillary s thinking ahead, and that if anything happened to her she wants to make sure she has someone with the same morals and ethics to fill her corrupt shoes In Warren s book  A Fighting Chance,  Massachusetts Democratic senator and potential vice presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren attempts to rewrite history regarding the controversy surrounding her  Native American  ancestry that emerged in the 2012 Senate campaign. What s remarkable is that, at least in the initial book reviews, the press largely allows her to get away with it. In fact, it s virtually ignored that to this day Warren still refuses to release any law school records that may shed light on this controversy.To be fair, most reviews note that Warren has never substantiated her claims of Native American heritage, which is true. The larger and unaddressed issue, however, is whether or not Warren falsely claimed minority status in order to gain an unfair advantage in her academic career. This was a question that was unresolved at the end of the 2012 campaign and it remains unresolved with the publication of Warren s book.Watch Cherokee people from ND tell how they feel about Lying Elizabeth using phony  Native American  status to gain an advantage in obtaining a job:First, what s perhaps most notable about Warren s book is that she even includes a section called  Native American,  in which she reportedly writes,  Everyone on our mother s side   aunts, uncles, and grandparents   talked openly about their Native American ancestry. My brothers and I grew up on stories about our grandfather building one-room schoolhouses and about our grandparents  courtship and their early lives together in Indian Territory. This is ironic because, until the Boston Herald first broke the news in April 2012 that Harvard Law School had repeatedly promoted Warren as a Native American faculty member, Warren never once mentioned these stories of her upbringing in a single press interview, speech, class lecture or testimony at any point, ever, in her decades-long career. What s more, Warren was not listed as a minority on her transcript from George Washington University where she began her undergraduate education, nor did she list herself as a minority when applying to Rutgers University Law School in 1973.In fact, it was not until she was in her 30s and focused on climbing the highly competitive ladder of law school academia that Warren apparently rediscovered her Native American heritage. It s important to note that entrance and advancement in the law school profession is governed by the Association of American Law Schools, which requires registrants interested in teaching at law schools to fill out a questionnaire detailing their education, experience, bar passage and, yes, ethnicity. This information is then disseminated to law schools around the country that, as Warren surely knew, are always on the lookout to add to the diversity of their faculty.A copy of Warren s questionnaire currently resides in the Association of American Law Schools archives at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. However, only Warren herself has the authority to release the complete copy of her questionnaire and to date, she has refused to do so.Watch Warren stonewalling the press over her phony  Native American  status and double down on her refusal to clear the record and release the copy of her questionnaire: Her opposition to such transparency can perhaps be understood in the documented fact that in the years thereafter, starting in 1986, Warren began self-reporting herself as a  minority professor  in the Association of American Law Schools staff directory that lists all law school professors around the country. As the former association chairman told the Boston Herald, the directory once served a tip sheet for law school administrators, in the pre-Internet days, who were looking to identify and recruit minority professors.Remarkably, Warren s explanation to the Boston Herald was that she listed herself as a minority in the hopes that she would be invited to a luncheon so she could meet  people who are like I am  and she stopped checking the box when that didn t happen. Perhaps it  didn t happen  because at no point, at any of the schools she attended or worked at, is there any evidence that Warren ever joined any Native American organizations on campus or in any way interacted with anyone in the Native American community.That did not however, stop Warren from continuing to self-report as a Native American minority. The New York Times reported in May 2012 that Warren was listed as a minority recipient of a teaching award years earlier at the University of Pennsylvania where she had advanced after teaching at several non-Ivy League law schools. Notably, Penn declined to explain to the Times why Warren was listed as a minority.From Penn, Warren moved on to Harvard Law School, where her Native American heritage was touted in multiple articles, including a Fordham Law Review piece that lauded her as Harvard Law s   first woman of color.  Even as recently as 2011, it appears Warren was listed as the lone Native American faculty member on the school s 2011  diversity report,  though like Penn, Harvard also refused to comment.Yet, when the Herald first broke the story in April 2012, Warren claimed she  had no idea  that Harvard had touted her Native American status and claimed she did not  recall  ever citing her Native American heritage when applying for a job. In the months afterward, Warren ducked, dodged and stonewalled subsequent questions, eventually wearing-out the press, and succeeded in winning an election without ever releasing any records that might substantiate those claims.Whether Warren falsely claimed to be a minority in order to game the system and advance her career is a question that goes to the heart of her honesty and integrity. It s also a question that will confront her if she ever seeks higher office.

It s no wonder these people are repeat offenders!A hispanic store owner testified in court through a Spanish translator (Why no English?) that he swindled the American tax payers out of millions via food stamp fraud. Eduardo Leonardo plead guilty to stealing from the USDA by illegally exchanging over a million dollars of food stamp benefits for cash for over two years. I stole from the USDA and the Food and Nutrition Service,  Eduardo Leonardo said slowly in Spanish through a translator in Brooklyn Federal Court.  It was an exchange of benefits for cash. Leonardo, 57,  admitted to committing  food stamp  fraud between Oct. 2015 and March 2017 by giving customers cash in exchange for running their EBT cards for a higher amount, which the federal government would later reimburse.In one instance, an undercover witness from the USDA went into Super Economic and picked up a jar of peanut butter and jelly and crackers, totaling $5.48. The witness then asked Leonardo to exchange benefits for $200 cash and Leonardo charged an undercover EBT card $287.89 and gave the witness $200 in cash, making a $82.41 profit.The USDA lost a total of $1,116,924.27 in the transactions.The scammer has run his store, Super Economic One Way Supermarket out of 104-21 Glenwood Road in Canarsie since Dec. 2011. It became a registered SNAP business on May 25, 2012. Specifically I gave a discounted rate in cash in exchange for them [customers] allowing me to ring up the full amount,  Leonardo said to Judge Ann Donnelly.Remember Ann Donnelly?Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) previously called the  food stamp program,  uses federal tax dollars to aid low-income households in buying affordable and nutritious food. EBT cards are used like debit cards, to swipe at special terminals in retail food stores to use the benefits in exchange for food.Between Nov. 2015 and Jan. 2017, Super Economic conducted more than 57,000 SNAP transactions totaling more than $1.5 million, according to court documents.About 8 transactions were made for $50 or more, an amount that USDA officials say is high for a store that size, which would normally conduct $15 average transactions.Leonardo is set to be sentenced on Oct. 31 and could face a maximum five years in prison WHAAAAT????THIS IS WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING!A man swindles more than a million dollars from Americans yet he gets only 5 years in prison?

"Jun 2, 2015","But what about Hillary being a  formidable opponent  when it comes to women voters? Hillary Clinton had trouble attracting high-powered women to a New York talk hosted by Silda Wall Spitzer two weeks before her campaign officially kicks off. Sources said that after ticket sales fizzled for an intimate, $2,700-per-person,  just for women  meeting on Monday, the event was thrown open to men at the 11th hour, and the deadline extended to buy tickets.The  Conversation With Hillary Clinton  event at Midtown law firm Akin Gump was originally aiming to attract 125 women. An email invitation seen by Page Six said the event is  just for women.  But by Friday,  They d only sold 50 tickets, so they threw it open to men,  a source said.  Ticket sales were supposed to close at 10 a.m. Sunday, but the hostesses were working the phones and pushed the deadline till Monday. We hear about 90 attendees included former Bill Clinton aide Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney and his husband, Randy Florke, Maurice Tempelsman, Jill Braufman (wife of hedge funder Daniel Nir), Jean Shafiroff and Susan Cole. The event began at noon, but Clinton arrived at 1 p.m. in  a royal blue jacket and black pants.  She then took pictures with donors and delivered a half-hour speech before leaving at about 2 p.m.Silda introduced Clinton as a  tough, authentic leader,  which is probably more than she can say about her hard-charging ex Eliot. In a possible nod to her host, Clinton quoted Eleanor Roosevelt, quipping,  Every woman in public life needs to develop skin as tough as rhinoceros hide. Topics included  clean energy,  mental health care for college kids, keeping but  revising  ObamaCare, Vladimir Putin, and America s heroin and meth  epidemic. Meanwhile, on Monday, journalists covering Clinton met in Washington, DC, to grouse about inadequate access to the candidate. When we reached out to a local Clinton campaign rep who helped organize the event, she referred us to Clinton s deputy national press secretary, who referred us to her  rapid response spokesperson,  who, not surprisingly, had no comment.Via: NY Post",HILLARY COULDN’T FIND 125 WOMEN TO BUY TICKETS TO ‘Women Only’ FUNDRAISER…Forced To Sell Tickets To Men

"Jun 2, 2017","The word  nothing-burger  has been tossed around so much lately but it s best used in referring to what the Paris Accord would do to change the climate. IT WOULD DO NEARLY NOTHING! If you heard President Trump s speech yesterday then you know this was one of the HUGE points within his remarks. The cost/benefit was so out of line and so unfair for America! It s safe to say that how much the accord would change climate is a nothing burger but the total loss to America would be HUGE!Here s a list from Breitbart News of the things you can say goodbye to now that our AWESOME President has removed us from the Paris Accord:Goodbye to  American Last.  The Paris agreement was basically an attempt to halt climate change on the honor system. Its only legal requirements were for signatories to announce goals and report progress, with no international enforcement mechanism. As a result, it was likely that the United States and wealthy European nations would have adopted and implemented severe climate change rules while many of the world s governments would avoid doing anything that would slow their own economies. The agreement basically made the U.S. economy and Europe s strongest economies sacrificial lambs to the cause of climate change.Industrial Carnage. The regulations necessary to implement the Paris agreement would have cost the U.S. industrial sector 1.1 million jobs, according to a study commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These job losses would center in cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining. Industrial output would decline sharply.Hollowing Out Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The industrial carnage would have been concentrated on four states, according to the Chamber of Commerce study. Michigan s GDP would shrink by 0.8 percent and employment would contract by 74,000 jobs. Missouri s GDP would shrink by 1 percent. Ohio s GDP would contract 1.2 percent. Pennsylvania s GDP would decline by 1.8 percent and the state would lose 140,000 jobs.Smashing Small Businesses, Helping Big Business. Big businesses in America strongly backed the Paris climate deal. In fact, the backers of the climate deal reads like a  who s who  of big American businesses: Apple, General Electric, Intel, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, General Mills, Walmart, DuPont, Unilever, and Johnson & Johnson. These business giants can more easily cope with costly regulations than their smaller competitors and many would, in fact, find business opportunities from the changes required. But smaller businesses and traditional start-ups would likely be hurt by the increased costs of compliance and rising energy costs.Making America Poorer Again. A Heritage Foundation study found that the Paris agreement would have increased the electricity costs of an American family of four by between 13 percent and 20 percent annually. It forecast a loss of income of $20,000 by 2035. In other words, American families would be paying more while making less.Much Poorer. The overall effect of the agreement would have been to reduce U.S. GDP by over $2.5 trillion and eliminate 400,000 jobs by 2035, according to Heritage s study. This would exacerbate problems with government funding and deficits, make Social Security solvency more challenging, and increase reliance on government s spending to support households.",EVERY BAD THING We Can Say Goodbye To With Our Exit From The Paris Accord
"Jun 20, 2015","The EPA continues to push for more and more restrictions on emissions. The Obama agenda continues and is bolstered by the Pope s call for action on the global warming scam. Anyone with half a brain can see through this political agenda and knows it has nothing to do with any truth about climate. Crazy times!The Obama administration on Friday proposed tougher mileage standards for medium and heavy-duty trucks, the latest move by President Barack Obama in his second-term drive to reduce pollution blamed for global warming.The Environmental Protection Agency issued new rules that would lower carbon dioxide emissions from trucks and vans by 24 percent by 2027. It would cut fuel costs by about $170 billion and reduce oil consumption by up to 1.8 billion barrels over the lifetime of vehicles sold under the rule.The long-expected rules come one day after Pope Francis issued a teaching document calling for the world to take action to slow climate change.Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement that the new rules would help the environment and the economy, as trucks use less fuel and shipping costs go down. He called the rules  good news all around. Gina McCarthy, chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the rules would deliver  big time  on Obama s call to cut carbon pollution. With emission reductions weighing in at 1 billion tons, this proposal will save consumers, businesses and truck owners money,  McCarthy said. At the same time, the rules will  spur technology innovation and job-growth, while protecting Americans  health and our environment over the long haul,  she said.Read more: Sioux City Journal",OBAMA’S EPA PUSHES FOR TOUGHER MILEAGE STANDARDS FOR TRUCKS

Hillary s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?Dolly Kyle   who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated   published the claims about the Clinton couple s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.Bill and Hillary Clinton profess to have always been supporters of racial equality, but anecdotes published in a new book by his ex-lover claim otherwise.Bill was also sued several times by blacks and Hispanics for violations of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.Behind the Reverend Jesse Jackson s back, the Clinton duo called him,  That G**damned n****r .Dolly claims the couple used the same insult toward Robert  Say  McIntosh, one of the leading African-American activists in Little Rock, Arkansas when Bill was governor. McIntosh was dogging Clinton about ongoing relationships with black prostitutes, q charge, she says, Bill never denied.Clinton never denied stories that he was having an ongoing relationship with one black prostitute as well as her friends. He did deny a rumor that he had fathered a child with a black prostitute while governor and took a DNA test that was reported as negative.Rumors of the trysts throughout Little Rock and were aided by  one prominent black female newscaster who used to brag openly around the television station about her relationship with the governor, although they were  only  indulging in oral sex .Bill Clinton and Dolly grew up with Jim Crow laws in place in the plantation mentality of the South and they were in full force during the 1950s and  60s.It was a segregated society in Hot Springs at that time. Black and white students went to different schools. In the movie theaters, black people had to watch the movie from a balcony, use separate bathrooms and water fountains. Signs that separated  WHITES  and  COLORED  were deadly serious and always enforced , Dolly writes.In Arkansas, everyone had to pay a $2 poll tax to vote, and the cost was a huge sum for many black people.The black vote was further diluted by  gerrymandering, a wide-spread practice of dividing electoral districts along racial lines to dilute the black vote .Not one black was voted into the Arkansas legislation in hundreds of elections.In the 1980s, Clinton was sued several times by blacks and Hispanics for violations of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and he lost every case.The district lines were redrawn under court order.Ben McGee was a black Democrat was elected to the state legislature in 1988. Clinton tried to replace McGee with a white Democrat of his choice, claims Dolly.The case went all the way to the Supreme Court was ruled 8-0 against Clinton and the Arkansas officials who challenged McGee s election.In the 1980s, Hispanics were moving into Arkansas in greater numbers and Clinton began racial profiling against Hispanics, she claims.He instituted the racial profiling program three years after his brother, Roger Clinton went to prison in 1985 for dealing cocaine. The program was initially part of his anti-drug program, although Roger s drug suppliers and buyers were white. For no good reason, Bill and Hillary decided to profile Hispanics as drug dealers,  Dolly writes.State troopers now had the authority to stop and search any vehicle remotely suspect of carrying drugs. Specifically, the troopers were to stop and search cars driven by Hispanics, especially those cars with Texas license plates. Clinton was sued in federal court for his Criminal Apprehension Program that was ruled unconstitutional. Billy threw one of his infamous temper tantrums about the ban on his racial profiling of Hispanics and he threatened to renew the racial profiling program in spite of the court s ruling , Dolly reports.

The celebrities who are being compensated for creating live video include comedian Kevin Hart and chef Gordon Ramsay.Some contracts are worth smaller amounts, while 17 of the deals Facebook has signed are worth more than $1 million, according to the document obtained by the Journal.

The live-streaming feature was launched first for celebrities in 2015, then rolled out to everyone.In April, the executive in charge of Facebook Live, Fidji Simo (who we spoke with recently about the platform) told Recode that the company was also working with media partners, and said  in some of the cases that includes a financial incentive.  (Time Inc., which owns Fortune, has a relationship with Facebook that relates to the creation of Facebook Live video).Also in April, BuzzFeed confirmed in a roundabout way that it was one of the partners being paid by Facebook. A story about paying video creators quoted an anonymous source as saying that the social network was paying media partners  around $250,000 for 20 posts per month over a three-month period,  and then mentioned parenthetically that BuzzFeed was one of them.

"Jun 22, 2015","America deserves so much better and should get early serious about our next president. Obama has been so undignified throughout his presidency and unserious on so many occasions. We don t need a nice guy or a funny guy for our next president. We need a serious man who is selfless in his desire to put America back on track. I couldn t think of a better way to spell it out than this awesome piece from White House Dossier that says what we ve all been thinking. I know I m 100% FED Up! with a president who s a partier and NOT a PATRIOT.I wonder what would happen if nine people were murdered in a church and a Republican president jetted out to the West Coast for four days of fundraising and golf. Surely, the sensitivity police would have been brought out in force and locked down the nation s airwaves, commenting on the callousness of the president and the Neanderthal nature of Republicans in general.But Obama returned Sunday night from four fundraisers and two rounds of golf without hearing a peep of protest, his devotion to government having pre-certified him as a caring, sensitive type and rendered him immune to suggestions otherwise.But the parties, the constant golf, the extravagant and frequent vacationing do take a toll. Because Obama does not understand that his presidency, like any other, is within a kind of petrie dish, and every seemingly insignificant mold that grows there is scrutinized by friends and enemies alike.If Obama wonders why nobody in Congress cares what he thinks, why Iran doubles down on its insults as nuclear deal time approaches, or why the Chinese blithely arise strategically placed islands out of depths of the South China Sea, well part of the answer is the unseriousness with which everyone can see this president operates.Obama, who the previous weekend had staged a  what the heck  party for 500 people to celebrate no particular occasion and who, during his California trip, offered a rare interview to a podcast titled  WTF,  has stripped the presidency of what was left of its dignity in the aftermath the fun-loving Democratic president who preceded him.I was reminded of how the actions of a president can echo in unpredictable directions and with unanticipated force when I read last week about an interview former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren did with the Times of Israel. Oren said:The bottom line is that the day that Obama didn t act against the Syrians (for their use of chemical weapons in 2013, and thus failed) to maintain the Syrian  red line,  was the day that the debate (over whether Obama was serious about his military option on Iran) stopped here. Did you notice that? Just stopped. Dead. And everyone went quiet. An eerie quiet. Everyone understood at that point that that was not an option, that we re on our own.Obama didn t understand that when he, as president   as opposed to community organizer   drew a  red line,  it meant something. And when he didn t enforce, it meant something even greater.I recalled then the story about how Ronald Reagan s decision in 1981 to fire most of the illegally striking air traffic controllers reverberated far beyond our bordersWrites Peggy Noonan, Reagan s biographer and former speechwriter.Foreign governments, from friends and allies to adversaries and competitors, saw that the new president could make tough decisions, pay the price, and win the battle. The Soviets watched like everybody else. They observed how the new president handled a national-security challenge. They saw that his rhetorical toughness would be echoed in tough actions. They hadn t known that until this point. They knew it now.This is why Reagan s secretary of state George Shultz said that the Patco decision was the most important foreign-policy decision Reagan ever made.Everyone knew at the time that it was a domestic crisis. It wasn t until years later that they came to appreciate that it was foreign-affairs victory.People understood this new president was not to be messed with. Just as people understand they can mess with the current one all they like.Read more: White House Dossier",A PRESIDENT WHO’S UNSERIOUS AND UNDIGNIFIED…DON’T WE DESERVE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS?!

"Jun 23, 2015","One more Republican doing his part to aid Obama in his fundamental transformation of America Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) cast the deciding vote for Obamatrade on Tuesday as it squeeked through the U.S. Senate 60-37, and his Senate office is still outright refusing to answer whether he even knew what he was voting on.Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, was the deciding vote necessary for the U.S. Senate to clear the final 60-vote threshold and eventually, later this week, send to President Barack Obama s desk the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) bill that would fast-track at least three highly secretive trade deals that Obama has been negotiating for years.TPA will, now that it s going to pass, effectively ensure the congressional approval of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). The text of the TiSA and T-TIP agreements is currently entirely secretive, even to lawmakers on Capitol Hill and their staffs, though WikiLeaks did uncover several TiSA documents that leaked and prove the deal would surrender congressional power over U.S. immigration policy to the executive branch and perhaps to a newly created transnational entity.The TPP text for the Pacific Rim trade deal that Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL)80% notes would give the Sultan of Brunei who has implemented Sharia Law in his nation and banned Christmas, literally an  equal vote to that of the United States,  on the other hand, is available for members of Congress to read. The only catch is they have to go to a secret room inside the Capitol basement for classified readings to read it in person, they can t take notes, and only their staffers with enough high enough security clearances can go with them to read it and their staff can t go without them.Before the Senate voted on TPA to fast track these deals the first time back in May, Breitbart News asked every Senate Republican if they read the text of the TPP before voting to fast-track it. Only a handful said they did.Sens. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)93% , Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)93% , Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL)80% , Sen. James Lankford (R-OK)60% and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT)100% went to go read it. Rubio, on the other hand, was one of many who has consistently and repeatedly refused to answer whether he read the deal text. His office refuse to answer yet again on Tuesday whether he went to go read it before the first time he voted for TPA or before the second time he did on Tuesday s cloture vote and that means he s again choosing to give the public impression he did not read the text of the deal before he voted to fast track it through Congress.This could have significant implications for Rubio on the campaign trail as he seeks the Republican nomination for the presidency as activists in early states are furious with his decision to support Obamatrade when it s clear he doesn t know what he s talking about.New Hampshire conservative and Merrimack Councilman Bill Boyd, who s endorsed Paul for president, told Breitbart News while on a recent reporting trip to New Hampshire that he s upset that Rubio didn t read the deal before he voted to fast-track it. He s been the biggest advocate against Obamacare and the ACA, and for all the time Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)9% kept on saying  we have to pass this bill to find out what s in it,  Boyd said.You re telling me Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)80% voted for a bill without reading it? Are you kidding? You know what, we elect people to go down there to represent us. At a bare minimum you have staff. Staff should be providing some kind of an executive summary. If it s a thousand pages, you should be cutting it up and giving it to staff and get 10 or 20 page synopses. If your staff can t bring a particular issue on in a two page memo than they have no idea what they re talking about. For Sen. Rubio to admit that, that s kind of surprising. That s kind of surprising not to read a document and make an opinion without even looking at it. You need to be able to formulate an opinion. If somebody gives you the cliff notes version of a bill, that s at least better than not reading it at all. So that s kind of surprising.

"Jun 25, 2016","No evidence No worries Obama s got this one. Meanwhile, the Democrat Party s presidential nominee would already be in jail if King Obama wasn t stalling the investigation In case you needed more evidence that Obama s Justice Department is more interested in proving white people are racists than actually fighting crime, here it is: The FBI is offering a huge reward for anyone that can help them frame a white police officer who killed an armed black criminal in a completely justified shooting.Last week, a white Mobile, AL police officer shot and killed Michael Moore during a traffic stop. I know what you are thinking, no, not fat white liberal gasbag Michael Moore, this was black criminal Michael Moore.On June 13th, Officer Harold Hurst with the Mobile PD was on his way to work when he observed a white Lexus make a dangerous left turn into traffic, almost causing an accident. The officer pulled the vehicle over that was being driven by Michael Moore, with two additional passengers. The ID Moore gave was fake and the car was stolen.Officer Hurst called for back up and asked Moore to step out of the car. The officer observed a .40 caliber handgun in Moore s waistband and ordered him to put his hands up. Instead, Moore reached for the gun so Hurst had no choice but to shoot. On the ground, Moore was still trying to get to the gun in his pants and the officer fired another round. Moore was taken to the hospital where he died.Police recovered a gun from Moore s body and one of the passengers in the car confirmed that he had a gun on him at the time of the shooting. This is as cut-and-dry of a justifiable police shooting as you will ever find, but not everyone sees it that way. Moore s family and local black activists insist this was a murder and accuse the police of a cover up.Because any time black people complain about something, no matter how little evidence there is to support their claims, the feds come running. The FBI and the US Attorney s Office have launched an investigation based on one little weird thing.Officer Hurst was on his way to work and had yet to report for duty. As such, he didn t have his body cam on and didn t capture the deadly confrontation. The feds figure this must be evidence that the officer is lying, even though all evidence points to the events unfolding the way Hurst said they did.With no actual evidence, the FBI is offering a $10,000 reward to anyone who may have recorded the shooting on a cell phone according to AL.com. Seriously? There isn t any real crime going on so the feds want to spend a big wad of cash to help them build a case against a police officer who was just doing his duty? This is pathetic.Obama s Justice Department has wasted millions upon millions of dollars trying to prove how racist America is and come up with nothing. With expensive investigations into the Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric, Garner, Tamir Rice, and dozens of other black deaths yielding no fruit, the administration seems hell bent on spending as much money as possible to prove Al Sharpton is right about something.Michael Moore was driving a stolen car filled with stolen goods. He had a fake ID and a handgun, which was also stolen. A passenger in his car said Moore had the gun and made a move for it before being shot. Why are the feds even looking at this case?And let s keep in mind that this is the same FBI that didn t see a problem with Omar Mateen, the radical Islamic terrorist who killed 49 people in Orlando.

"Jun 26, 2015","George Soros is sticking his nose into voter ID laws and throwing money into lawsuits in several states to get the law overturned. Is this a true effort to overturn the laws or just an effort to gin the base up to vote? There s absolutely nothing wrong with having voter ID! Soros needs to slither away .Hillary Clinton s top campaign lawyer is behind a multi-state push challenging voter identification laws implemented in recent years, efforts that are expected to reach numerous other states ahead of the 2016 elections.Marc Elias, a top campaign lawyer for Hillary Clinton and a partner at the Washington, D.C., law firm Perkins Coie, has filed lawsuits in three states thus far. The nationwide campaign is being fueled with money from the liberal billionaire George Soros.Elias first began exploring the possible challenges back in January 2014. Soros then became involved, vowing to throw his weight behind the effort in collaboration with Elias. We hope to see these unfair laws, which often disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in our society, repealed,  Soros told the New York Times. It is disingenuous to suggest that these laws are meant to protect against voter fraud, which is nearly nonexistent,  Soros political adviser Michael Vachon added.  Clearly they are meant to give Republicans a political advantage on Election Day. Soros has pledged $5 million to propel the campaign. Elias did not return a request for comment concerning his dealings with Soros or the total number of lawsuits they plan on bringing forward. A request for comment from George Soros s press office was also not returned by press time.Democrats ramped up their efforts last month to challenge voter ID laws implemented by Republican legislatures and governors, claiming that the laws disenfranchise minority voters.The first in the series of lawsuits was filed in Ohio on May 8. Three weeks later, on June 1, a second suit was filed in Wisconsin. On June 11, a third lawsuit was filed in Virginia. Further suits are expected to follow in other states.Elias is working independently on behalf of his firm, Perkins Coie, though the Clinton camp supports the effort. Perkins Coie has pulled in more than $40 million from Democratic clients since 2000.The suits came as Hillary Clinton made comments about voting in a number of public speeches.During a speech in Houston on June 4 at historically black Texas Southern University, Hillary Clinton called for a universal, automatic voter registration for 18-year-olds along with early voting up to 20 days before an election. I call on Republicans at all levels of government with all manner of ambition to stop fear-mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they re so scared of letting citizens have their say,  Clinton said during the speech.True the Vote, a right-leaning vote-monitoring organization, sees the campaign as a political stunt to rile up apathetic voters who may not have the same excitement for Clinton as they did for Obama.Read more: WFB",COMMIE GEORGE SOROS AND CLINTON LAWYER MAKE A PUSH TO OVERTURN VOTER ID LAWS IN SEVERAL STATES
"Jun 26, 2016","The anti-establishment tide is rolling across Europe. You really can t blame the citizens for being furious at their leaders for allowing the invasion of Muslim immigrants into their hometowns and major cities. If this sentiment catches fire in America this summer, it will not likely bode well for Crooked Hillary at the polls in November, given that Trump is the ultimate non-establishment politician History professor Gudni Johannesson won Iceland s presidential election after riding a wave of anti-establishment sentiment, final results showed Sunday, although the vote was eclipsed by the country s eagerly-anticipated Euro football match.The political newcomer, who won with 39.1 percent of votes, was trailed by businesswoman Halla Tomasdottir, also without party affiliation, who took 29.4 percent, according to results announced on public television channel RUV.Johannesson only decided to run for the presidency after the so-called Panama Papers leak in April which detailed offshore accounts and implicated several senior Icelandic politicians, including the prime minister who was forced to resign.Throughout the campaign, Johannesson emphasised his non-partisan vision of the presidency, and vowed to restore faith in the political system after years of public anger toward politicians over scandals and financial woes.The victory was especially sweet for the history professor and political commentator, who has never held public office and has no party affiliation, as he celebrated his 48th birthday Sunday.David Oddsson, a former conservative prime minister who had been Johannesson s closest rival throughout most of the campaign, garnered just 13 percent of votes. The representative of the old era  has been rejected, people are looking to the future,  University of Akureyri political science professor Gretar Eythorsson told AFP.The president in Iceland holds a largely ceremonial position. More important legislative elections are due in the autumn.But the outrage that fuelled mass street protests in April and led to ousting of premier Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson appeared to have dissipated somewhat as euphoria erupted over the Icelandic football squad achieving a historic feat in the Euro 2016 football tournament.A North Atlantic island of just 334,000 people, Iceland beat Austria 2-1 on Wednesday to qualify for the last 16 in its first major international competition, and will face off against England on Monday.Britain s vote to leave the European Union also headlined the news on the eve of the election in Iceland, which itself had applied for EU membership in 2009 after suffering a devastating financial crisis in 2008, but abandoned the bid six years later.Like most of Iceland s voters, Johannesson is opposed to EU membership.

Thanks to Obama s open borders and lenient policy on illegal aliens, it wouldn t make much sense for   members of ISIS to bother with a passport or Visa Our southern border is long and U.S. border patrol agents work to fight illegal activity like illegal immigration, drugs and now according to an FBI consultant, the border could be an attractive region for ISIS thanks in part to powerful drug lords. Drug dealers have found a way to move money without it being followed,  said Tyrone Powers, Former FBI Agent.  They found a way to move people in and out and they found a way to move product. That product powers refers to is tons and tons of meth, heroin and pot transferred through a labyrinth of tunnels from Mexico.Drugs that are headed for the streets of the U.S.But these tunnels could easily be an underground highway for ISIS to spawn its brutality here.Sioux City   KMEG 14, FOX 44, News, Weather, Sports The stronger they get over there, the more power they have so I can definitely see, in the future, collaboration between terrorist groups and drug dealers to our south,  said Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, 2016 Presidential Candidate It s individuals they bring into this country, maybe at some point, suicide bombers which is really scary and then weapons of mass destruction,  said Powers.Terrorist experts say the epidemic of unstable leadership in Mexico, combined with ruthless drug cartels creates a vacuum. What s been going on in Mexico creates an opportunity for any organization to try to take advantage of it, whether it s ISIS or Al Shabbab,  said Brandon Behlendorf, Terrorist Targeting Strategist.Two major drug cartels that could attract ISIS cover a lot of land in Mexico. Both skirt the U.S. border.The Sinalos Federation takes up western Mexico and borders Texas to California.Los Zetas occupies eastern Mexico and hugs the southern Texas border.Experts say Al Qaeda already tried linking up with drug lords in Mexico roughly 15 years ago. But to no avail.But Isis is far more determined than Al Qaeda. It makes logical sense for ISIS to do this,  said powers.  But I do not think they ll be catching the intelligence agencies off guard, because this has been a persistent problem whether it was Al Qaeda or any other group.

We could love this more Tennessee hits back at the loony state that banned all state travel to places that they think don t have the right policy in place. The response is epic: Whereas, California has passed legislation banning state sponsored travel to Tennessee and certain other states; andWhereas, the ban stems from legislation enacted by Tennessee that allows counselors to refer patients to other counselors who can better meet their goals, which the California State Legislature has judged to be morally reprehensible; andWhereas, California s attempt to influence public policy in our state is akin to Tennessee expressing its disapproval of California s exorbitant taxes, spiraling budget deficits, runaway social welfare programs, and rampant illegal immigration; andWhereas, Tennessee is pleasantly surprised that California will not be sending its economic development teams to Tennessee to recruit our businesses, but we can still send our teams to recruit their businesses; andWhereas, Tennessee is puzzled why California thinks it is a good idea to prohibit its state colleges and universities from participating in athletic competition in Tennessee (March Madness comes to Memphis this year via the South Regional), Kansas, Mississippi, and North Carolina; andWhereas, this type of ban, the result of legitimate disagreements about government policy, is neither persuasive nor productive for either party and will lead to economic warfare among states, as one sovereign entity attempts to tell an equally sovereign entity how to conduct its affairs by restricting travel thereto; andWhereas, the United States Constitution provides for a strong federal government for the common defense, but the Tenth Amendment grants the several states sovereignty in addressing issues solely within their jurisdiction, and all states should respect this most basic precept of American government; andWhereas, if states such as California persist in banning travel to Tennessee as a punitive action for this body conducting its constitutionally mandated duties as its members see fit, our state leaders should consider strong reciprocal action in banning state sponsored travel to those misguided states; now, therefore,BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED TENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we urge and encourage the Governor, the Speaker of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to ban state -sponsored and state funded travel within their respective jurisdictions to any state of the Union that has banned state   sponsored travel to Tennessee in a selective way, so that the other states feel the pain and not TennesseeBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we urge the other forty-eight states to refrain from imposing their unfounded moral judgment on their sister states as California has done in order to prevent escalating foolishness.Oh boy!

It s clear that Hillary is the anointed one for the Democrats so why would he wait and who would he be waiting for if not HRC?Al Gore declined to back Hillary Clinton for president when asked who he thinks would be next in the White House.When questioned by WPP founder Sir Martin Sorrell at the Cannes Lions festival of creativity about whom he would back for 2016, Gore   Bill Clinton s vice president from 1993 to 2001  notably didn t take the chance to praise Hillary. In a packed Cannes Lions session Friday, Sorrell asked Gore,  Would you refuse to answer the question [who will be the next president of the United States]?  Gore responded,  I wouldn t refuse to answer that question, I would try to cleverly dodge the question   I would say it s actually too early.  Gore merely smiled, but didn t comment further, after Sorrell added,  I think Hillary will win and it would be great to have a female president of the most powerful nation on the planet.  Gore has reportedly had a complicated relationship with the Clintons since 2000. Political insiders speculate Gore may be remaining neutral for now but would eventually back the Democratic nominee. Gore last October described Hillary in an interview with Bloomberg as an  extremely capable person,  adding she did an excellent job as secretary of state and a New York senator. But he also said it was too early and  I am not going to engage in horse race analysis before the horses even go to the gate.  The former vice president used his speech at Cannes to call on the ad and creative world to help him in his fight against climate change. When asked about climate deniers, Gore said it was a campaign run by polluters and compared their actions to the tobacco industry, which employed actors posing as doctors to reassure consumers that smoking was safe:  It was deeply unethical, immoral, destructive, really evil, and that is exactly what the climate denial industry is doing.  Gore believes global warming would be a big issue at the next election:  The age of fossil fuels is beginning to end   years ago a Saudi minister once said,  The stone age didn t end because of a shortage of stones.

"Jun 29, 2015","The children were greeted at the Capitol steps in the communist state of Wisconsin by protestors singing hate songs with signs that read: Republicans and Walker rape or molest women and girls.APPLETON, Wis.   I don t frequent the Capitol building in Madison so I just assumed the  Capitol Singers,  a group protesting Governor Scott Walker in song had faded away.I learned recently however that they are, as a line censored out of the sitcom  Last Man Standing  said of the Clintons,  They re like shingles; just when you think they are gone, they pop back up. I received an email recently from a listener to my radio show who chaperoned a field trip his daughter s 4th grade class at Horizons Elementary School in Appleton took to the State Capitol in late May. The story he shared was simply stunning:Everyone on the field trip to the capitol was eating lunch on the capitol steps. At the same time there was a group of people protesting Walker and Act 10 singing hate songs and holding up signs saying that Republicans and Walker rape or molest women and girls.Another parent pointed out to me that my daughter s teacher was down there singing with them. I thought that I needed to find out what was actually being sung down there because a bunch of students were down there listening and recording on their cell phones what was happening. That is when I realized that they were singing terrible hate songs against Walker and what the signs said.By the way, her teacher was holding a piece of paper with the words they were singing on it. When the kids were on their way back up they started chanting  Walker sucks  and some other mean things. That s when I stopped them and asked why they were doing that and they didn t know what to say. I asked three times and one of the boys spoke up and said that Mr. Niquette was just doing it also. That is my daughter s teacher.Feeling it inappropriate to confront the teacher in front of children, the parent contacted the school to see if such behavior violated school policy. He ended up in an email exchange with the teacher, Scott Niquette:Scott, my issue is you going down there and singing with those people on the field trip.Did you see the signs they were holding? I m guessing that you saw the words you were reading off the sheet you were holding. Do you understand what the children were doing after they saw you down there singing? Scott there is video of you singing that hate Walker song.When the kids were walking back up the hill they were chanting hate speech toward Walker until I stopped them and asked them why. The answer was obvious. Someone with influence in their lives was doing the same thing. You have influence on these children and they trust that you will lead them. For crying out loud Scott those signs were way inappropriate. Talking about molesting children and raping women.In a show of Olympian chutzpah, Niquette pleaded ignorance in his response:With respect to the Capitol Singers, I joined them during my lunch break simply because I enjoy singing. I am currently an active member in our church s choir  I honestly did not see or notice any signs regarding molesting children or raping women when I entered the circle of singers. If I had, I can assure you that a most certainly would have immediately left. Again, I joined them simply because I enjoy singing. With respect to my teaching, I also take that very seriously and take great offense to accusations that I do not  You have visited my classroom on numerous occasions and sat in on a few lessons. What did you see and hear I stick to the objectives and leave the politics out.He couldn t resist joining a group of Scott Walker haters in public but we re supposed to trust he keeps politics out of the classroom? He didn t see what the signs said? He was unclear of the lyrics he was singing off a sheet?I reached out to Horizons principal Karen Brice. Initially she told me she hadn t heard of the incident and frankly found it hard to believe. But she told me she would look into it. A few days later she called me back, saying only that school officials were investigating to determine whether district policy had been violated.Then there is this classic line from Niquette in his email response to the parent:In retrospect, however, I do think I will save singing with the Capitol Singers for a time when I am at the capitol of my own accord to better reduce any opportunities of misunderstanding.Via: EAG News",PARENT FURIOUS AFTER 4TH GRADE CLASS JOINS HATEFUL PROTESTORS AND TEACHER IN CHANT ON CAPITOL STEPS: “[Governor] Walker Sucks!”

Bush is not only more popular than President Obama, a majority of Americans now view the former president in a positive light. A full 52% see Bush favorably, compared to just 43% who do not. Only 49% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Obama. The same number, 49%, do not.Obama s job approval numbers also took a serious dive in the CNN poll. Just last month, the president sat at a 48% approval rating, with just 47% disapproving. Not great, but he was at least above water. Today Obama is upside down a full 7 points, with just 45% approving of his job and a clear majority of 52% disapproving.That s an 8 point drop.On the specifics of his job, other than race relations, Obama is upside down, sometimes by huge margins, in every category: economy 46-53; ISIS 32-63; race relations 50-47; Climate Change 41-49; illegal immigration 36-60; government surveillance 29-67; health care 44-54; foreign affairs 43-55; terrorism 45-51.Since last month, Obama s numbers have worsened considerably on the specific issues of ISIS, immigration, and surveillance.Bush s favorability increase   his first in positive territory since leaving office   is likely due to two things. First, Bush has been nothing but a class act as a former president. He has stayed out of the public eye, except to further the causes like those of America s wounded warriors. He s removed himself completely from politics. People appreciate a class act, and Bush has been nothing but.Secondly, Bush s approval numbers were primarily dragged down by the Iraq War. In hindsight, though, the American people are now seeing that conflict now through a contextual prism they did not have before.As in all wars, major mistakes were made in Iraq. It is only in the television era, especially the 24/7 cable era, that this historical fact of conflict has been turned into something unique and a disqualifier. Nevertheless, Bush won the war in Iraq. The surge won the war in Iraq. It s harder to end a war than begin one. Indeed, everything that American troops have done in Iraq -  all the fighting and all the dying, the bleeding and the building, and the training and the partnering -  all of it has led to this moment of success. Now, Iraq is not a perfect place. It has many challenges ahead. But we re leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people. We re building a new partnership between our nations. This is an extraordinary achievement, nearly nine years in the making. That is not Bush announcing the Iraq War a success, that is President Obama   just before he lost the war in an election year gambit by removing all of our troops, including the kind of stabilizing forces we still have in other countries like Korea and Japan.Compared to Obama s handling of foreign affairs, specifically in the Middle East, the Bush-era is getting a second look outside of the unceasing partisan politics and venomous media frenzies that defined his presidency. It was a long tough road to get there, but by the time Bush left office, things were better in the Middle East. The region had stabilized, or was at least stabilizing. Egypt, Libya, Iraq, and Afghanistan were all quiet or at least quieting. Our years-long engagement, sometimes at a terrible price, had made a positive difference.Obama s cynical political disengagement overseas has come at an even more terrible price. The region is on fire. Iraq is nearly lost. Libya is a terrorist haven. ISIS is on the march everywhere, especially in Obama s Iraq vacuum.War is tough and bloody and difficult and fraught with mistakes. That was true before the television age. It is true now. How would CNN cover an audacious, costly, and largely symbolic Doolittle Raid on Tokyo today? Imagine Lincoln dealing with a Washington Post, New York Times, and Wolf Blitzer in the first few years of the Civil War. It s only after you remove all the political and media smoke that one can gain a perspective.That smoke is mostly dissipated, and the American people can now see that things were better under Bush. It was hell to get there but in the end he won his war. Obama is losing everywhere and showing none of the grit to win Bush did at this time in his own presidency.Obama was supposed to be the cure for all the Bush-era ills. Democrats and the media promised us that.The American people are now realizing that the so-called cure is much worse than the problem, a problem that, as we can see now, did not need fixing.Via: Breitbart News",MISS ME YET?

"Jun 3, 2016","Did you know that government regulations would keep Bernie Marcus from starting Home Depot today? New businesses across America are being strangled by  faceless bureaucrats and politicians who erroneously believe that government  can do it better.    Bernie MarcusHome Depot founder and former Jeb Bush-backer Bernie Marcus has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying the  fate of the nation  hangs on sending him to the White House over Hillary Clinton. Writing for Real Clear Politics, the leading businessman said new businesses across America were being strangled by  faceless bureaucrats and politicians who erroneously believe that government  can do it better . I genuinely believe that if we to started The Home Depot today, we would fail because of the hurdles government, especially the current administration, places in front of small business owners,  he writes.Obama-style government, he adds, is  driving over-regulation, over-taxation, over-litigation, and over-spending  and thus  killing small businesses, which create the majority of new jobs in America. Politicians like Obama and Clinton, aided by the media and academia, have peddled a dangerous sentiment that government can provide for Americans better than the private sector. That s not just false, it s likely the nexus of Trump s massively popular slogan,  Make America Great Again.  We saw it first hand. Donald Trump, he says, is the only man who can  make America great again  by cutting red tape and changing the course of the country. As Americans, the choice is abundantly clear: If you want four more years of President Obama, vote for Hillary Clinton; if you want to take the country in a new direction, vote for Donald Trump. He also issued a warning to Republicans who refuse to back their party s designated nominee: Make no mistake, Republicans who refuse to stand behind their party s nominee are electing Clinton, whether they cast their ballots for her or not. I have a message for the #NeverTrump crowd: Enough already. Donald Trump is our presumptive nominee and it is time to get over wishing it were not so.

My sense is that the rate these hypotheticals are going, you re bound to hear that a future president working on a trade deal might have second thoughts about the Louisiana purchase.But in an interview on NPR s Marketplace yesterday (June 3), President Obama said that enforcing climate change regulations will indeed be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Obamatrade pact that he is currently negotiating with Malaysia and 10 other countries. He said:If we want to solve something like climate change, which is one of my highest priorities, then I ve got to be able to get into places like Malaysia, and say to them, this is in your interest. What leverage do I have to get them to stop deforestation? Well part of the leverage is if I m in a trade relationship with them that allows me to raise standards.In December, Obama will negotiate a multi-country climate agreement in Paris.

"Jun 5, 2016","Bernie Sanders likes to talk about how everyone will be equal using other people s money. It s the most asinine concept and it s not like it hasn t been tried before. We love Larry Elder s personal take on equality and the common sense reasons there will NEVER be total equality especially INCOME EQUALITY:Is there a more brain-dead concept than to empower the government to fight  income inequality ? What sane, normal, rational human being thinks that human talent, drive, interests and opportunity can   or should   result in equal outcomes?Despite my love of athletics, I knew in third grade that my friend, Keith, could run much faster than I could. For two years I played Little League ball, and I got better at it. But no matter how hard I tried or how many hours I spent, I could not hit, run or throw as well as my friend Benji.Later in life, I started playing tennis, and I became quite passionate about it. But most of the people I played against had started playing years earlier, and most had taken lessons for years. I got better, but given my competitors  head start, the gap remained.Financial planners advise clients to start early and stick to some sort of game plan. Is there any wonder that those who do so will have more net worth than those who started later, or who lacked the discipline to follow and stick to a plan? How is government supposed to address these  unequal  outcomes?Most entrepreneurs experience failure before hitting on an idea, concept or business that makes money. Even then, it takes 20 to 30 years of long hours and sacrifice, along with occasional self-doubt and a dollop of luck, to become a multimillionaire.I recently saw a movie starring Cate Blanchett. She is a very good actress, but she is also strikingly beautiful. Is there any doubt that her good looks, over which she had no control, are a factor in her success? Is it unfair that an equally talented actress, but with plain looks, will likely have an  unequal  career compared with that of Blanchett?Speaking of acting, most who venture into that field do not become successful, if success is defined as making a living as an actor. These overwhelming odds still do not deter the many young people who flock to Hollywood every year to  make it. Had a would-be actor dedicated that same drive and personality to some other profession, success would have been more likely, if less enjoyable. Should the government intervene and take from the successful non-actor and give to those who unsuccessfully pursued a long-shot acting career? An ex-actor told me of her recent lunch with a friend she had met when they both left college and pursued acting. While the ex-actor moved on to a different, successful career, her friend stuck to acting, through thick and thin. The actor informed her friend that she recently turned down a commercial. Why? What struggling actor turns down this kind of work? Turns out, through some sort of  assistance  program, said the friend, the state of California is  assisting with her mortgage.  She has no obligation to repay the money, and she will continue to receive the assistance as long as her income is not above a certain level. How does this strengthen the economy? The ex-actor, through her taxes, subsidizes the lifestyle of the actor, who admits turning down work lest she be denied the benefits.But this is exactly the world sought by Bernie Sanders   a government that taxes the productive and gives to the less productive in order to reduce  income inequality. In the real world, two individuals, living next door to each other, make different choices about education, careers, spouses, where to live, and if and how to invest. Even if they make exactly the same income, one might live below his or her means, prudently saving money, while the other might choose to regularly buy new cars and fancy clothes and go on expensive vacations. Is there any question that the first person will end up with a higher net worth than the latter? Is their  inequality  something that government should address?Although Beyonce is a good singer, is there any question that there are others with superior voices? But Beyonce is also blessed with  unequally  good looks, charisma and perhaps better management   maybe better than the other two ladies in her musical trio, Destiny s Child, whom she once sang with. Three singers, in the same group, have had  unequal  outcomes.Communism, collectivism and socialism rest on the same premise   that government possesses the kindness, aptitude, judgment and ability to take from some and give to others to achieve  equality.  Karl Marx wrote,  From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.  And that s the problem. The statement implicitly acknowledges that some have more aptitude, drive, energy and ability than others. To take from some and give to others reduces the initiative of both the giver and the givee.This is the fundamental flaw with income redistribution, the very foundation of communism, socialism and collectivism. One would think that Bernie Sanders would have figured this out by now. But wisdom among 74-years-olds, like outcome, is not distributed equally.Larry Elder is a best-selling author and radio talk-show host.

"Jun 9, 2015","Why are banking powerhouses, European Prime Ministers, a major arms manufacturer, a representative from the US State Department, Facebook and Google all attending the same secret policy summit? One of Bilderberg s founders and steering committee member, Denis Healey said in 2001:  To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair. Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn t go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing. From The Guardian: As one summit closes, another opens. Thursday sees the start of the influential Bilderberg policy conference, which this year is being held in Austria, just 16 miles south of the G7 summit, and in a similarly inaccessible luxury alpine resort. The participant list for the conference has just been released by the organisation, and some big names leap off the page.No fewer than three serving European prime ministers will be attending, from the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium. They will be discussing  European strategy  with the head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, and the president of Austria, Heinz Fischer. Two European finance ministers are on the list: one Dutch, the other George Osborne. The UK chancellor is a regular attendee of the Bilderberg summit, and this year he will be showing off his post-election glow. Unlike that other Bilderberg regular, Ed Balls, who is being invited back despite having by some considerable distance the weakest job title on the list:  former shadow chancellor of the exchequer.Europe s hottest financial potato, Greece, is on the conference agenda, and it s good to know Beno t Coeur , a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, will be there to discuss it in strictest privacy with interested parties, such as the heads of Deutsche Bank, Lazard, Banco Santander and HSBC.The scandal-hit HSBC and everyone s favourite vampire squid, Goldman Sachs, are both extremely well represented at this year s conference. HSBC in particular by its chairman, its busy chief legal officer, and board member Rona Fairhead, who is also on the board of PepsiCo and chair of the BBC Trust. Good to know the BBC is in such safe hands.Other financial luminaries on the list include the vice-chairman of BlackRock, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset Management and the president of the Royal Bank of Canada, which is the nation s largest financial institution. Morgan Stanley will be represented in Telfs by board member Klaus Kleinfeld, who also runs the world s third largest aluminium producer, Alcoa.From the worlds of industry and manufacturing are some eye-wateringly big names. The CEO of Michelin is invited, along with the head of Roche, the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, the chairman of BP, the CEO of Siemens Austria and the heads of various industrial conglomerates such as Techint and Investor AB, companies so large they re hard to classify. Although  gigantic  goes some way towards it.It s a heady step up into the big league for Michael O Leary, the CEO of Ryanair. He ll doubtless be hoping to thrash out a few last-minute deals over dinner with the head of Airbus, Thomas Enders.Apart from making holiday jets, Airbus is also one of the world s biggest arms manufacturers, and the 2015 conference agenda has a distinct whiff of war. Chemical weapons threats and Nato are both set to be discussed. Luckily the head of Nato is there to discuss it.As ever, foreign policy formation is a big part of the conference. Terrorism and Iran both make the agenda this year, and participants can expect a high-level briefing from senior US State Department official John R Allen, the special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter Isil. And it s likely that the subject of Russia will be of interest to the German defence minister and deputy defence minister, both of whom have found the time this week to be in Telfs. As has the head of the Danish intelligence service, who will likely have a part to play in the session of cybersecurity.Finally, it s worth noting the growing presence of Google at Bilderberg. The company s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, is on the group s steering committee; he ll be joined in Austria by his vice-president for engineering, advanced technology and projects, and the vice-president of engineering for the not-at-all terrifying sounding Google DeepMind. They, presumably, will be leading the session on artificial intelligence. This will be listened to with great interest by Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal and director of Facebook, as he continues his quest to merge with computers. But that s another story.For now, the story is: Bilderberg 2015 has an extremely high-powered participant list, featuring a large number of senior politicians and public figures. With participants this powerful, and an agenda containing this many hot topics, the Telfs policy conference is sure to be covered in depth by the world s press. And by  sure to be , I mean probably won t be. For reasons that, as ever, escape me.Via: The Guardian ",WHY ARE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK ATTENDING BILDERBERG’S 2015 LUXURY SECRET POLICY CONFERENCE?

"Mar 14, 2016","So is anyone else wondering why the cop-hating, racist, Bernie Sanders supporter Tommy DiMassimo wasn t arrested and charged with a felony? Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s campaign rallies have become a fixture in the 2016 election season as much for the candidate s rambling speeches as for the frequent interruptions of said speeches.Demonstrators have filed in to Trump rallies across the country, shouting their anti-Trump messages and promptly being ridiculed by rally-goers and led out by law enforcement.On Saturday, Trump began to call for the arrest of protesters as he was repeatedly interrupted, raising questions about the legality of protest and whether Trump can press charges against demonstrators. So what are the answers?The short answer is, no.According to H.R. 347 (signed into law by Barack Hussein Obama in February, 2012) it is ILLEGAL under CURRENT FEDERAL to protest of any type, in an area under protection by the U.S. Secret Service.Because Donald Trump is under Secret Service Protection (as is Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders) and has been since November of 2015, it is a FEDERAL CRIME to protest at campaign rallies, and is in fact, punishable by imprisonment.Free Speech isn t covered at ANY Trump, Clinton, Sanders (or Cruz, Rubio, Kasich) rally because protests are considered to be  knowingly impeding or disrupting the orderly conduct of an official Federal function. Law enforcement has simply tossed out protesters at Trump rallies, but H.R. 347 states that they could be imprisoned for up to a year for trespassing.Demonstrators are technically relegated to free speech zones much like the ones seen on college campuses.Such zones are often used to keep dissenters away from media attention, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.At a recent Trump event at Valdosta State University, in Georgia, the two designated free speech zones were not in sight of the arena where the rally was held. One was a quarter mile away.Trump can call for the arrest of whomever he wants, but he can t do the arresting.He has said, however, that he is  going to start pressing charges  against protesters as a way to intimidate them into thinking twice about demonstrating at his rallies.Based on the change to H.R. 347 in 2012, he may have grounds to press for trespassing charges against any protester who walked into the rally knowing it was a restricted area, according to the ACLU.

The court s Establishment Clause analysis is fundamentally flawed and ignores the separation of powers. Worst of all, it puts our national security at risk.As the Supreme Court has rightly held, the United States Constitution is  not a suicide pact. As I explained earlier this week when we filed our amicus brief with the court in this case, the order in no way violates the Establishment Clause:First, the Executive Order (EO) does not even address religion, whatsoever. Second, the order has a secular purpose: our national security. As we explained: The EO, on its face, serves secular purposes, and no amount of rehashing of miscellaneous campaign trail commentary can change that. . . . [T]he mere suggestion of a possible religious or anti-religious motive, mined from past comments of a political candidate or his supporters, and intermixed with various secular purposes, is not enough to doom government action (along with all subsequent attempts to address the same subject matter).  [A]ll that Lemon requires  is that government action have  a secular purpose,  not that its purpose be  exclusively secular,  and a policy is invalid under this test only if it  was motivated wholly by religious considerations.  Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 680-81 & n.6 (1984) (emphasis added). The order singles out no religion for favor or disfavor. To conclude otherwise is unreasonable, and absurd. The six countries whose nationals are impacted by the pause were countries identified by President Obama and Congress as countries of particular concern. Policy disagreements, hurt feelings, and political agendas are not enough to support an Establishment Clause claim. The court s flawed order will invariably be appealed, and we will be ready to file crucial amicus briefs once again in federal appeals court.Read more: aclj",HAWAIIAN JUDGE WHO BLOCKED TRUMP WAS OBAMA’S CLASSMATE AT HARVARD GUESS WHO Just Made a “Surprise” Visit to Hawaii?

How can his officers feel safe knowing they were putting them in harms way? One can t help but wonder how much involvement our very own corrupt Chicago Community Organizer In Chief had to do with the decision to give the paid protesters free reign to terrorize Trump supporters? A union that represents 54 officers from the University of Illinois at Chicago Police Department is speaking out arguing the chaotic Donald Trump rally on campus last week did not have to escalate to an extreme level of disorder and could have continued as planned.The Metropolitan Association of Police Board Director, Ray Violetto, tells Fox News that UIC Police Chief, Kevin Booker, issued unusual stand-down orders including instructions that officers not bring pepper spray or wear dark gloves to the Trump rally items the union officers say are basic and necessary equipment in any type of crowd control.Violetto tells Fox News the UIC police were the agency in charge considering the Trump rally was on the school s campus and that the officers were in charge of policing the inside of the arena. I think the inside is what started that and I think it carried outside,  Violetto told Fox News.  If you watch the inside of the rally there was a pretty large group there that was getting out of control along with the individual that was at the podium. Violetto said officers were also told not to touch anyone or make arrests. The UIC officers say they have been extensively trained in handling crowds and riots and could have adequately controlled the situation that night.Watch how quickly these pockets of paid protesters turned violent and shockingly, how many police officers were put in harms way:The MAP police say not only were they put in physical danger but they also were potentially left open to lawsuits because the three people who officers say they rightfully and legally arrested were let go without explanation as a result of the Chief s no-arrest order.UIC spokesperson Sherri McGinnis Gonzalez denies the officers  claims and says riot gear was available  if needed. In an email, Gonzalez wrote that pepper spray is typically not used inside the campus arena, officers were not given orders not to place their hands on people, and that officers were told not to wear  dark  gloves, which look  aggressive. Violetto argues there are  no white gloves that are out there. Gonzalez also wrote that most of the UIC officers were in full uniform with personal protective gear, with the exception of plain-clothes detectives who provided surveillance and valuable intelligence.These police officers don t look like they re wearing riot gear, or are very well prepared for the violence at all in these very telling videos taken by Chuck Pullen, who happened to be at the scene : CLICK HEREThe University says Booker was on site and in charge of managing all UIC police activity and coordinated with multiple law enforcement agencies during the event.

And then my mind drifts to Hillary and Benghazi The Obama administration is emptying the military s Guantanamo Bay detention facility of avowed terrorists captured fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but several American service members languish in another military prison for actions on those same battlefields that their supporters say merit clemency, if not gratitude.Among the prison population at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas, are remaining members of the so-called  Leavenworth 10,  convicted service members doing terms ranging from 10 to 40 years for heat-of-the-battle decisions their supporters say saved American lives.[quote_box_center] The very people who protect our freedoms and liberties are having their own freedoms and liberties taken away,  said retired U.S. Army Col. Allen West, a former congressman and political commentator.  I think it s appalling and no one is talking about this issue. [/quote_box_center]The  Leavenworth 10  is the name given to a fluctuating number of men housed at Leavenworth for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that their supporters say were justified. Over the years, a handful have been paroled, and more have been incarcerated.Among the more well-known cases is that of Army First Lt. Clint Lorance, who is serving a 20-year sentence for ordering his men to shoot two suspected Taliban scouts in July 2012 in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. Lorance had just taken command of the platoon after the prior leader and several others were killed days before. The Taliban suspects were on motorcycles and matched descriptions given by a pilot who flew over the area earlier and spotted them as scouts.A Facebook page devoted to Lorance s case has drawn more than 12,000 likes, and supporters have launched a website, FreeClintLorance.com, dedicated to winning his release. A WhiteHouse.gov petition calling for Lorance to be pardoned garnered nearly 125,000 signatures, but the White House has not taken action.Critics say Lorance was given a military trial, and his conviction was based in large part on the testimony of men serving under him.It was September of 2010 when Sgt. Derrick Miller of Maryland, on a combat mission in a Taliban-held area of Afghanistan, was warned the unit s base had been penetrated. An Afghan suspected of being an enemy combatant was brought to Miller for interrogation and wound up dead. Miller claimed the suspect tried to grab his gun and that he shot him in self-defense. But he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.U.S. Army Master Sgt. John Hatley   a highly decorated, 20-year vet who served in Operation Desert Storm and did another three tours during the Iraq War   also is serving a life sentence at Leavenworth. His conviction stems from an April, 2007, incident in Iraq in which he and his unit captured enemies following a firefight. He radioed a U.S. detention facility to notify officials he was bringing in four prisoners, but was ordered to let them go, according to his legal team.Two years later, a sergeant who had served with Hatley, Jesse Cunningham, was facing charges for assaulting another officer and falling asleep at his post. As leverage for a plea deal, he told investigators that Hatley and two other officers had taken the insurgents to a remote location, blindfolded them and shot each in the back of the head. He claimed their bodies were dumped in a canal, though none was ever found.Hatley, now 47, insists he and his men let the insurgents go, but believes he was punished in the interest of the government s relations with Baghdad. When concerns over appeasing a foreign country are allowed to interfere with justice for the purpose of the U.S. government or the military demonstrating that we, the military or the U.S. government will hold our soldiers accountable using a fatally flawed military judicial system, it doesn t matter what the truth is; it matters only that there is only the appearance of the truth,  he wrote in a message to supporters posted on freeJohnHatley.com.Law experts say military service members face a daunting task once accused of committing crimes in the heat of war. Killing on the battlefield is not the same as [a police officer] killing someone on the streets,  Dan Conway, an attorney who specializes in military law, told FoxNews.com.  When a cop uses force, there s a line of duty investigation. When a soldier uses force, it is investigated as criminal, and non-infantry investigators handle the case, many who have no combat experience. If you had experts handling the investigation, you d have much more balance,  he added.While the military rightly holds its soldiers to a high standard of justice, detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay have been freed even with no mitigating circumstances or reasonable belief of rehabilitation. The release of Gitmo detainees began during the presidency of George W. Bush in 2005 when nearly 200 detainees were released before any tribunals were held.According to a March 2015 memo released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, of the 647 detainees transferred or released, 17.9 percent were confirmed of re-engaging in extremist activity with another 10.7 percent suspected of doing the same.

"Mar 22, 2016","Every parent in the United States of America should be alarmed by this covert attempt by Board of Education members to essentially tell our kids that their power supersedes that of the parents. Furthermore, this reckless policy of placing same sex kids in bathrooms and locker rooms puts children in danger of being in private spaces with sexual predators and or sexual offenders Make sure to add your comments to the MI Board of Educations HEREMichigan s State Board of Education has drafted a guidance that would push the state s schools to allow all students, regardless of parental or doctoral input, to choose their gender, name, pronouns, and bathrooms.Spearheaded by board president John C. Austin and signed by state superintendent Brian Whiston, the guidance informs Michigan public schools that only the students themselves i.e. not their parents or doctors can determine what their individual gender identities are. The responsibility for determining a student s gender identity rests with the student. Outside confirmation from medical or mental health professionals, or documentation of legal changes, is not needed,  the guidance states.Gender identity is defined in the guidance as  a person s deeply held internal sense or psychological knowledge of their own gender, regardless of the biological sex they were assigned at birth. Notably, the guidance makes no mention of a student s age affecting whether or not they can pick a gender without their parent or doctor.In fact, the guidance seems to intentionally cut parents out of the process.The guidance states:  School staff should address students by their chosen name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, regardless of whether there has been a legal name change. Students can even ask to have their chosen name and gender  included in the district s information management systems, in addition to the student s legal name. But what about when school staff members are speaking with parents about their son or daughter?The guidance states that  Transgender and GNC [gender nonconforming] students have the right to decide when, with whom, and to what extent to share private information. Accordingly, the board makes clear,  When contacting the parent/guardian of a transgender or GNC student, school staff should use the student s legal name and the pronoun corresponding to the student s assigned sex at birth, unless the student or parent/guardian has specified otherwise. In other words, a boy named  Jake  could become a girl named  Jane  at school, seemingly without his parents ever knowing.Names, pronouns, and genders aren t the only things the board wants students to choose.The guidance informs schools that  Students should be allowed to use the restroom in accordance with their gender identity. And the board makes clear that single-stall bathrooms are not inclusive enough:  Alternative and non-stigmatizing options, such as an all-gender or singleuser restroom (e.g., staff bathroom or nurse s office), should be made available to students who request them, but not presented as the only option. Locker rooms also should become inclusive of students  many gender identities.  A student should not be required to use a locker room that is incongruent with their gender identity,  the guidance states.  Locker room usage should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the guiding principles of safety and honoring the student s gender identity and expression. Students who are bothered by having members of the opposite sex in their locker rooms can request  an adjusted changing schedule  or  use of a private area in the facility. The board quietly issued the statement and guidance on February 23rd, without a press release. The public has only until April 11th to comment on the proposed guidance, according to the Department of Education website. The board will finalize the guidance at a meeting on May 10th.

"Mar 23, 2016","January 2017 can t come fast enough for America, and for the rest of the world who is 100% FED UP with this freeloading, fascist loving family .For two days President Barack Obama has defied calls from Republicans to cancel his trip to South America and return home in the wake of the terror attacks in Brussels.And now it seems even his guests are sick of having him after dozens of human rights protesters took to the streets of Buenos Aires to demand he leave Argentina.But instead of departing Obama chose to carry on regardless this evening as he attended a glitzy banquet alongside wife Michelle, Argentine President Mauricio Macri and first lady Juliana Awada.The foursome were pictured arriving at the Centro Cultural Kirchner, named after Argentina s former Prime Minister and Marci s predecessor, in the country s capital this evening.The group paused for a photo opportunity on a red carpet with Obama and Marci dressed in suits and Michelle and Awada in glamorous evening dresses.From there they made their way into a leafy candlelit courtyard for champagne, where Obama was pictured clinking glasses with Marci. Meanwhile a few streets away human rights protesters were busy burning American flags and demanding Obama leave the country. The protesters accuse America of backing dictatorial regimes during the Cold War in South America, including in Argentina, and hold the U.S. responsible for the thousands who died or were disappeared under their rule.Today marks the 40th anniversary of the military coup in Argentina that ushered in one of the most oppressive dictatorships in Latin American history, which demonstrators argue makes Obama s visit particularly offensive.Earlier in the day, Obama sought to deflect criticism of his foreign travel in the wake of Belgium s terror attacks, saying the U.S. must show ISIS that it does not have power over its citizens.  We are strong, our values are right. You offer nothing, except death,  Obama said of ISIS.Gesturing in the direction of Argentinian President Mauricio Macri, who was standing to his left at a joint news conference this afternoon in Buenos Aires, Obama said,  It is important for the United States president and the United States government to be able to work with people who are building and who are creating things. We have to make sure that we lift up and stay focused, as well, on the things that are most important to us,  he said.  Because we re on the right side of history.  Via: Daily MailYeah right Barry.

"Mar 26, 2016","Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton came out in agreement with Donald Trump last week on our role in NATO. They disagree on a solution but it s a great idea and about time they bring this to the forefront. SENATOR TOM COTTON ON AMERICA S ROLE IN NATO:Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton on Friday discussed his participation in a meeting with Donald Trump earlier this week, remarking that he and the Republican presidential frontrunner have similar concerns when it comes to the United States  role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  You know, he had spoken earlier that day to The Washington Post editorial board and raised some serious questions about NATO. I share some of those questions,  Cotton said in an interview with MSNBC s  Morning Joe.   We used to split our costs 50/50 between the U.S. and Europe. Today, it s 70-30 between the U.S. and Europe.  Read more: PoliticoIn an interview with The Washington Post editorial board, Donald Trump made an accurate statement about the U.S. subsidization of fellow NATO members:TRUMP: Look, I see NATO as a good thing to have   I look at the Ukraine situation and I say, so Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we are doing all of the lifting, they re not doing anything. And I say, why is it that Germany is not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of the Ukraine not dealing with   why are we always the one that s leading, potentially the third world war, okay, with Russia? Why are we always the ones that are doing it? And I think the concept of NATO is good, but I do think the United States has to have some help. We are not helped. I ll give you a better example than that. I mean, we pay billions   hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries that are in theory wealthier than we are.DIEHL: Hundreds of billions?TRUMP: Billions.Trump s GOP opponents jumped on his comments and accused him of suggesting that the U.S. should leave NATO, or at least cut back its support of the alliance.In fact, Trump was correct that the U.S. is paying  hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries  via NATO each year, never mind additional military subsidies to non-NATO allies.In 2014, the collective GDP of all NATO members was US$37.5 trillion. During the same year, the alliance spent a total of US$924 billion on military expenditures, of which the U.S. spent the majority ($610 billion), according to the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database.Consequently, the alliance collectively spent 2.47% of GDP on defense. The U.S. was the only member above this value, coming in at 3.5% of GDP. In other words, the U.S. subsidizes each and every other member of NATO.This leads us to the following chart, showing the individual defense spending deficits toward the common defense in 2014 for each NATO member   note that the U.S. has a  surplus  of US$180 billion that equals the sum of all other member deficits.Unsurprisingly, Germany (US$47 billion per year) and Canada (US$26 billion per year) are the biggest NATO laggards, followed closely by Spain and Italy at $US21 billion per year each. These four countries constitute almost two thirds of the total NATO deficit that has to be covered by the United States.Trump had good instincts on this.Read more: American Thinker",DONALD TRUMP WAS RIGHT AGAIN: U.S. Funds NATO In The Hundreds Of Billions

CEO Mark Fields responded to Trump s criticism in a recent interview with CNN s Poppy Harlow. He said Ford is committed to adding jobs in the U.S.Last July, Trump blasted Ford for having manufacturing operations in Mexico.  What does that do? We don t get anything. Does Mexico come here and build factories here? We lose a fortune with every deal  that adds jobs overseas, Trump claimed.Fields defended Ford s track record on supporting American jobs.  We ve created 25,000 jobs [in the U.S.] since 2011, and going forward over the next four years we ve agreed to either retain or add another 8,500 jobs,  Fields said.  The amount of money that we invest in [research and development] here is more than companies like Apple. Ford invested nearly $7 billion in R&D in the U.S. in 2014 alone, Field said.The Republican presidential frontrunner s criticism of Ford largely centered around Ford s plans to invest $2.5 billion in its Mexican operations.Then in October, Trump took credit for Ford supposedly canceling those plans and opening a new factory in Ohio instead.In fact, Ford said it planned to go forward with its $2.5 billion expansion in Mexico.

"Mar 29, 2016","Americans had to know it would come to this. The anarchists, the whiny, petulant college students with nothing better to do and the angry BLM protesters are about to meet up with a group who doesn t care much about their feelings or about political correctness. A large percentage of bikers who belong to groups are veterans who have fought for our nation and are not about to step aside and allow a billionaire communist who supports a woman under investigation by the FBI and left four of their brothers to die in Benghazi, to take away the right of Americans to attend a political rally for a candidate they support.It s a military tradition of sorts, running back more than six decades.In the wake of World War II, as a generation of troops returned home from combat, veterans across the country found a certain pleasure and purpose through a newly evolved piece of gear they d become friendly with downrange: the motorcycle.New  motorcycle clubs  sprang up everywhere, filling the void of camaraderie and brotherhood   not to mention adrenaline and adventure   that many found themselves craving with the end of their military service.They called themselves  outlaws    not because they were criminals but because they refused to be boxed in by the rules and regulations of the fledgling American Motorcycle Association. Combat is where motorcycle outlaws come from,  says Don Charles Davis, who writes the Aging Rebel biker news blog from Los Angeles.  Clubs like the Boozefighters and the Outlaws were either invented or transformed by veterans on cheap Army surplus bikes. One club in particular drew its inspiration from the 3rd Pursuit Squadron of the Flying Tigers, the American volunteers who flew combat missions against the Japanese over China. The squadron was better known among the fliers as  Hells Angels. It was just the first of three waves of motorcycle club membership, Davis says. The second surge, of which the former II Corps artilleryman was a part, arose in the wake of Vietnam. Like many war fighters returning home to a largely hostile nation, he found his own family among bikers.That s when clubs such as the Mongols, the Devils Disciples   named after a George Bernard Shaw play about Revolutionary War patriot Ethan Allen, Davis says   and the Bandidos got their start, again largely fueled by returning veterans.And now a new generation of currently serving troops and veterans are pouring into the old clubs, and starting their own groups as well.

It s really overwhelming. I was not anticipating this kind of response,  Mittness said.While Mittness is working to have a peaceful protest that doesn t interfere with the Trump event, Janesville police are preparing for any possibility.Janesville Police Chief Dave Moore said Friday he didn t yet know how many officers would be assisgned, but his department reached out to police agencies in Rock County, including the sheriff s office, as well as the State Patrol, DNR and Dane County Sheriff s Office.The joint Beloit-Janesville-Rock County sheriff s  mobile field force,  which specializes in crowd control, will be there, Moore said.Moore noted the Janesville Conference Center holds 1,000 and said he expects  a substantial number of people  outside. Trump s event is scheduled for 3 p.m. The local protest is slated to begin at 11 a.m.Police respect the constitutional right to freedom of speech,  and to the degree possible, we intend to allow all citizens to voice their opinions, but we will require that it be done in a peaceful and safe manner,  Moore said.Inside the Janesville Conference Center a part of the Holiday Inn Express is a different story, Moore said.If the Holiday Inn, Trump s people or the U.S. Secret Service want disrupters removed,  It is private property, and that s their right,  Moore said.

It does sound far-fetched but just ask FOX News reporter James Rosen who was spied on by Obama. Yes, Barack Obama spied on Americans by using the excuse that it was  necessary  to expose the name of the person the NSA was spying on.

Sometimes the Americans  names were officially unmasked; other times they were so specifically described in the reports that their identities were readily discernible. Among those cleared to request and consume unmasked NSA-based intelligence reports about U.S. citizens were Obama s national security adviser Susan Rice, his CIA Director John Brennan and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch.Some intercepted communications from November to January involved Trump transition figures or foreign figures  perceptions of the incoming president and his administration. Intercepts involving congressional figures also have been unmasked occasionally for some time.The NSA is expected to turn over logs as early as this week to congressional committees detailing who consumed reports with unmasked Americans  identities from their intercepts since the summer of 2016.Read more: Circa News",SARA CARTER Uncovers Explosive Evidence Of Violations Of American Civil Liberties By Obama [Video]

"Mar 31, 2016","What a great example of how you should react to free speech respond back in kind. College students go off to learn and experience many different people and that means conservatives as well as liberals. The Emory University s President is right on with his response to the freakout over pro-Trump chalk drawings. Emory University President James W. Wagner chalked his own free speech message onto a campus sidewalk after students protested over pro-Donald Trump messages that they said threatened their safety.Students had petitioned the administration to denounce the pro-Trump chalkings that began appearing throughout the Atlanta campus last week, saying the possibility that fellow students could support Mr. Trump made them feel unsafe at school.Roughly 40 students carrying signs such as  Stop Trump  and  Stop Hate  protested outside of the Administrative Building last week, chanting  You are not listening! Come speak with us, we are in pain! Some students went so far as to disrupt a board meeting to ask that Mr. Wagner  decry the support for this fascist, racist candidate,  Campus Reform reported.On Friday afternoon, however, Mr. Wagner gathered on the quad with students from Emory s Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) to discuss the university s commitment to the First Amendment. A video posted on YouTube showed the university president using a piece of chalk to write,  Emory stands for free expression!  on the very same sidewalks where  Trump 2016  was written, Campus Reform reported.

"Mar 4, 2016","Because people who scale border walls and break the law to get into our country deserve the same taxpayer funded benefits as legal citizens right?Caving into the demands of the open borders movement and pro-immigrant Spanish media, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will refrain from enforcing immigration laws in areas of Flint, Michigan affected by a water crisis. The water amnesty is the latest of many reprieves issued by the Obama administration to help illegal immigrants nationwide. Judicial Watch has reported on many of them, including recent hurricane, earthquake, Ebola and  severe weather  amnesties.This one involves the widely reported water situation in Flint, which is located about 66 miles northwest of Detroit. Last year researchers discovered that the city s drinking water was contaminated with lead from decaying old pipes. The problem arose after a switch in 2014 in the city s water source to save money. Soon complaints mounted that the water smelled and looked strange and academic researchers discovered that it was toxic. This all occurred after a 7-1 vote by the Flint City Council to stop buying Detroit water and join a new pipeline project, according to a local news report.Now there s a state of emergency and the feds have stepped in, supplying the area with free bottled water and special filters to install at home until the local water supply is clean. For weeks immigrant rights groups complained that residents had to show identification to receive their free goods from the government and illegal aliens were being left out. National Spanish-language media outlets blasted the Obama administration for discriminating against illegal aliens. One reported that undocumented immigrants weren t getting help for fear of being deported, instead opting to drink contaminated water or pay out of pocket to buy some. Another major Spanish-language newspaper wrote that illegal immigrants and their children suffered lead poisoning and couldn t get clean emergency water because they didn t have identification cards.  When the National Guard went door to door distributing potable water, many were scared to open because they feared the uniformed persons were immigration agents who would deport them,  the paper wrote.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which claims to combat bigotry and protect civil rights for all, joined the cause expressing  horror  and  indignation  that the government denied undocumented immigrants free water and filters because they couldn t provide a photo ID or Social Security number. In a Spanish-language statement the group s Michigan chapter referred to news reports that Flint-area fire department stations distributing water were requiring identification. But even in places that aren t requiring ID, illegal immigrants are scared to come out and get their potable water out of fear that they will be deported, the ADL stresses in its announcement.  We are calling on the National Guard to order all fire departments and other centers distributing supplies that no one be rejected. Like a good lapdog the Obama administration obliged. This week DHS issued a statement in English and Spanish guaranteeing that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would not conduct enforcement operations at or near locations distributing clean water in Flint or surrounding areas.  Moreover, DHS officials do not and will not pose as individuals providing water-related information or distributing clean water as part of any enforcement activities,  the statement assures. The agency s priority is to support state and local government efforts to distribute clean water, the statement says, adding that DHS stands  ready to assist those in need.

"Mar 5, 2016","Only Hillary would go to Flint, MI to use the water crisis in a city run by Democrats to prop up her campaign. Americans should have known that with the extensive list of scandals in Hillary s past, there had to be a water pollution scandal. Well, as it turns out there is and it s a whopper!  Hillary Clinton has turned the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, into a central issue for her campaign and will look to capitalize on that focus when she faces Bernie Sanders at Saturday s Democratic debate in the troubled city, but in the 1992 Democratic primary, it was Bill Clinton who was on defense for standing by as Arkansas  water was polluted.Former senator Tom Harkin (D., Iowa) went after Clinton during a candidate forum that year for putting himself forward as an environmentalist even though Arkansas was an environmental disaster during his tenure as governor. Mr. Clinton, that was a very nice, flowery little speech, but we have to start reading the records and not the lips,  said Harkin, who went on to point out that Arkansas was rated last in environmental policy during his governorship.Here s video of the interaction:Harkin also said that Clinton s Environmental Protection Agency was  a joke  and that it was  loaded with representatives of the biggest polluter in Arkansas. That polluter was Tyson Foods, a powerful political backer of Clinton that contaminated the drinking water supply of more than 300,000 people with roughly 500,000 tons of chicken waste that was dumped into streams. The presence of  fecal bacteria  in the water caused entire towns near Tyson plants to be plagued by chronic dysentery and salmonella.In one case, it took Clinton 17 months after being notified by health inspectors that a Tyson plant was leaking 1 million gallons of sewage into a town s water supply to take any action.This turned into a major issue in the 1992 campaign, and not just for Clinton s opponents.After Clinton won his party s nomination, CNN sent a reporter to Arkansas to examine just how bad the environmental situation was.Here s video of the lengthy report:The report found that state agencies were aware that 3,700 miles of Arkansas waterways were at risk of being destroyed by  agricultural source pollution  and that it took Clinton until 1990 to create a task force to address the problem.One scientist who focused on the quality of Arkansas water expressed his belief to CNN that the only reason Clinton formed the task force was because of his presidential aspirations. I think there is a direct connection between the current emphasis on animal waste and runoff and his bid for the presidency,  said hydrologist Skip Halterman.Clinton is also criticized by CNN for giving a third of the seats on the task force to members of the poultry industry that was a major source of political contributions for Clinton.

Code-named  Vault 7  by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.The first full part of the series,  Year Zero , comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized  zero day  exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. Year Zero  introduces the scope and direction of the CIA s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of  zero day  weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple s iPhone, Google s Android and Microsoft s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force   its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency s hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA s hacking capacities.By the end of 2016, the CIA s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other  weaponized  malware. Such is the scale of the CIA s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its  own NSA  with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.CHINA IS ALSO GETTING IN ON THE ACT:","MASSIVE WIKILEAKS DROP Exposes CIA Spying via iPhones, Android Phones and Samsung TVs [Video]"
"Mar 8, 2016","There are no surprises with the results on the Republican side tonight. Michigan and Mississippi went for Trump.BUT the Democrat results coming in tonight are surprising for many reasons. The most shocking is that Bernie Sanders is leading Hillary Clinton in Michigan by a little over 3%:Clinton has maintained a double-digit lead in nearly all polls of Michigan, the party s second-biggest state in terms of delegates to vote so far. But Sanders has visited the state repeatedly in recent weeks, believing its economically hard-hit areas should be receptive to his message of combating economic inequality. If he can pull out a surprise victory, his campaign team believes, it will quiet the naysayers questioning his viability after Clinton s sweeping wins in last week s Super Tuesday contests. It would also allow him to argue that he s a truly national candidate, while most of Clinton s big victory s have been in the south.Another shocking item is that exit polls in Michigan said 60% of Democrats believe Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy Wow! That s a crazy exit poll!Michigan Presidential Primaries ResultsOverall Michigan Presidential Primaries Results Democratic 36.7% Reporting B. Sanders 51.7% 217,424 H.

Interesting because Hillary is losing to Bernie right now. Could those crossover votes been the demise of Hillary in Michigan?DETROIT   Hillary Clinton swept to a widely-expected early victory in Mississippi on Tuesday, but all eyes were on Michigan as polls started to close there at 8 p.m. and Bernie Sanders jumped to a small early lead.The Vermont senator   whose campaign has long seen Michigan as a strategically important state   held a tight margin over the former secretary of state, but very few results were in from Wayne County, the home of Detroit, where Clinton is likely to perform well. Clinton s victory in Mississippi, a heavily African-American southern state, was called as soon as polls closed, following the pattern set by her easy wins across the south starting with South Carolina in February. Bernie Sanders barely competed in Mississippi, choosing to focus on the other state voting on Tuesday.Neither Clinton nor Sanders were in Michigan Tuesday night, but their absence doesn t imply indifference. Both candidates have campaigned hard in the state   Sanders for the chance to gain ground on the former secretary of state, and Clinton to close the door on his candidacy with a win in a competitive, delegate-rich state.Initial exit polling in Michigan showed just over three-fifths of Democratic voters believed both candidates  policies are about right on the ideological scale, according to ABC News. About 60 percent of voters said Clinton was honest and trustworthy, versus about 80 percent who said the same of Sanders. And around 60 percent said honesty or empathy was the most important attribute for a candidate   slightly more than the four-in-10 who said electability or experience was most important.Read more: Politico",SHOCKING POLL RESULTS In Primary Victories Tonight

"March 1, 2016 ","(Reuters) - Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson signaled on Wednesday he was quitting the Republican presidential race, leaving three candidates facing Donald Trump as the party establishment struggled to find a way to halt the outspoken businessman. Carson, a conservative who briefly led opinion polls among Republicans earlier in the campaign, said he did not “see a political path forward” after performing poorly in this week’s Super Tuesday nominating contests. He said he would not participate in a Republican debate on Thursday. Despite a push by some mainstream Republicans to try to block Trump from winning the nomination, the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers will not deploy their $400 million political arsenal to attack him in the presidential primary campaign.        As a conservative black Republican, Carson, 64, stood out in the mostly white Republican Party, but his campaign foundered amid staff infighting and questions about Carson’s familiarity with foreign policy. His departure is unlikely to have a major impact on the fight among Republicans to become the party’s candidate in the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Reuters/Ipsos polling last month showed Carson supporters would mostly likely be split if he dropped out between Trump and U.S. Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas.  Trump consolidated his lead in the Republican race with a string of victories on Tuesday that moved him closer to    becoming the nominee. The 69-year-old New York real estate tycoon won seven states from Massachusetts to the conservative Deep South. His victories compounded the problem for a party whose leaders are critical of many of Trump’s positions and values and skeptical he can defeat the likely Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump has showered insults on rivals and is facing strong party disapproval over his ideas to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country. The 2012 Republican nominee, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, plans to deliver a rebuke of Trump on Thursday in a speech in Utah, sources familiar with his thinking said. It will be a high-profile display of establishment Republican unease. Romney’s speech comes on the same day that Trump and his  remaining rivals, Rubio, Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich share a debate stage in Detroit, hosted by Fox News. The Koch brothers, the most powerful conservative mega donors in the United States, “have no plans to get involved” in the Republican primary process, James Davis, spokesman for Freedom Partners, the brothers’ political umbrella group, told Reuters.         Donors and media reports have speculated that the brothers would launch a “Trump Intervention,” a strategy that would involve deploying the Kochs’ vast political network to target Trump in hopes of removing him from the race.   Trump has reached out to House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the most senior Republican in Congress. The Trump campaign contacted Ryan’s office late on Monday, a day before the speaker publicly admonished Trump over his failure to repudiate the backing of his candidacy by a white supremacist group. Trump responded with a warning to Ryan.     Among Trump’s rivals, Cruz, 45, won three states on Tuesday, bolstering the conservative senator’s argument that he has the best chance of stopping former reality TV star Trump. The Republican establishment’s favored 2016 candidate, Rubio, only won one Super Tuesday state, taking Minnesota. Anti-Trump Republicans have yet to coalesce around a single strategy to halt him, but the conservative group Club for Growth claimed credit for slowing Trump in some primary states by running attack ads. It said it would air a new advertisement in Florida as part of a $1.5 million ad buy. Some party donors - including hedge-fund manager Paul Singer and Meg Whitman, the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise chief executive - organized a phone call on Tuesday to get funding for an anti-Trump effort, The New York Times reported.  But one of Trump’s former rivals in the 2016 race, Mike Huckabee, admonished Republicans for not respecting the will of the voters. “The establishment Republicans are all bed-wetting over this and they don’t seem to understand that we have an election,” the former Arkansas governor said on Fox News. “Let’s remember that we have an election process, not a selection process.” Trump responded to the furor against him, saying in a tweet on Wednesday: “The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.” Trump later unveiled proposals for reforming U.S. healthcare that included repealing Obamacare, allowing prescription drugs to be imported, and turning the Medicaid program for the poor into block grants to states. Democrats pounced on the Republican campaign infighting.     Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid called Trump a “monster” the Republicans spawned with their years of rancorous opposition to all major Obama administration initiatives. “Republicans created him by spending seven years appealing to some of the darkest forces in America,” Reid said on the Senate floor. In the Democratic race, Clinton, 68, took big steps on Tuesday toward securing her party’s nomination, the 2016 campaign’s biggest day of state-by-state nominating contests. Clinton’s rival, U.S Senator Bernie Sanders, 74, won his home state of Vermont along with Colorado, Minnesota and Oklahoma.

"March 2, 2016 ","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Koch brothers, the most powerful conservative mega donors in the United States, will not use their $400 million political arsenal to try to block Republican front-runner Donald Trump’s path to the presidential nomination, a spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday. The decision by the billionaire industrialists is another setback to Republican establishment efforts to derail the New York real estate mogul’s bid for the White House, and follows speculation the Kochs would soon launch a “Trump Intervention.” “We have no plans to get involved in the primary,” said James Davis, spokesman for Freedom Partners, the Koch brothers’ political umbrella group. He would not elaborate on what the brothers’ strategy would be for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Three sources close to the Kochs said the brothers made the decision because they were concerned that spending millions of dollars attacking Trump would be money wasted, since they had not yet seen any attack on Trump stick.  The Koch brothers are also smarting from the millions of dollars they pumped into the failed 2012 Republican presidential bids of Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, the sources said.  Donors and media reports have speculated since January, when the Kochs gathered 500 of America’s wealthiest political donors at a California resort, that they would deploy their vast political network to target Trump. The Kochs oppose his protectionist trade rhetoric and hardline views on immigration - which include building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and deporting millions of illegal immigrants. Many Republican figures and business backers are eager to see Trump, a political outsider who has tapped into rising anti-establishment sentiment, fail in his bid for the nomination. They prefer instead a more traditional candidate like U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But with Trump racking up a series of wins in the early nominating contests against opponents including Rubio and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, there is a growing sense of inevitability that he will win the party’s mantle.

"March 3, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - India has denied visas for a delegation from the U.S. government agency charged with monitoring international religious freedom, the agency said on Thursday. The delegation from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom had been scheduled to leave for India on Friday for a long-planned visit with the support of the U.S. State Department and the U.S. embassy in New Delhi, but India had failed to issue the necessary visas, the commission said. “We are deeply disappointed by the Indian government’s denial, in effect, of these visas,” USCIRF chairman Robert  George said in a statement. “As a pluralistic, non-sectarian, and democratic state, and a close partner of the United States, India should have the confidence to allow our visit,” he said. George said USCIRF had been able to travel to many countries, including those among the worst offenders of religious freedom, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, China, and Myanmar. “One would expect that the Indian government would allow for more transparency than have these nations, and would welcome the opportunity to convey its views directly to USCIRF.” The Indian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last year, despite a much-heralded fresh start in U.S.-India ties under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the United States ran into problems arranging visits by the head of its office to combat human trafficking and its special envoy for gay rights. A U.S. State Department official referred queries on the visa issue to the Indian government, but highlighted remarks by President Barack Obama on a visit to Delhi last year, in which he made a plea for freedom of religion in a country with a history of strife between Hindus and minorities. In its 2015 report, the bipartisan USCIRF said incidents of religiously motivated and communal violence had reportedly increased for three consecutive years. It said that despite its status as a pluralistic, secular democracy, India had long struggled to protect minority religious communities or provide justice when crimes occur, creating a climate of impunity.  Non-governmental organizations and religious leaders, including from the Muslim, Christian, and Sikh communities, attributed the initial increase in violence to religiously divisive campaigning in advance of the country’s 2014 general election won by Modi.  The report said that since the election, religious minorities had been subject to derogatory comments by politicians linked to Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and numerous violent attacks and forced conversions by Hindu nationalist groups. U.S. law allows for imposition of sanctions on countries the commission terms “of particular concern,” but the USCIRF’s recommendations are not binding and these are not automatically imposed.

"March 4, 2016 ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court, two days after hearing a major abortion case from Texas, on Friday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law imposing regulations on doctors who perform abortions in a move that would allow two recently closed clinics to reopen. In a brief order, the court granted a request by abortion providers seeking to reinstate a lower-court injunction that blocked the Republican-backed 2014 law, which required doctors to obtain a formal affiliation with a local hospital. The abortion providers contend the law was designed to shut down abortion clinics by requiring hospital “admitting privileges” that are difficult for their doctors to secure. Louisiana will now have four clinics in total. The order noted that one of the eight justices, conservative Clarence Thomas, said he would have denied the application. The order said the court’s action was in line with its decision in June to temporarily block part of a Texas abortion law that was challenged by abortion providers in a high-profile case. The justices heard oral arguments in that case on Wednesday. The Louisiana law mandates that physicians who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the abortion clinic. The regulation matches one in the Texas law. U.S. District Judge John deGravelles in January granted a preliminary injunction sought by abortion providers, finding the law violated the constitutional right to an abortion established by the Supreme Court in 1973. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked that decision on Feb. 24, allowing the law to go into effect. The high court’s action sent mixed signals on how it might rule in the Texas case, in part because the justices previously allowed the Texas admitting privileges provision to go into effect. The action could suggest the court has greater concerns about admitting privileges requirements than were indicated during Wednesday’s argument in the Texas case. Friday’s move effectively put Louisiana’s law on hold while the justices prepare a ruling, expected by the end of June, in the Texas case. Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents abortion providers in both cases, welcomed the court’s action. “These underhanded tactics to cut off women’s access to safe, legal abortion simply cannot stand,” Northup said.  The Texas case also involves a separate provision that requires clinics to have costly, hospital-grade facilities. The Louisiana law was signed by Republican then-Governor Bobby Jindal in 2014.

At the University of California San Diego, however, the naked final exam is a requirement for a class in the visual arts department.Students are required to perform  a gesture that traces, outlines or speaks about your  erotic self(s),  according to the course syllabus. In the performance, all of the students are naked, along with the professor, Ricardo Dominguez, who has taught the class for 11 years. It s the standard canvas for performance art and body art,  Dominguez told local ABC News affiliate KGTV.  It is all very controlled If they are uncomfortable with this gesture, they should not take the class.  He was defending the class after one mother spoke out, claiming the requirement was not clear and was a  perversion. According to the UCSD Visual Arts department website, the course is a prerequisite for a verbal performance art class. Fully 95% of students in the class receive a grade of  A,  according to the college course ratings website koofers.com.Domniguez s biography on the department website lists a series of political efforts, including a government-funded project called the  Transborder Immigrant Tool,  in which he handed out cell phones to prospective illegal immigrants with instructions about how to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.The goal of the project, which was funded by U.S. government grants and UCSD, and which was subsequently investigated by Congress, was to use poetry to  dissolve  the border.Via: Breitbart News",MOTHER OUTRAGED OVER DAUGHTER BEING ASKED TO ARRIVE NUDE TO EXAM BY RADICAL COLLEGE PROF Whose Past Includes Aiding Illegals To Cross Border Into US
"May 10, 2016","One of the most interesting and insightful pieces you will read on the reason Americans are drawn to Trump Where did all the Trump voters come from, and where did the Cruz evangelicals go? One of the great mysteries of the 2016 primary is how so many assessments of the Republican electorate turned out to be wrong. The primary electorate that gave us Donald Trump as the presumptive nominee was dramatically different from the one that chose Mitt Romney in 2012.Jeb Bush thought there was a huge, quiescent moderate majority nostalgic for a return to the Bush era, or looking for a doggedly inoffensive candidate like himself, blessed with endorsements from all the right people and a campaign war chest so huge it was supposed to scare other candidates out of the race. Senator Rand Paul thought the GOP s libertarian moment had arrived, driven by young voters who were deeply concerned about privacy issues in the online era and weary of interventionist foreign policy under Bush and Obama alike. Senator Marco Rubio thought he had crossover appeal to every faction of the Republican Party and so much electability that GOP voters would be crazy to turn him down. Governors like Rick Perry and Scott Walker thought voters in other states would be impressed by their successful resumes.Most baffling was the miscalculation of Senator Ted Cruz, who was counting on a Southern conservative and evangelical firewall that should have made him an early front-runner. Cruz had every reason to think those voters were out there and every reason to suppose they would be unwilling to support Donald Trump, on both moral and policy grounds.Instead, Trump cleaned up with evangelicals, and his eventual victory in the primary was heralded by many observers as a death knell for  movement conservatism.  At the very least, we were told, conservatives were in such disarray that they couldn t unite around a candidate who could stop Trump, even though well over half the party didn t want him as the nominee.The alternative theory of Trump s primary victory is that he s bringing new voters into the Republican primaries, and it s clearly not just a few saboteurs looking to set Hillary Clinton up with her preferred GOP opponent.NBC News is the latest outlet to run a story on Trump bringing new voters into the GOP fold, noting that the 2016 Florida primary saw tens of thousands more votes cast than Mitt Romney s take in the 2012 general election, and the lion s share of the new votes went to Trump. In Establishment-friendly Northeastern races, Ohio Governor John Kasich pulled vote totals comparable to Romney s primary vote in 2012, but Trump s new voters swamped him.Sean Trende at RealClearPolitics suggested in January that neglected white working-class voters were coming back to the GOP after taking a pass on Mitt Romney in 2012. Trende described them as  mostly lower-income, blue-collar voters who lived in areas that had also voted for Ross Perot,  who had been turned off by  Mitt Romney s wealth and upper-class demeanor. Missing voter  theories abound after big elections, because so much of the eligible American electorate consistently chooses not to vote. With voter participation well under 60%, even in big presidential elections, the  missing electorate  is big enough to be a theoretical game-changer in virtually every race. It s arresting when a missing electorate returns, as Trende suggests is happening with Trump.Along the way, he makes the point that Ted Cruz was fundamentally wrong about who the missing voters were, as he frequently quoted analysts who misunderstood what Trende was saying in his 2012 election post-mortem.They weren t evangelicals miffed that Mitt Romney was a Mormon, or a moderate. The missing voters weren t mainly conservative Christians at all, since Trende notes that that cohort has always maintained a level of voter participation far above the national average. Many of the missing voters disengaged from politics long before 2012, and it s mostly because they didn t think either party had anything to offer them.The key to understanding this theory is to remember that Ross Perot brought a lot of disengaged working-class people into politics too, and besides his famous disdain for deficit spending, the big planks in his platform were opposition to illegal immigration and criticism of big trade deals, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement, which both Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush supported. In the second presidential debate in 1992, Perot famously spoke of  a giant sucking sound going south  to describe the effect NAFTA would have when American jobs went to Mexico.It s no surprise that Donald Trump is talking about NAFTA too, and getting a huge response at his campaign rallies, even as analysts on the Left and Right scratch their heads and wonder why he s talking about a  settled issue  from two decades ago after Bill Clinton signed it into law.To the missing voters, NAFTA has never been a settled issue, or a forgotten one. They re still hurting from the shift of jobs and opportunities out of the country. They were told not to worry about it, because new high-tech jobs with better pay and working conditions would replace the  jobs Americans just won t do  and then those jobs got sent overseas as well, or filled with H1-B visa workers.There is a line of argument from free trade enthusiasts that insists such policies are good for the country overall. We re told that controlling legal immigration, or even cracking down on illegal immigration could significantly damage the U.S. economy. These grand strategies overlook the fact that the people who have been getting clobbered for decades to provide this higher level of national prosperity are tired of being the designated losers. On both the Left and Right, there is anger from people who believe they have been exploited to make others wealthy. That s the fundamental argument of liberal ideology, but Republican leaders really should have noticed when a substantial number of their traditional constituents began feeling that way.These disaffected working-class people are especially weary of master plans that deliberately injure Americans for the benefit of big U.S. investors and foreign interests. That s why a willingness to speak frankly about immigration was such a powerful signal to the missing voters, a sign that Trump was aware of them, in a way that few other Republicans were.The core element of any fair deal for neglected American workers is the acknowledgement that America exists, and its government understands that it has a unique responsibility to American citizens. There is nothing inherently hostile or xenophobic about that understanding. The put-upon citizens of the most open and generous country in the world are tired of being insulted as selfish and hateful for insisting our national priority should be our nation.For decades now, our central government has asserted the wisdom and moral stature to pick  winners and losers.  Those assertions are especially loud from Barack Obama, but he wasn t the first to make them. The people who feel they ve been picked as losers, for generations, are tired of it.Trende talked about the shifting  priorities  of these voters, which could go a long way toward explaining why Cruz didn t get the support he was looking for in the South. It s not so much a question of those voters rejecting Constitutional conservatism, as their political priorities shifting to more immediate concerns.They re under attack by the federal government, and they want relief. Intellectual discourse on the Constitutional basis for freedom of religious expression has less political value when the federal government is sending a battalion of lawyers to escort men into the women s restroom. They still care about our future of unsustainable government debt, but their more immediate concern is getting the economy moving for their regions and income brackets again. Abstract discussion about the proper limits of government gives way to more concrete concerns: What will you do to bring the jobs back, nourish our wages back to health, and make us feel like something more than targets?Some of the blame for those errors is due to the Republican Party at large, which frittered away the Reagan legacy through both Bush presidencies, and allowed the Left to teach the masses what  capitalism  means. Reagan brilliantly redefined the relationship between American citizens and their government, but as soon as he was gone, the GOP allowed that new understanding to be erased, perhaps mistakenly convinced it was unnecessary to defend capitalism from socialism while the Soviet Union was busy collapsing into a pile of ashes.A gulf developed between Republican leadership and the voters they should be able to reach. Until now, they didn t realize how wide that gulf was. They didn t invest nearly enough effort in figuring out who the missing voters were or how to bring them back. On the contrary, the GOP leadership devoted more energy to stamping out the first sign of renewed political life from those disaffected Americans, the Tea Party movement. Instead of understanding who those people were, absorbing their strength into the Republican coalition, or really listening to what they were saying, the GOP Establishment set about marginalizing them. They didn t realize how much damage they were doing to themselves among people who were watching the fate of the Tea Party movement, without being active members of it. Exasperating signals were sent, and received.For entire story: Breitbart News ",GAME CHANGER: HOW TRUMP IS BRINGING BACK The “Missing Voter” The GOP Forgot About

Its appearance before the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva is the second review of the U.S. rights record, following the first in 2010.A string of countries ranging from Malaysia to Mexico pressed the U.S. to redouble efforts to prevent police using excessive force against minorities.

These events challenge us to do better and to work harder for progress through both dialogue and action,  he said at the session s opening. He added that the government has the authority to prosecute officials who  wilfully use excessive force,  and that criminal charges have been brought against more than 400 law-enforcement officials in the past six years.Several countries, including Brazil and Kenya, voiced concern over the extent of U.S. surveillance in the light of reports about the National Security Agency s activities.David Bitkower, a deputy assistant attorney general, responded that  U.S. intelligence collection programs and activities are subject to stringent and multilayered oversight mechanisms.  He added that the country doesn t collect intelligence to suppress dissent or to give U.S. businesses a competitive advantage, and that there is  extensive and effective oversight to prevent abuse. Faced with widespread calls for a moratorium on executions and a move to scrap the death penalty, Bitkower noted that it is an issue of  extensive debate and controversy  within the U.S. He pointed to  heightened procedural safeguards  for defendants prosecuted for capital offenses.Brig.

Specifically, the Clinton email investigation was held up by Comey standing in the way. One of the specifics of the investigation that hindered it was that the Clinton house was never searched. The FBI always does a search of a household in an investigation. The New York FBI agents working the case were livid at the stonewalling in the Clinton case. FBI agents are now lawyering up and speaking up to tell what they know This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have convened but was not. That is appalling,  an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision.  We talk about it in the office and don t know how Comey can keep going. DID ANYONE ELSE THINK THIS EXACT SAME THING:The agent was also surprised that the bureau did not bother to search Clinton s house during the investigation. We didn t search their house. We always search the house. The search should not just have been for private electronics, which contained classified material, but even for printouts of such material,  he said. There should have been a complete search of their residence,  the agent pointed out.  That the FBI did not seize devices is unbelievable. The FBI even seizes devices that have been set on fire. Another special agent for the bureau that worked counter-terrorism and criminal cases said he is offended by Comey s saying:  we  and  I ve been an investigator. The idea that the Clinton/e-mail case didn t go to a grand jury is ridiculous. According to Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova, more FBI agents will be talking about the problems at bureau and specifically the handling of the Clinton case by Comey when Congress comes back into session and decides to force them to testify by subpoena. People are starting to talk. They re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked to day to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away. The most important thing of all is that the agents have decided that they are going to talk.

A group of 15 heavily-armed masked gunmen kicked down the door of a Texas border home and opened fire without warning, in a home invasion that injured a 9-year-old boy and his 33-year-old mother.The assault took place in the morning hours, in a rural home near the border city of Harlingen. The gunmen kicked the door down and began shooting at random as soon as they arrived on the scene, Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio said in an interview with Breitbart Texas.The spray of bullets injured the woman and her child, but the woman s husband and other children were not harmed in the shooting, Lucio said. He classified the woman s injuries as minor, but the child remains at a local hospital, where he is listed in stable condition. During the robbery the gunmen yelled out  policia policia  which as we all know is the Spanish word for police,  Lucio said.Preliminary information suggests the robbers attacked the wrong house, as they did not take anything from the property. Sheriff s investigators are still working to identify the gunmen, who are believed to have arrived in at least three vehicles.According to Lucio, the family inside the home is not believed to have any relation to criminal activity, and were simply random victims.As previously reported by Breitbart Texas, home invasions along the Texas border are a different breed of crime, since they often involve gunmen with ties to Mexican drug cartels storming houses to steal drug loads, or abduct human trafficking victims from a rival crew.Via: Breitbart News",CONSEQUENCES OF OPEN BORDERS: 15 Heavily Armed Men Break Into Texas Border Home With 9 Yr Old Boy And Open Fire

The city would also issue a formal apology, create a permanent memorial recognizing the victims and ensure that eighth- and 10th-grade students attending Chicago Public Schools would be taught about the Burge case and its brutal legacy, cementing the scandal s role in city history.But as much as the proposal seeks to end a painful, controversial era   Emanuel said it would  close this book, the Burge book on the city s history    it is unlikely to stanch the flow of torture claims from victims. A Loyola University Chicago law school dean appointed by a Cook County judge has identified some 20 additional cases in which inmates may have been Burge victims. Other inmates who have made torture claims continue to fight to overturn convictions and win their freedom. And one lawsuit over the torture is pending.Already, this stubborn scandal has cost taxpayers about $100 million in lawsuit settlements, judgments and other legal costs, according to lawyers. It brings it much closer to closure, especially from the city s point of view,  said Flint Taylor, an attorney who has been pursuing the torture issue for decades and was one of the lawyers who negotiated the reparations package.  But it s not done and over.

He still collects a police pension.Burge did not return calls Tuesday to his home in Florida.But John  Jack  Byrne, Burge s former right-hand man, on Tuesday called the reparations deal a  scam perpetuated on taxpayers.

"May 15, 2016","There is no reason to believe the welfare of our veterans would be a priority for Obama after he leaves office, considering they were never a priority for the 8 years he occupied the White House.A charity group that helps homeless military veterans on Chicago s South Side says the city is trying to take control of the meager facility to make way for the restaurants, shops and other commercial venues that would complement the proposed Obama presidential library and museum.Group leaders said the RTW Veterans Center is the last privately-owned property on a stretch of S. King Boulevard near the proposed Washington Park site for the Barack Obama Presidential Center and that city building inspectors unexpectedly arrived last April to find an overwhelming 32 code violations at the facility. We don t appreciate being muscled out and put in the situation of having to negotiate from a position of despair,  facility center Director Jah Ranu Menab told FoxNews.com on Saturday.Menab thinks the University of Chicago, which is working with the Obama Foundation to bring the presidential center to the South Side, is also part of an apparent effort to ultimately force the facility into receivership.The fate of the veterans  facility   which officials say serves more than 3,000 meals monthly   may well be decided Tuesday, when officials return to Cook County Circuit Court for a hearing on the efforts to fix the building s problems.Menab admits that the facility is in disrepair, with some violations related to a fire hazard, rats  nests and raw sewage flowing onto the basement floor.However, he says the situation, which includes fines of $16,000 daily, looks like an attempted  land grab  and that the prestigious university, where Obama was a law professor,  exerts a tremendous amount of influence  over the city and its future.The university strongly denies any involvement in the city s dealings with the center and its building and on Friday issued the following statement: The mission of providing support for veterans is extremely important, and numerous University of Chicago community members have volunteered their time at the RTW Veterans Center. The university is not engaged in discussions regarding the center s property and has no plans to purchase it. Veterans  center co-founder Daniel  Doc  Habeel, a Vietnam War veteran, acknowledged Saturday that people associated with the university have indeed volunteered time. But he also expressed uncertainty about the university s involvement. The not-for-profit facility, which receives no government funding, cited in a press release Wednesday a history of building inspectors in other places forcing a worn-out building into receivership so a prospective developer is  eventually able to acquire the property without having to negotiate. The city says the fines are not being enforced and that the case landed in court because numerous 311 calls led inspectors to visit the facility, where they learned about the severity of the problems, including a structurally unsafe porch.

I am just thankful for every day that he s in office. I am so proud that he represents my country and I think he represents me   I think he represents the America that I know. Taylor, 67, is a recipient of the National Medal of Arts. The pop icon performed  America the Beautiful  at Obama s second inauguration in 2013.

He promised to give us a health care system, it s a work in progress, but he has put us on a road to that,  Taylor said.  I m so grateful for what he s done for gay rights and for the emancipation of gay people. Particularly from my point of view, I think that was so overdue and so important, and so important for America to be ahead of the curve on this. Taylor criticized Congress in Obama s defense. I ve never seen a Congress that has been so obstructive and so contrary and so committed to doing anything that will foul up this administration. I just think it s an absolute scandal that he has had so little cooperation,  he said.  So anyway, you hit a nerve and I ll go on forever. But I ll just say it a third time: Every day that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are in the White House is a day that I am thankful for. Obama isn t the only politician Taylor is supporting: The singer said he s on the Hillary Rodham Clinton train, too. And aside from the fact that she s a woman running, she s the right person.

Marco Rubio is now embracing Democrats  calls to open the federal checkbook and dole out billions of dollars in money to combat the Zika virus   and tacking it onto the debt.Mr. Rubio, whose home state of Florida is at risk of a serious outbreak, is co-sponsoring legislation to fully fund President Obama s nearly $2 billion emergency spending request, and blasted his fellow Republicans for being too stingy by demanding more proof and more controls.And Mr. Rubio, who is finishing out his first term then ditching the Senate at the end of this year, said if the new spending can be offset, that s fine. But he s also fine with tacking it onto the debt and leaving it for others to pay for.  In times of public health emergencies, just like natural disasters, we shouldn t delay acting while we figure out and try to agree on what we re going to cut from other parts of the budget,  he said in a floor speech last week.Mr. Rubio gives Democrats political cover as Congress prepares to fight this week over the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which health experts say hasn t had a breakout in the U.S. yet, but fear one is looming as the summer heats up.The House GOP released its own plan Monday that would allocate $622 million toward Zika, taking the money from existing Ebola money and elsewhere.Read more: WT",RUBIO Sides With Democrats On Giving A Whopping $2 Billion For Zika Virus Prevention

"May 17, 2016","If you re wondering about what s happening with the Democrats, here the lowdown. What s helping Hillary win the nomination in 2016 is exactly what helped Barack Obama beat Hillary for the nomination in 2008. Ironic, huh? The Democrats are pretty worried about what will happen at the convention when you have a fired up and pissed off group of rabid Bernie fans in one place. Riot anyone? Yes, the Dem convention could turn out to be a RIOT Hillary Clinton is not winning because of a conspiracy or wrinkle in the time-space continuum. Rather, she benefits from the rules Democrats play by. Bernie Sanders is on a roll. He s won the last two Democratic primaries and stands a good chance Tuesday of adding Oregon and perhaps Kentucky to his pile of victories.Yet Hillary Clinton is likely to continue her seemingly unstoppable march to the party s presidential nomination.How can that be?It s not a conspiracy, as some angry Sanders backers suggest, a result of dark magic or a wrinkle in the time-space continuum. Rather, it s the rules that Democrats play by   rules that now work to Clinton s advantage, even as they thwarted her candidacy eight years ago, when she lost a nominating fight to then-Sen. Barack Obama. Where do things stand in the Democratic race?It takes 2,383 delegates to win the nomination at the party s national convention this summer in Philadelphia. Entering Tuesday s contests, former Secretary of State Clinton has 2,240 delegates to Vermont Sen. Sanders  1,473.Who s won the most votes?Clinton also leads Sanders in that category. She has received more than 12.5 million votes, compared with 9.4 million for Sanders. That s a lead of more than 3 million votes, according to calculations by the website Real Clear Politics.Hillary Clinton is not winning because of a conspiracy or wrinkle in the time-space continuum. Rather, she benefits from the rules Democrats play by. With 10 contests left, is it possible for Sanders to overtake Clinton in the delegate count to win the nomination?It is theoretically possible, just as it is theoretically possible to drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco in less than two hours  provided you go 200 mph the entire way.Come again?Sanders must win close to 90% of remaining delegates to overtake Clinton. It s mathematically possible, but not realistic, given that Democrats award delegates on a proportional, rather than winner-take-all, basis. So even when a candidate   in this case Clinton   loses a contest, she won t walk away empty-handed.How does that work?Take last week s West Virginia primary. Sanders clobbered Clinton, 51% to 36%. But when delegates were divvied up, Sanders won 18 and Clinton 11. Adding in superdelegates, the results were much closer: Sanders walked away with 19 delegates and Clinton claimed 18. That means Sanders  landslide victory cut into Clinton s overall delegate lead by precisely one.What makes someone a superdelegate?They re not faster than a speeding bullet or able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Superdelegates are those who automatically get a seat at the Philadelphia convention and have the liberty to vote for whomever they please. The overwhelming majority are supporting Clinton.Who gets to be a superdelegate?Superdelegates are elected officials and other party leaders and activists. They include sitting Democratic governors and members of Congress, past presidents and vice presidents and former chairmen of the Democratic National Committee.Why does the party have superdelegates?Because Democrats have two competing impulses. On the one hand, they fancy their party a model of inclusiveness and egalitarianism. On the other, they want to win elections.What does that have to do with superdelegates?After the party was torn asunder by the Vietnam War   some Democrats believing Vice President Hubert Humphrey had been forced down their throats as the 1968 nominee   leaders changed the nominating system to give more say to voters at the grass-roots level. But after the landslide defeat of George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter in 1980, the feeling was some recalibration was needed, leavening the will of the people with the presumed wisdom of political insiders. Hence the birth of superdelegates.How many superdelegates are there versus plain old garden-variety delegates?About 15% of Democrats are free to back whomever they wish. Clinton leads Sanders among superdelegates 524 to 40.If you subtracted superdelegates, would Sanders overtake Clinton in the delegate count?No. She would still be ahead, 1,716 to 1,433.Read more: LA Times",HILLARY KEEPS LOSING So Why Is She Still Winning?

"May 18, 2016","The discussion Bret Stephens had with his 10 year old son, is one every parent should be having with the very generation who has the most to lose if socialism really is implemented in America. As parents, we re asked countless times by our children to explain ghosts, scary shadows on the walls, or some other imagined childhood fear. How many times however, do our children ask us to explain something that every American should truly fear? How many times do we have the opportunity to explain the reality of Socialism to our children?  We Applaud Bret Stephens of the Wall Street Journal for the brilliant way he explained Socialism to his son. We thank him for sharing it with his readers.Noah, my 10-year-old son, was reading over my shoulder a powerful story about the state of medicine in Venezuela by Nick Casey in Sunday s New York Times. We scrolled through images of filthy operating rooms, broken incubators and desperate patients lying in pools of blood, dying for lack of such basics as antibiotics. Dad, why are the hospitals like this? Socialism. What s socialism? I told him it s an economic system in which the government seizes and runs industries, sets prices for goods, and otherwise dictates what you can and cannot do with your money, and therefore your life. He received my answer with the abstracted interest you d expect if I had been describing atmospheric conditions on Uranus.Here s what I wish I had said: Socialism is a mental poison that leads to human misery of the sort you see in these wrenching pictures.The lesson seems all the more necessary when discredited ideologies are finding new champions in high places. When Venezuelan President Hugo Ch vez died in 2013, an obscure U.K. parliamentarian tweeted,  Thanks Hugo Chavez for showing that the poor matter and wealth can be shared. He made massive contributions to Venezuela & a very wide world. The parliamentarian was Jeremy Corbyn, now leader of the Labour Party.Up north, Naomi Klein, Canada s second-most unpleasant export, treated Ch vez as heroically leading the resistance to the forces of dreaded neoliberalism. Jimmy Carter mourned Ch vez for  his bold assertion of autonomy and independence for Latin American governments and for his formidable communication skills and personal connection with supporters in his country and abroad to whom he gave hope and empowerment. There are lesser names to add to this roll call of dishonor  Michael Moore, Sean Penn but you get the point:  Democratic socialism  had no shortage of prominent Western cheerleaders as it set Venezuela on its road to hyperinflation, hyper-criminality, water shortages, beer shortages, electricity blackouts, political repression and national collapse. Ch vez and his successor, Nicol s Maduro, gained prestige and legitimacy from these paladins of the left. They are complicit in Venezuela s agony.And so to the U.S. election, specifically the resolutely undead presidential candidacy of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Sanders campaign is no stranger to accusations that its brand of leftism is cut from the same cloth that produced Chavismo. Yesterday, one of Hillary Clinton s most prominent Super PACs attacked our campaign pretty viciously,  Mr. Sanders complained in September, noting that they  tried to link me to a dead communist dictator. The senator protests too much. As mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 1980s, he boasted of conducting his own foreign policy, including sister-city relations with Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua and Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union. On a 1985 trip to Nicaragua, he lavished praise on Daniel Ortega s communist regime Chavismo s older cousin. In terms of health care, in terms of education, in terms of land reform . . . nobody denies they [the Sandinistas] are making significant progress in those areas,  then-Mayor Sanders told one interviewer in 1985.  And I think people understand that and I think the people of Nicaragua, the poor people, respect that. If Mr. Sanders ever rethought or recanted those views, I m not aware of it.But the point isn t what Mr. Sanders may have thought of the Sandinistas in the 1980s or the Chavistas in the past decade. It s that the type of socialism that the senator espouses $18 trillion in additional government spending over the next decade, accusations that Wall Street is a criminal enterprise and the continuous demonization of  millionaires and billionaires is not all that different from its South American cousins.Democratic socialism whether Chavez s or Sanders s is legalized theft in the name of the people against the vilified few. It is a battle against income inequality by means of collective immiseration. It is the subjugation of private enterprise and personal autonomy to government power. Mr. Sanders promises to pursue his aims on the Scandinavian model, as if that was a success, and as if Americans are Scandinavians. It wasn t. We aren t. Bernie s Way paves the same road to serfdom that socialism does everywhere.That s a fact Americans might have learned after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. We didn t. Take the time to tell your kids what socialism is, and does, before they too feel the Bern.Via: Wall Street Journal",A YOUNG FATHER EXPLAINS SOCIALISM To His 10 Year Old Son…A MUST Read For Every American

The group claims it helps raise funds for the needy and provide food and shelter for activists.But according to a police report obtained by TheDC, the 33-year-old Wade was raising money in more explicit ways.He was arrested on April 25 at a motel where he resided in College Park, Md. Police say he was using the motel room to pimp a 17-year-old girl.He s charged with seven counts, including felonies for human trafficking. The charges carry sentences of up to 25 years in prison and a $15,000 fine. Wade posted $25,000 bond and left jail on April 27.Wade denied the allegations in an email to The Daily Caller. Formerly a stylist for Solange Knowles, the sister of Beyonce, Wade has been featured in numerous news articles about the Black Lives Matter movement. He was also invited by the White House earlier this week to a movie screening with other Black Lives Matter activists. Wade says he did not attend the function, which was on Tuesday.Last year, a team of Washington Post reporters, including Pulitzer Prize-winner Wesley Lowery, included Wade in a profile of Black Lives Matter activists who protested after the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson. According to the police report, an undercover officer with the vice intelligence unit responded to an ad on backpage.com, a website frequently used by sex traffickers and prostitutes. Holla at me. Quick stay specials tonight and tomorrow. Independent. Fun and sexy. Text me to set up an appointment???????  reads the ad, which listed the age of the poster as 23.The undercover detective contacted the poster to set up a meeting. The respondent informed him that the cost of services would be $100 for a half-hour and provided an address, which turned out to be a Howard Johnson Inn in College Park. A room number was also provided.When the undercover john arrived, a white female wearing only a towel answered the door and let him inside the room. After she attempted to initiate contact with the detective he informed her he was a police officer, and she ran out of the room. Members of the Vice Intelligence Unit described a male that was watching the Undercover Detective as he entered [room 412],  the report reads.Investigators reported that the teenager, who gave her age as 17, said that Wade was her  manager.  She called him  CJ. Wade, who used a passport to rent the Howard Johnson Inn room, was arrested and charged with sex trafficking. Police recovered three cell phones from him.The alleged victim told investigators that Wade knew she was a minor. She said that he told her he was not concerned about her age because  you only have 5 months left until you re 18 so I m not worried. She also told investigators that she provided all the money she was paid to Wade.In response to TheDC s request for comment, Wade claimed that a tenant at a temporary housing facility he was running as part of his charity  was involved in activities  that he did not know about. As this is a legal matter, I m not going into serious detail with you,  he said.He did claim, however, that he was unfairly arrested because he was  too trusting. Despite those claims, the police report suggests that there is evidence that Wade was the person who communicated with the undercover detective by text message.Wade issued a statement on Twitter after being contacted by TheDC in which he blamed conservative  trolls  for focusing on the case. He also said  I am confident that I will be cleared of the charges I am currently facing. I was forced to make this statement before I was ready to because of ongoing efforts by Twitter  trolls  to stop my work and the work of my organization,  he wrote. For the past two to three days,  trolls  have been actively baiting conservative news outlets to report on my arrest, amongst other vindictive things that they are actively working on. Wade also stated that the recent arrest is the second time he has been arrested after  helping someone else.  He did not provide details of the case, but a review of criminal databases shows he was charged with 3rd degree grand theft in Miami in January. Wade says he was not convicted in the case nor did he take a plea deal.

There never has been, and never will be, any political interference in any matter under my supervision in the United States Department of Justice.Before I discuss the events of the past two weeks, I want to provide some background about my previous relationship with former Director Comey. I have known Jim Comey since approximately 2002. In 2005, when Mr. Comey was Deputy Attorney General, he participated in selecting me to serve as a U.S. Attorney. As a federal prosecutor, he was a role model. His speeches about leadership and public service inspired me.On July 5, 2016, Director Comey held his press conference concerning the federal grand jury investigation of Secretary Clinton s emails. At the start of the press conference, the Director stated that he had  not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice . They do not know what I am about to say. Director Comey went on to declare that he would publicly disclose  what we did; what we found; and what we are recommending to the Department of Justice.  He proceeded to disclose details about the evidence; assert that the American people  deserve  to know details; declare that no  reasonable  prosecutor would file charges; and criticize Secretary Clinton.I thought the July 5 press conference was profoundly wrong and unfair both to the Department of Justice and Secretary Clinton. It explicitly usurped the role of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General and the entire Department of Justice; it violated deeply engrained rules and traditions; and it guaranteed that some people would accuse the FBI of interfering in the election.There are lawful and appropriate mechanisms to deal with unusual circumstances in which public confidence in the rule of law may be jeopardized. Such mechanisms preserve the traditional balance of power between investigators and prosecutors, and protect the rights of citizens.Director Comey attended the Maryland U.S. Attorney s Office training seminar on October 27, 2016, and gave a detailed explanation of his reasons for making public statements about the conclusion of the Secretary Clinton email investigation. I strongly disagreed with his analysis, but I believe that he made his decisions in good faith.The next day, October 28, Mr. Comey sent his letter to the Congress announcing that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email investigation. He subsequently has said that he believed he was obligated to send the letter. I completely disagree. He again usurped the authority of the Department of Justice, by sending the letter over the objection of the Department of Justice; flouted rules and deeply engrained traditions; and guaranteed that some people would accuse the FBI of interfering in the election.Before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, 2017, Director Comey testified under oath about his public statements concerning the Secretary Clinton email investigation. I strongly disagreed with his explanations, particularly his assertion that maintaining confidentiality about criminal investigations constitutes concealment. Nonetheless, I respected him personally.Former Department of Justice officials from both political parties have criticized Director Comey s decisions. It was not just an isolated mistake; the series of public statements about the email investigation, in my opinion, departed from the proper role of the FBI Director and damaged public confidence in the Bureau and the Department.In one of my first meetings with then-Senator Jeff Sessions last winter, we discussed the need for new leadership at the FBI. Among the concerns that I recall were to restore the credibility of the FBI, respect the established authority of the Department of Justice, limit public statements and eliminate leaks.On May 8, I learned that President Trump intended to remove Director Comey and sought my advice and input. Notwithstanding my personal affection for Director Comey, I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader.I wrote a brief memorandum to the Attorney General summarizing my longstanding concerns about Director Comey s public statements concerning the Secretary Clinton email investigation.I chose the issues to include in my memorandum.Before finalizing the memorandum on May 9, I asked a senior career attorney on my staff to review it. That attorney is an ethics expert who has worked in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General during multiple administrations. He was familiar with the issues. I informed the senior attorney that the President was going to remove Director Comey, that I was writing a memorandum to the Attorney General summarizing my own concerns, and that I wanted to confirm that everything in my memorandum was accurate. He concurred with the points raised in my memorandum. I also asked several other career Department attorneys to review the memorandum and provide edits.My memorandum is not a legal brief; these are not issues of law.My memorandum is not a finding of official misconduct; the Inspector General will render his judgment about that issue in due course.My memorandum is not a statement of reasons to justify a for-cause termination.My memorandum is not a survey of FBI morale or performance.My memorandum is not a press release.It is a candid internal memorandum about the FBI Director s public statements concerning a high-profile criminal investigation.I sent my signed memorandum to the Attorney General after noon on Tuesday, May 9.I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it.Finally, I want to address the media claims that the FBI asked for additional resources for the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. I am not aware of any such request. Moreover, I consulted my staff and Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, and none of them recalls such a request.END OF TRANSCRIPTThe White House has struggled since Comey s firing to explain the chain of events that led to it and who exactly made the decision. Trump said as recently as Thursday that he acted on a  very strong  recommendation from Rosenstein, but Rosenstein made it clear to Congress that he drafted his memo only after Trump told him of his plans to dismiss the FBI director.He said he did not intend for the document to be a finding of misconduct or a  statement of reasons  to justify the firing, but he added:  I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it. Via: NBC Chicago",Deputy Attorney General Doubles Down On Comey Memo: “I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it.”

"May 22, 2015","The Friday document dump today included 300 of the thousands of yet to be released Clinton e-mails. How convenient to release these on a holiday weekend. We re all being scammed in all this because these are the e-mails hand picked by Hillaries minions. We won t get to the truth because it was destroyed. This entire thing is smelling to high heaven The State Department released its first round of emails from Hillary Clinton s time as Secretary of State on Friday, offering a new look at her handling of the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.The roughly 300 emails, about 850 pages, are part of the 30,000 that she turned over to State from her private email server, which she used almost exclusively to conduct both private and public business during her time at State. They reveal a range of correspondence from Clinton, everything from policy briefs to scheduling requests to friendly exchanges with staff.White House press secretary Josh Earnest says the new emails  do not change in any way anyone s understanding  of what happened in Benghazi, and the State Department reiterated the same in a tweet. The emails we release today do not change the essential facts or our understanding of the events before, during, or after the attacks,  the department tweeted.Clinton herself commented on the release at a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Friday, telling reporters she was happy they were out but was waiting for more. It s beginning. I just would like to see it expedited, so we could get more of them out more quickly,  she said.Below, a collection of some of the most newsworthy tidbits from the emails:A supportive boss In one email, sent four days before Christmas in 2012, Clinton sent a note to her entire State Department staff, acknowledging a  challenging week.  She had fainted about a week prior and suffered a concussion, which prevented her from testifying before House and Senate committees on the attacks. We need to learn from the tragedy in Benghazi and make every possible improvement   and we will,  she wrote in the five-paragraph note.One day earlier, Clinton wrote in an email to two top aides headed to the Hill on her behalf:  I ll be nursing my cracked head and cheering you on as you  remain calm and carry on!' One of those aides, Tom Nides, hints that he s not entirely excited about the grilling.Clinton replies:  Well, what doesn t kill you, makes you stronger (as I have rationalized for years), so just survive and you ll have triumphed! In most emails, she s referred to simply as  H. Stress over Benghazi scrutiny One email hints at the scrutiny the State Department was facing over Clinton s response to the Benghazi attacks. In their remarks the day after the attack, both Clinton and President Barack Obama made reference to an anti-Muslim video that some intelligence initially suggested prompted the attacks, a claim that was later found to be mistaken.On Sept. 24, 2012, Jake Sullivan, Clinton s deputy chief of staff at State, forwards her a 24-page document compiling all of the statements she had made after the attacks, and reassures her that she was careful in her wording. You never said spontaneous or characterized the motives. In fact you were careful in your first statement to say we were assessing motive and method,  he says.Sullivan also writes:  The way you treated the video in the Libya context was to say that some sought to *justify* the attack on that basis. Advice on foreign affairs Clinton received advice on foreign affairs from a range of former advisers from outside of the department, including Sidney Blumenthal, the former Clinton White House aide who s drawn scrutiny for issuing over two dozen memos to Clinton on Libya while also advising businesses looking to break into post-Gaddafi Libya.The emails reveal that Clinton often read, commented on and forwarded Blumenthal s memos   which laid out information obtained from his own sources on the situation in Libya   to Sullivan. Blumenthal will comply with a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee on Benghazi this week after his role in advising Clinton emerged.In a September 2012 email, Burns Strider, a senior adviser and director of Faith and Values Outreach on Clinton s 2008 campaign, forwards her a post from CNN s Belief blog by Stephen Prothero titled  My Take: A deadly link between Islamic and anti-Islamic terrorists.  She typically forwards these to State Department aides.Libya security concerns In the years leading up to the attack covered by the emails, there were a number of hints at the decaying security situation in Libya   key sticking point for Republican critics of Clinton s performance at State. Many believe she ignored warnings that the security there was declining and showed poor judgment in failing to beef up protection for U.S. officials there.In June of 2011, Sullivan emailed Hillary warning of a  credible threat against the hotel that our team is using,  and told her security officials would be moving personnel to other locations.She received an update in 2011 from Stevens on how fragile the security forces were in the country. The police chief is a university professor who took on these police duties after the revolution. According to the police chief, there are only 3,000 police in the Benghazi area, down from 6,000 prior to the revolution. Many police simply did not return to their jobs after the revolution, as they feared retaliation, Another email, sent in February of 2012 by then Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz, warned of  concern here that continuing rivalries among the militias remains dangerous from the perspective of the havoc they can wreak with their firepower and their continued control of select turf. Congratulations and condolences on Benghazi In the days following the attacks, Clinton received a stream of condolences and congratulations from diplomats, lawmakers and world leaders on her handling of the situation.On Sept. 13, Clinton is forwarded an email from U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro, who says that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called him to offer  profound condolences  about the Benghazi attack.  He said Israelis know too well how difficult these moments are, and he wanted us all to know that Israelis stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us at such a difficult time,  Shapiro writes.Christian Brose, Sen. John McCain s national security adviser, emailed Sullivan on Sept. 12, 2012, the day Clinton gave a speech honoring those who died in the attacks, sending his boss s compliments.  What a wonderful, strong and moving statement by your boss. Please tell her how much Sen. McCain appreciated it. Me too,  he wrote.Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates also sent his condolences.Intelligence holes? One October 2012 email underscores the limits of U.S. intelligence. Clinton emailed senior aide Cheryl Mills asking about an NPR report on the attacks. I just heard an NPR report about the CIA station chief in Tripoli sending a cable on 9/12 saying there was no demo etc.,  she wrote.  Do you know about this? Thoughts on the media A transcript of an interview with Wall Street Journal Reporter Monica Langley was circulated among a few top aides with commentary from Philippe Reines, a longtime spokesman for Clinton.He declared the October 10, 2012, conversation as an  awesome interview.  But he went on to say that Langley violated Clinton s personal space, by moving her chair knee-to-knee with the secretary, comparing it to  the dental hygienist rolling around the floor to get the best access to your mouth depending on which tooth she was trying to get access to. I ve never seen a westerner invade her space like that,  Reines wrote. But he went on to describe the interview as  wonderful. One of the best interviews I ve ever witnesses. Wish it were on live TV.

"May 23, 2016","The biggest thing a president can do for the people is to protect them from an enemy. If you refuse to define the enemy then you really can t fight it correctly. Obama and Hillary Clinton have both repeatedly denied that we re at war with Islam and refused to name it ISLAMIC EXTREMISM. On the other hand, Donald Trump has defined the enemy and is ready to defend Americans from it by banning Muslims until we can  figure out what s going on . Our own FBI and DHS have stated that WE CANNOT PROPERLY VET THE REFUGEES COMING TO AMERICA. Yes, you would think Obama would be cautious like Jimmy Carter and other past Presidents have and ban Muslims. Noooo .Obama is doing just the opposite! He s flooding towns across America with Muslims!A Muslim ban is necessary and needs to happen ASAP!Gen. David Petraeus is now auditioning to become Hillary Clinton s vice presidential pick. There s really no other way to interpret his recent column in The Washington Post, slamming Donald Trump for proposing a temporary ban on Muslim immigration.Calling Mr. Trump s statements  hate speech,  Gen. Petraeus essentially argues that anyone who dares to tell the truth about Islamic terrorism will only incite more Muslims to become Islamic terrorists,  by telling Muslims that the United States is at war with them and their religion. That statement assumes that the overwhelming majority of Muslims from Dearborn, Mich., to Kuala Lumpur are illiterate, stupid and blind.Practicing Muslims understand their religion far better than we do in the West. They understand that no one has  hijacked  Islam, as the apologists would have it; but that groups of Islamists, from al Qaeda to the Nusra front to the Islamic State, are seeking to apply Islamic doctrine   Shariah law   in its entirety.You can t win a war if you don t know the enemy. Our enemy today is Islamic supremacism, those who seek to establish an Islamic caliphate with the ultimate goal of replacing our Constitution with Shariah law.Rather than sweep that reality under the table, Mr. Trump has recognized that we simply have no tools at present to deal with this threat, and that the first responsibility of the president is to protect the security of Americans.Just days after the San Bernardino shootings last December, we learned that the Department of Homeland Security had shut down an intelligence-based screening program that had identified the mosque that shooter Syed Farook attended as a recruitment center for jihadis.Screening programs like the one whistleblower Phil Haney had devised are precisely what we need. We also need better screening at airports and U.S. consulates around the world. But programs like this take time to devise and put in place.Critics often mistakenly accuse Mr. Trump of imposing a permanent ban on all Muslims because of their religion. But he understands that any screening program that profiles individuals because of their religion, ethnicity or nationality will overwhelm our national security system with masses of individuals who pose no threat to us at all.A better approach is the one adopted by Israel at Ben Gurion Airport, where Israeli screeners attempt to identify actual threats by focusing on behavior and activity, not religion or ethnicity.Ever wonder why the Israeli college kids doing the screening ask you where you were staying in Israel and what you were doing? Because they know all the hotels and how far they are from just about everything. If you say you were staying in a Tel Aviv beach hotel and were visiting family in Ramallah, they probably would ask you why you didn t stay in Jerusalem, which is much closer.How did you get back in forth? Did you know a taxi driver? What was his name? If you rented a car in Tel Aviv, which check point did you drive through to get into the West Bank? Did somebody tell you to go to a particular check point? And on and on.Even good legends eventually break down. And while this intense questioning at the airport is time-consuming and often annoying, the Israelis understand that if they make a mistake, people will die.I don t know what type of system our national security establishment will ultimately propose we put in place. But until we have one, we in the United States are ill-equipped at present to distinguish between a nonpracticing Muslim, or a Muslim who does not accept the supremacist doctrines of Shariah law, and one who does.The former pose no threat and are potential allies in the war against the Islamists. The latter pose an existential threat to America and must be utterly defeated.Read more: WT",HERE’S WHY TRUMP’S Muslim Ban Is Absolutely Necessary

Judicial Watch has been investigating it for years, specifically the huge amount of taxpayer dollars that go to  voluntary agencies , known as VOLAGs, to provide a wide range of services for the new arrivals. Throughout the ongoing probe Judicial Watch has found a striking difference on how government lawyers use an exemption, officially known as (b)(4), to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to withhold records. All the cases involve public funds being used to resettle foreigners on U.S. soil and Americans should be entitled to the records.The (b)(4) exemption permits agencies to withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person which is privileged or confidential. Depending on the government agency and the mood of the taxpayer-funded lawyers handling public records requests, that information is exempt from disclosure. In these cases, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) disclosed a VOLAG contract to resettle tens of thousands of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) that entered the U.S. through Mexico under the Obama administration while the State Department withheld large portions of a one-year, $22.8 million deal to resettle refugees from Muslim countries. Most of the UACs came from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and the Obama administration blamed the sudden surge on violence in the three central American nations. The agency responsible for resettling the minors and issuing contracts for the costly services is HHS.As a result of Judicial Watch s work HHS furnished records with virtually nothing redacted. Disclosed were employee salaries of VOLAGs contracted by the agency to provide services for the illegal immigrant minors, the cost of laptops, big screen TVs, food, pregnancy tests,  multicultural crayons  and shower stalls for the new arrivals. The general contract was to provide  basic shelter care  for 2,400 minors for a period of four months in 2014. This cost American taxpayers an astounding $182,129,786 and the VOLAG contracted to do it was government regular called Baptist Children and Family Services (BCFS). The breakdown includes charges of $104,215,608 for UACs at Fort Sill, Oklahoma and an additional $77,914,178 for UACs at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.HHS rightfully provided all sorts of details in the records, including the cost of emergency surge beds ($104,215,608) for just four months; food for the illegal alien minors and staff ($18,198,000); medical supplies such as first aid kits, latex gloves, lice shampoo and pregnancy tests ($1,120,400); recreation items such as board games, soccer balls and jump ropes ($180,000); educational items like art paper and multicultural crayons ($180,000); laptops ($200,000) and cellphones ($160,000). Hotel accommodations for the BCFS staff was $6,765,000, the records show, and the salary for a 30-member  Incident Management Team  was $2,648,800, which breaks down to $88,293 per IMT member for the four-month period. It was outrageous that the Obama administration spent nearly $200 million of taxpayer funds to provide illegal alien children with the types of extravagant high-tech equipment and lavish benefits many American families cannot even afford for their own children.This has become a heated issue for the government which may explain why other agencies aren t as forthcoming in providing specific figures, thus abusing the (b)(4) exemption. The State Department, for instance, redacted huge portions of records involving contracts with VOLAGs to resettle refugees from mostly Muslim countries. The files illustrate the disparate redaction treatment given by different government agencies to the same types of records. The State Department paid a VOLAG called United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) a ghastly $22,838,173 in one year to resettle refugees that came mostly from Muslim countries. Unlike HHS, the agency redacted information related to what the USCCB charged the government for things like furniture, personnel, equipment and other costs associated with contracts to resettle refugees. Why did one government agency hand over the same types of records that another agency claims are trade secrets? Judicial Watch is challenging the State Department s (b)(4) exemption and will provide updates as they become available.HHS and the State Department work with nine VOLAGs to resettle refugees and the voluntary agencies have hundreds of contractors they like to call  affiliates.  It s a huge racket that costs American taxpayers monstrous sums and Judicial Watch is working to pinpoint the exact amount. Besides BCFS and USCCB, other VOLAGs with lucrative government gigs to resettle refugees are: Church World Service, Ethiopian Community Development Council, Episcopal Migration Ministries, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, International Rescue Committee, U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Lutheran Immigration Refugee Services and World Relief Corporation.Via: Judicial Watch",THE SHOCKING REASON THE STATE DEPT IS HIDING Details of its Payments to Refugee Resettlement Contractors

"May 26, 2015"," Drawing Muhammad is not illegal under American law, but only under Islamic law. Violence that arises over the cartoons is solely the responsibility of the Islamic jihadists who perpetrate it. Because freedom of speech is under violent assault, the human rights advocacy group the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) has announced a new ad campaign to defend freedom of speech and stand up to violent intimidation kicking off in the nation s capital.I said in a statement:  Because the media and the cultural and political elites continue to self-enforce the Sharia without the consent of the American people by refusing to show any depictions of Muhammad or showing what it was in Texas that had jihadists opening fire, we are running an ad featuring the winning cartoon by former Muslim Bosch Fawstin from our Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas. Let the American people see what the cowardly press is censoring in accordance with the blasphemy laws under the sharia (Islamic law).The ad campaign has been submitted to the Washington, D.C. MTA to run on buses and train dioramas in the Foggy Bottom, Capitol South, Bethesda, L Enfant Plaza, and Shady Grove stations. Drawing Muhammad is not illegal under American law, but only under Islamic law. Violence that arises over the cartoons is solely the responsibility of the Islamic jihadists who perpetrate it. Either America will stand now against attempts to suppress the freedom of speech by violence, or will submit and give the violent the signal that we can be silenced by threats and murder. We cannot submit to the assassin s veto. It was the jihadis, not I, who made the cartoons a flash point. If we surrender on that point and stop drawing Muhammad, we ve established a precedent of surrendering to violent Sharia enforcement, and once established, we will be made to reinforce it again and again. Islamist government is a unique threat to free speech and libertyFreedom of speech is the foundation of a free society. Without it, a tyrant can wreak havoc unopposed, while his opponents are silenced.Putting up with being offended is essential in a pluralistic society in which people differ on basic truths. If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others.I added:  There is nothing about this cartoon that incites violence. It is within the established American tradition of satire. If America surrenders on this point, the freedom of speech is a relic of history. AFDI Vice President Robert Spencer stated:  Many people on both the Left and the Right are saying that we should do nothing to provoke Islamic fundamentalism. The immediate answer would seem to be that we should do nothing to provoke violent jihadis, that the prudent thing to do would be to avoid doing things that anger them. But if we did that, they would not they stop coming at us. Last September, an Islamic State spokesman boasted:  We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted. This is His promise to us; He is glorified and He does not fail in His promise. If we do not reach that time, then our children and grandchildren will reach it, and they will sell your sons as slaves at the slave market. In light of that, what is the point of asking whether or not we should provoke them? They re already provoked,  he continued.  A more useful question now is whether it is really productive and helpful to signal to them that we will acquiesce to their threats of violence and change our behavior accordingly, or whether we will instead signal to them that their violent threats are not going to frighten us into submission. The ads have been submitted to run on buses in Washington, D.C.AFDI stands for:The freedom of speech   as opposed to Islamic prohibitions of  blasphemy  and  slander,  which are used effectively to quash honest discussion of jihad and Islamic supremacism; The freedom of conscience   as opposed to the Islamic death penalty for apostasy; The equality of rights of all people before the law   as opposed to Sharia s institutionalized discrimination against women and non-Muslims.

The Clinton Foundation was nothing but a slush fund for these scumbags Sitting in a courtroom three years ago, after skipping out on a sizable legal bill, Hillary Rodham Clinton s youngest brother struck a reassuring tone: Don t worry, the money is coming. I deal through the Clinton Foundation,  Tony Rodham said, according to court transcripts uncovered by the New York Times. He gave his word that Hillary and Bill were setting him up with Haitian-government permits to build a $22 million housing development in the earthquake-stricken country. I hound my brother-in-law, because it s his fund that we re going to get our money from,  Rodham explained, promising a $1 million check once the Haitian-government paved the way, enough both to cover the outstanding legal fees and take his family to Disney World.The construction deal fell through, but Rodham managed to settle his debt. And the next year, he got another crack at making money in Haiti s heavily-regulated economy when he joined the advisory board of a company, VCS Mining, which was developing a gold mine on the island. He d met the company s CEO at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative.  I go to see old friends [at the meetings,]  Rodham told the Washington Post,  but you never know what can happen. From the moment the Clintons walked through the White House doors in January of 1993, Rodham has proven remarkably adept at harnessing their political horsepower for his personal gain. His schemes don t always pan out, and they have caused numerous headaches for Hillary and Bill. But Rodham s fortunes have always been tied to theirs, his bank account waxing and waning in time with the Clintons  political prospects. He may lack their sophistication, but to many observers, Tony is the unvarnished embodiment of the Clintons  decades-long dance with crony capitalism.Rodham sits atop of a pile of money acquired through a vast tangle of enterprises just a little less secret and complex than those of his sister and brother-in-law.  There s really no better definition of what this is,  says David Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United and a longtime Clinton foe.  This is a person who is not directly the principal, but he s the brother   or, in the 1990s, the brother-in-law   of the president, using these open doors of family to shake people down.

"May 29, 2015","I wonder how many government funded trucks will be following Mooch s kids this summer? Oh, that s right she s a  good  mom. There s no need for government intervention Government-sponsored food trucks will be stalking students this summer with the goal of giving out thousands of  healthy  free lunches officials don t trust parents to provide.Officials at St. Paul public schools recently announced they re working with the local food bank Second Harvest to dispatch a mobile food truck to expand locations offering students free lunches during the summer. Last year the district supplied 71 locations, and the truck will help to add another 10 to 15 in 2015, KSTP reports.The district s director of nutrition services, Stacy Koppen, said the truck will drive around to different locations between 10:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. to help feed the city s needy youngsters. The truck will track down students at  spots like suggested basketball courts or fields where kids like to play,  according to the news site.The very expensive-looking specially rigged step van features a billboard with grinning teens alongside the message  Kids and teens: Get your free meals here.  The district apparently didn t offer the details on how the new program is financed, or how much the truck cost, and the news station didn t bother to ask. School officials said the truck will be manned by volunteers.Koppen said the district serves 29,000 lunches a day during the school year, but only 6,000 a day during the summer, so officials reasoned a truck is necessary to make sure students aren t starving. Time and again, we such a steep decline that we wonder,  Where are these children going? Are they getting the healthy, nutritious food they need for their health and academic success?  Koppen told KTSP. We want to make sure that when children return to school for the next school year, that they are at the optimal health status and that they are ready to learn,  she said, adding that the free food is available to all, not just low income kids.Minneapolis Public Schools have used food trucks to give away lunches since at least 2013. The Hopkins district in Minnesota, as well as districts in Colorado, New York, Massachusetts, Indiana, California, Tennessee, and other states have also launched trucks to take free food to students during the summer.In New York City, organizations can also apply to have school food trucks deliver meals to students on site upon request.Most, if not all, of the school food trucks seem to be funded at least in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as part of the federal free and reduced-price school lunch program. Each summer, the United States Department of Agriculture reimburses school districts for all meals prepared and served at no cost to any child under the age of 18,  the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel reports.The news site explained that School District 51 expanded its free summer lunch program to dispatch a food truck to patrol local neighborhoods and seek out students. The USDA will pay for food and staff labor but not for the purchase of a food truck or the cost of running it,  according to the Daily Sentinel.In District 51, the cost of the truck and expenses are covered by a $50,000 grant from the Western Colorado Community Foundation.Via: EAG News",WHY TAXPAYER FUNDED FOOD TRUCKS PLAN TO STALK KIDS THIS SUMMER

There seems to be a universal trend toward more surveillance and more surveillance that impacts Americans  privacy without obtaining a warrant  -Lawyer for the ACLU During his final year in office, President Barack Obama s team significantly expanded efforts to search National Security Agency intercepts for information about Americans, distributing thousands of intelligence reports across government with the unredacted names of U.S. residents during the midst of a divisive 2016 presidential election:Barack Obama s top aides routinely took advantage of rules their boss relaxed starting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism, espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats. Dozens of times in 2016, those intelligence reports identified Americans who were directly intercepted talking to foreign sources or were the subject of conversations between two or more monitored foreign figures.The data, made available this week by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, provides the clearest evidence to date of how information accidentally collected by the NSA overseas about Americans was subsequently searched and disseminated after President Obama loosened privacy protections to make such sharing easier in 2011 in the name of national security. A court affirmed his order.The revelations are particularly sensitive since the NSA is legally forbidden from directly spying on Americans and its authority to conduct warrantless searches on foreigners is up for renewal in Congress later this year. And it comes as lawmakers investigate President Trump s own claims his privacy was violated by his predecessor during the 2016 election.Read more: Circa ",NEW DATA RELEASED: OBAMA ADMIN “Accidentally Collected Info” On Americans During Election

"May 31, 2015","With 25% of Mexico now living in America Americans should be demanding our  President  tell us why he allowed these illegal aliens to cross our southern border and who will pay for their health care and education? Americans pride ourselves on being people who have a government. But these days, it more often seems as if we ve got a government that has people.And that government is even selecting who its people will be, having within a generation essentially imported a state s worth of new people through immigration.Since 1970, the number of  Hispanics of Mexican origin  in the U.S. has jumped from fewer than 1 million to more than 33 million. If all these Mexicans were a state, it would be the second largest in population in the country, trailing only California.Did you vote to approve that immigration policy? Did anyone? In fact, the federal government allowed it to happen without any voter input. That s by design.In recent years, Congress has attempted to draft legislation to deal with illegal immigration. And while the controversial  Gang of Eight  bill passed the Senate in 2013, it died in the House after one of its authors withdrew his support. Immigration is a difficult topic, one that will require difficult discussions.Instead, the Obama White House would prefer to short-circuit the political discussions. America cannot wait forever for them to act. That s why today I am beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress,  President Obama warned last summer. After the November elections, he acted to grant amnesty to millions of illegals.In February, a federal judge put a hold on that policy while he determined its legality. The administration admits it went right on ahead, issuing 2,000 more waivers. Now, an appeals court has upheld the stay. But the White House says it will press ahead. [T]he administration s enforcement priorities, including our focus on deporting felons and not families, and many other executive actions on immigration continue to move forward,  White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters this week.  It would be a shame if an issue so critical like this became mired in a political dispute. But Schultz has it exactly backward. If our representative system of government means anything, it should mean that the people have a say in the big issues facing our country.It s precisely because the issue is so important that it deserves to be a subject of political disputes. It s through the political process in the presidential and congressional elections of 2016 that voters can finally have a say in the nation s immigration policy. We ve already waited far too long.Via: Breitbart News ",DEATH OF A NATION BY EXECUTIVE ORDER: Who Voted To Bring 33 MILLION Immigrants To America?

He repeated accusations that Clinton misled the victims  families over what incited the attack. She lied to the family members, period,  Paronto said.

Yes, these are the people we re dealing with. Let s hope they finally get to the bottom of SOMETHING The Washington Examiner reports:The House Intelligence Committee has issued seven subpoenas as part of its ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including one seeking information about Obama s former national security adviser Susan Rice, and her activities related to intelligence documents that named members of the Trump campaign.The Journal s report said the intelligence-related subpoenas are to  seek information on requests  for the unmasking of names by Susan Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan, and United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power.Having subpoenas directed at former members of the intelligence committee could show that Republicans have strengthened their resolve to track down leaks from within the intelligence gathering agencies, such as the leak that described the contents of a phone call between Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.Susan Rice has been a target on the unmasking for some time so this should be very interesting. Let the games begin!FLASHBACK: SUSAN RICE REFUSES TO TESTIFY: Susan Rice just announced she won t testify before the Senate on the Russian hacking.Senator Lyndsey Graham said he s  very disappointed  but said,  we ll deal with her later. She gave a very flimsy excuse for not testifying via her lawyer:Rice considered the invitation a  diversionary play  to distract attention from the investigation into Russian election interference, including contacts between Trump allies and Russians during the campaign, the source said.That s ridiculous!

"May 5, 2015","We re not sure which of Judge Mary Murguia s qualifications for becoming a U.S. Supreme Court Justice would be more attractive to Obama. Could it be the fact that she, like Barack Obama can claim she is responsible for dismissing charges against a terrorist?  Perhaps her it s her sister s connection as a leader of La Raza, a government funded, radical activist group fighting to defend amnesty in America. Knowing Barry, it s likely both.The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge who previously dismissed terror charges against one of the Garland, Texas shooters has a connection to the controversial activist group, National Council of La Raza.Judge Mary Murguia, appointed by President Clinton and considered a potential nominee to the Supreme Court by President Obama, was the judge who dismissed government charges against Elton Simpson for suspected terrorism in 2011. On Sunday, Simpson attacked a free speech event in Garland, Texas depicting the Prophet Muhammad in cartoons.Daniel Greenfield cites evidence from the 2011 case:The FBI knew that Elton Simpson, one of the Garland Jihadists, was a threat and had attempted to lock him up after amassing evidence that he intended to go to Somalia as a terrorist. They had him on tape stating  that Allah loves an individual who is  out there fighting [non-Muslims]  and  If you get shot, or you get killed, it s [heaven] straight away.  Mr. Simpson then said  [Heaven] that s what we here for so why not take that route? Judge Murguia held then that the government was unable to prove Simpson mentioned violent jihad in his reasoning for traveling to Somalia.  That phrase is one made up by the Government, likely because it is aware that jihad in the Muslim religion does not necessarily imply violence,  she said, noted Greenfield.However, the LA Times previously noted that Judge Murguria s twin sister Janet Murguia leads a controversial group known as National Council of La Raza, which has been criticized as a racist hate group. It is the nation s largest Latino civil rights activist organization. La Raza is closely linked to the Obama Administration s amnesty efforts.Human Events, a conservative blog, previously reported that the mainstream media views La Raza  no more than a Hispanic Rotary Club.  But La Raza collected roughly $15.2 million in federal grants in 2005. Human Events also reported that undisclosed amounts of that money were used in  get-out-the-vote efforts supporting La Raza political positions. La Raza has been added to congressional hearings and  an anonymous senator even gave the Council of La Raza an extra $4 million in earmarked taxpayer money, supposedly for  housing reform,  according to Human Events. Moreover, Judge Murguria s brother, Carlos Murguria, helped coordinate the Immigration Amnesty Program prior to Clinton nominating him also for a judgeship, according to Front Page Magazine.Via: Bretibart News",RADICAL LEFTIST WHO DISMISSED CHARGES AGAINST MUSLIM TERRORIST SHOOTER IS POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT NOMINEE

The bill easily passed out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee 19-1. Obama would like to see that bill move sooner rather than later.  Congress, led by your congressional delegation, needs to act in a bipartisan fashion, do their job, make sure Flint has the necessary resources,  Obama said Wednesday in a speech in Flint.President puns it like ME, calls small-government philosophy  corrosive : The president used the speech to broadly attack the conservative philosophy of less-government-is-good-government, saying an anti-government attitude was at the root of the problems in Flint.  I do think that part of what contributed to this crisis was a broader mindset, a bigger attitude, a corrosive attitude, that exists in our politics and exists in too many levels of our government,  he said.  It s a mindset that believes that less government is the highest good, no matter what. Boos for Snyder, but not from Obama: Gov.

"May 6, 2015","Chuck Norris wrote about Jade Helm 15 in a commentary for the conservative website WND last weekend, pointing to the decision of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to have the Texas State Guard monitor the Pentagon s Jade Helm 15 military ops as evidence that the operations as a potential threat to the state s sovereignty.  Governor Abbott wrote:  During the training operation, it is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed.  And Abbott is demanding  regular updates on the progress and safety of the Operation. Norris fanned the conspiracy flames by writing:  Concerned Texans and Americans are in no way calling into question our brave and courageous men and women in uniform. They are merely following orders. What s under question are those who are pulling the strings at the top of Jade Helm 15 back in Washington. The US government says,  It s just a training exercise.  But I m not sure the term  just  has any reference to reality when the government uses it. A covert training operation by U.S. military special operations personnel, Jade Helm 15, is taking place in a several states this summer, spreading panic and conspiracy theories as to the true purpose of the mission.The two-month simulation spans much of the Southwest, requiring special forces from four branches of the military to carry out covert operations amid  hostile  territory in Texas, Utah and part of California.In at least one of those states, hostility toward the operation has begun a few months early. Online and at in-person meetings, many Texans have expressed suspicion and outright opposition to the project. Some are understandably worried about how it ll affect their daily lives, while conspiracy theorists claim it s an attempt to institute martial law.The military says that they are merely preforming training exercises to help hone soldiers  skills in the event they face a foreign threat, but some citizens are worried that planners have something more domestic in mind.Events for the exercise are outlined in a map among unclassified documents posted online last month. Army sources have verified to The Washington Post that the map is legitimate.Many have speculated that the American government isn t far from declaring martial law, an idea only bolstered by these training exercises.In an anonymous email sent to Dave Hodges at The Common Sense Show, a self-described Texas Ranger said that train cars outfitted with prison-type shackles have been moving about Texas. While he added that the Department of Homeland Security claimed the train cars were for transporting captured terrorists, he was apparently reluctant to believe them. He wrote: We have been told by Homeland that these trains are slated for transporting captured terrorists, non-domestic. We are not sure we can trust this explanation because Homeland is keeping a lot from us and we are growing increasingly uncomfortable with their presence in Texas.  The paranoia about Jade Helm, which started on websites like Alex Jones s InfoWars, had started with familiar fulmination about a mass seizure of firearms or a cover-up for American  death squads. This week, Texas Governor Greg Abbott asked the Texas state guard to monitor the exercise for any violations of freedom.  It is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed,  said the governor.Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said Saturday that he d been hearing concerns about Jade Helm 15, and reached out to the Pentagon for answers. My office has reached out to the Pentagon to inquire about this exercise. We are assured it is a military training exercise. I have no reason to doubt those assurances, but I understand the reason for concern and uncertainty, because when the federal government has not demonstrated itself to be trustworthy in this administration, the natural consequence is that many citizens don t trust what it is saying.  The Texas Senator, speaking at the South Carolina Republican Convention went on to say: I understand a lot of the concerns raised by a lot of citizens about Jade Helm. And I think part of the reason is we have seen, for six years, a federal government disrespecting the liberty of the citizens. That produces fear, when you see a government that is attacking our free speech rights, or Second Amendment rights, or religious liberty rights. That produces distrust.   Just because you re paranoid,  said Cruz,  doesn t mean they re not out to get you. Via: TPNN",IS JADE HELM 15 REALLY ABOUT MARTIAL LAW? Texas Ranger Relays What He Saw Inside Military Trains

"May 9, 2016","Open borders Ryan might be in for a shock when his GOP competitor, businessman Paul Nehlen gives him a run for his money in what should have been a  safe seat  for him in November.  After the Paris terrorist attack, House Speaker Paul Ryan declared that the United States cannot turn away the hundreds of thousands of Islamist migrants now being approved for visas to enter the United States. Ryan declared that it is not  appropriate  to consider the religious attitudes of would-be migrants seeking admission.After the San Bernardino terrorist attack, Ryan echoed President Obama in condemning what was described as Donald Trump s  religious test.  However, a Breitbart News investigation now reveals that while Paul Ryan wants no  religious test  for who gets admitted into America, Ryan sends his children to a private school that uses a  religious test  in its admissions process.Ryan sends his children to a Catholic school connected to the parish where he was an altar boy as a child.Breitbart News reached out to the school as a perspective applicant and obtained a copy of the school s 2015-2016 registration papers and tuition contract. The document inquires specifically into the applicant s religious background   in particular, it asks whether the applicant is a parishioner at the associated Catholic parish. The school recruits through the parish by offering a tuition discount to those who have been baptized and are members of the parish.The registration form defines what qualifies as a parishioner:A  parishioner  as defined for the purposes of this contract and the attached Addendums is a person who:Is officially registered at  [this] Catholic Parish Has had their children baptized; Fulfills the Sunday Mass obligation and other Holy Days of Obligation; Offers consistent financial support (whether weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually) through the church offertory envelopes or direct deposit for a minimum of $800 per calendar year; Volunteers service to the parish; and Participates in parish ministries when asked, or if they feel called to share their talent of time. Instead of doing an explicit ban on Muslim students, Ryan s school applies a religious tax on non-parishioner students   thereby creating a two-tiered system for students and their families depending upon whether or not they are parishioners. The registration form explains that  the cost to educate a child at [this] School for the 2015-2016 school year is $4,673.00.  The school charges non-parishioner families a rate that is higher than the cost of educating the child:  For families who do not have at least one parent or guardian who is a parishioner, a minimum of 4,900 tuition per child will be expected. By contrast, parishioners pay less than the cost to educate one child   paying only  a minimum of $1900.00 tuition per child  plus an additional parish contribution of $800   i.e. a total of $2,200 less per year than what is owed by non-parishioners. Parishioners even receive the recruitment incentive of free pre-kindergarten.By signing the contract, parents agree that the tuition they pay  is considered an investment in the Catholic education of my child. As the registration forms explain, the school exists for the express purpose of helping to foster Catholic children:[This] school is a Catholic School established and subsidized by the members of [this] Parish, Janesville, Wisconsin for the purpose of assisting Catholic parents in fulfilling the responsibility to raise their children in the Catholic faith.Therefore, as the school s website explains, the  school primarily serves children of parish families  and non-parishioner families are welcome  as space allows. While Muslim students could presumably get into Ryan s school, the school s reliance on the parish as a recruiting center and the above-cost tuition fees would, by definition, function as a mechanism for screening them out. When Breitbart News spoke to a school representative about the school s religious diversity, the representative said that no student currently enrolled wears a headscarf, even as Paul Ryan s migration policies increasingly introduce this new element into other families  schools.Moreover, in addition to the school s religious tax in the form of higher tuition for non-parishioner students, the school also requires a certain degree of assimilation from its non-Catholic students: namely, if a non-Catholic student is admitted, she must participate in the school s religious functions, which include regular faith-based courses.If the U.S. had an immigration policy that resembled the admission policy of Speaker Ryan s school   i.e. it recruited migrants from churches and synagogues overseas and offered discounted migration to people who attended churches and synagogues   although a Muslim migrant could theoretically get in, the effect would be to substantially reduce Muslim migration and increase Christian and Jewish migration relative to it   a policy which Ryan finds reprehensible for the country, but ideal for his kids  school.While Ryan chooses to insulate his children in an academic environment that considers religion in its admissions process, he has been adamant that the American people are not entitled to be similarly selective about who comes into their country to live as their neighbors, receive their tax dollars, fill public university slots, demand affirmative action, or potentially radicalize against their own country.Days ago, Speaker Ryan even announced that he could not yet support Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton, after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee selected by Republican voters. Several candidates   Lindsey Graham, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, and Marco Rubio   all ran on Ryan s platform and lost by immense margins. Similarly, Mitt Romney also ran on the Ryan platform and lost in a landslide, as did Eric Cantor in his own Congressional District.Reports have previously noted that one of Ryan s central disagreements with Trump stems from Trump s pledge to enact a temporary pause on Muslim migration   a policy Speaker Ryan publicly denounced even though, according to exit polling data, seven in ten GOP Wisconsin voters support Trump s plan.Trump s proposal  is not what this party stands for. And more importantly, it s not what this country stands for,  Ryan said in December.In the next eight months, the U.S. will issue more visas to Muslim migrants than the number of GOP voters in Ryan s district.Yet, not only does Ryan oppose the temporary migration pause, he has pushed to expand Muslim migration. Ryan has a two-decade long history to pushing to expand immigration rates and has championed legislation that expanded Muslim migration. Last December, Ryan ushered his omnibus spending bill through Congress, which funded visa issuances for nearly 300,000 Muslim migrants, temporary and permanent, over a 12-month time span.In an interview with Sean Hannity in November, Ryan said that he does not support any kind of  religious test  for determining who is admitted entrance into the country   even if the would-be migrants believe that  women can t drive [and] can t be seen in public without a male relative. I don t think a religious test is appropriate. That s not who we are,  Ryan said.  I don t think it s the appropriate test. However, as Andrew McCarthy has previously explained, the U.S. law does, in fact, require a religious test when it comes to making considerations about visa issuances.Ryan grounded his attack of Trump s plan to pause the admission of Muslim foreign citizens on the first amendment right of U.S. citizens.  Freedom of religion is a fundamental Constitutional principle. It s a founding principle of this country,  Ryan said.However, as Sen. Jeff Sessions has explained   contrary to a previous declaration Ryan has made   the role of a U.S. lawmaker is to represent U.S. citizens, not foreign nationals living in foreign countries. As such, Sen. Sessions explains that our first amendment protections extend to U.S. citizens, and not to foreign would-be migrants all around the globe. In his remarks arguing against an amendment offered by Sen. Patrick Leahy and supported by Senate Democrats that would move towards creating a global right to migrate, Sessions said:There are 7 billion people in the world. Choosing who can immigrate into the United States is, by definition, an exclusionary process. The goal is to select immigrants for admission based on the benefits they provide to society  In the United States, we have protections against discrimination by religion, age, disability, country of origin, etc. We have freedom of association. Rights of due process. Now imagine extending these as part of our immigration system. The logical extension of this concept results in a legal regime in which the United States cannot deny an alien admission to the United States based upon age, health, skill, family criminal history, country of origin, and so forth  If we say it is improper to consider religion, then that means it is improper for a consular official to even ask about a candidate s religious beliefs when trying to screen an applicant for entry. It would mean that even asking questions of a fianc  seeking a visa about his or her views on any religious matter   say on the idea of pluralism vs. religious supremacy   would be improper, because if it is improper to favor or disfavor a religion, it is improper to favor or disfavor any interpretation of a religion  Are we really prepared to disallow, in the consideration of tens of millions of applications for entry to the United States, any questions about religious views and attitudes? A U.S.-born citizen who subscribes to theocratic Islam has a freedom of speech that allows him to give a sermon denouncing the U.S. constitution or demanding it be changed.

Godspeed Fred Thompson, a former U.S. senator from Tennessee, GOP presidential candidate, Watergate attorney and actor who starred on the television drama  Law and Order,  died on Sunday in Nashville. He was 73.Mr. Thompson died after a recurrence of lymphoma, according to a prepared statement issued by the Thompson family. Mr Thompson, who had recently purchased a house in Nashville to return to Tennessee, was first diagnosed with cancer in 2004. It is with a heavy heart and a deep sense of grief that we share the passing of our brother, husband, father, and grandfather who died peacefully in Nashville surrounded by his family,  the Thompson family s statement reads. Fred once said that the experiences he had growing up in small-town Tennessee formed the prism through which he viewed the world and shaped the way he dealt with life,  his family said.  Fred stood on principle and common sense, and had a deep love for and connection with the people across Tennessee whom he had the privilege to serve in the United States Senate. He enjoyed a hearty laugh, a strong handshake, a good cigar, and a healthy dose of humility. Fred was the same man on the floor of the Senate, the movie studio, or the town square of Lawrenceburg, his home. ]Here is Fred Thompson explaining  Federalism.

"Nov 1, 2016","Hillary Clinton was reportedly drunk at a rally in New Jersey according to several sources but you be the judge: Rumors of Hillary Clinton s chronic alcohol use have been swirling around the politician for years, but have proven especially rampant this campaign season with the focus and national debate on the Democrat s lingering health issues. And for good reason. Wikileaks recently released an email chain where her aides talked of sobering up the Democratic presidential candidate.An Aug. 2015 email from communications aide Jennifer Palmieri instructs campaign chairman John Podesta to locate and sober Hillary up so that she can return or respond to documents that were emailed to her hours before. I think you should call her and sober her up some,  Palmieri said.The Wikileaks email chain between Palmieri and Podesta shows that Clinton was not reachable throughout the entire afternoon on Aug 8. Additionally, other emails released by Wikileaks and Judicial Watch indicate Clinton sleeps well into mid afternoon on many days and as secretary of state, overslept and missed key national security meetings and daily briefings.New York Times national reporter Amy Chozick covered the Clinton s vicious primary campaign in 2008 against Barack Obama. In a 2015 profile for ABC News about Clinton, Chozick said she was surprised how much booze Clinton swilled on the campaign trail. Chozick said: Hmm. She likes to drink.

"Nov 1, 2017","DC lawyer Victoria Toensing is one smart cookie. She s representing a former FBI informant who has evidence on kickbacks and bribery involving the transportation of uranium in the US. She recently told Sean Hannity her client will brief Congress about Russian involvement in the U.S. uranium market. This includes widespread bribery and actions that involved the Clintons I m not going into detail,  attorney Victoria Toensing said on the Oct. 24 Hannity.  You know that, Sean. But the informant will give an overview and specific conversations that he had with Russians in what they were thinking about the money that they were spending. I mean, let me just be that general and it involves the Clintons. The director of the FBI at that time was Robert Mueller, and he is now the special counsel investigating alleged Russian collusion with the 2016 Trump campaign. The undercover investigation involving Toensing s client occurred between 2009 and 2014, and the senior attorney on the case was Rod Rosenstein, who is now the deputy attorney general of the United States and the official who appointed Mueller as special counsel.Further, all this information indicates that many senior Obama administration officials knew about instances of bribery and money laundering involving at least one Russian official, at a time when Russia wanted to expand its uranium market in the United States, and when the administration through a special committee had to approve or deny the sale of a company, Vancouver-based Uranium One, to Rosatom. (Rosatom is the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation.)Some of the people on that Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States included then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Attorney General Eric Holder, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napalitano, and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.The committee approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom in October 2010. That sale gave Russia, and President Vladimir Putin, control over 20% of U.S. uranium production. (At least nine investors in Uranium One   prior to, during, and after that sale   donated $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.) So, Mueller, [Rod] Rosenstein, maybe even [James] Comey at the time, and the president of the United States   certainly Eric Holder was the head of the DOJ   they all knew that they had all this evidence that the Russians had infiltrated with the purpose of a criminal enterprise to corner the market on uranium, the foundational material of nuclear weapons?  asked Hannity.Toensing said,  That is correct.

"Nov 10, 2015","It looks like it s safe for everyone to pack up their little victim tents and head back to the dorms Something stinks at the University of Missouri.A reported incident of vandalism at Mizzou sparked university-wide protests, a boycott by the school s 4-5 football team, and eventually the resignation of the university s president and chancellor.There s only one problem: no evidence of the alleged incident, in which a poop swastika on the wall of a dormitory restroom was reported, has ever been made publicly available. Did this incident occur as reported, or was it an immaculate defecation that formed the foundation of an unimaginable deception?According to Billy Donley, the president of Mizzou s Residence Halls Association (RHA), the poop swastika was reported at approximately 2:00 a.m. on October 24, 2015. On Saturday, October 24th, at 2:00am an individual came into one of the restrooms in Gateway Hall and drew a swastika on the wall with their own feces,  Donley wrote in a letter several days after the alleged incident.  This event happened while many students, including myself, were already asleep. Later in his letter, Donley noted that he only founded out about the alleged vandalism incident  via a flyer posted on the walls  of the dorm.Although Donley did not respond to repeated requests for comment prior to publication, The Federalist spoke with two RHA staffers while trying to get in touch with Donley. Neither had personally witnessed the poop swastika. When asked if there was any photographic evidence of the alleged incident, one staffer replied,  Not to my knowledge. Frankie Minor, the director of residential life at Mizzou, did not respond to repeated requests for comment on whether he personally saw the poop swastika or any photographic evidence of it.The Federalist also attempted to contact Christian Basi, the associate director of the University of Missouri News Bureau, who previously told the Columbia Missourian on Oct. 30 that the incident had been immediately reported to Mizzou police. Basi did not respond to requests for comment prior to the publication of this article.Calls to the University of Missouri Police Department, which responded to and investigated the alleged poop swastika incident, also failed to yield any evidence of the poopstika.Multiple activists on Twitter pointed to this photo as proof that the incident occurred as reported, but a Google search for the same image shows that it has been floating around the Internet for nearly a year. A reddit thread from November of 2014 appears to contain the earliest publication of the photo in question, meaning that it most certainly does not constitute proof of the incident alleged to have occurred at Mizzou on October 24, 2015.Maj. Brian Weimer, the public information officer for the Mizzou police department, told The Federalist that he also did not personally see the poop swastika that was reported to police. When asked if anyone in the police department personally witnessed the swastika, Maj. Weimer clammed up and referred all questions about the incident to the university s custodian of public records.The Federalist also repeatedly contacted @ConcernedStudent1950, the Twitter account representing Mizzou protesters who issued a series of demands of university administrators after the alleged poop swastika incident made headlines. The individuals running the @CS1950 account failed to produce any photographic or documentary evidence of the incident prior to publication of this article.While a mere absence of evidence is not synonymous with evidence of absence, the complete lack of any verifiable photographic evidence of the alleged poop swastika and the lack of any named eye witnesses raises serious questions about the veracity of a racially charged incident of vandalism that eventually led to the resignation of the University of Missouri s two top administrators.Did the incident happen as reported, or did two university administrators resign over protests that were sparked by a hoax? And if the incident did happen as reported, a proposition for which no publicly available evidence currently exists, how did university administrators and law enforcement authorities confirm that the vandalism was driven by racial animosity, as opposed to being promulgated as a public relations stunt meant to tar the university for failing to provide an environment free of racist invective? It would not be the first time a public university fell victim to a high profile PR stunt that was later revealed to be a fabrication. Either way, students, their parents, university employees, and Missouri taxpayers deserve solid, verifiable answers based on clear evidence about what exactly transpired in that Gateway Wall bathroom in the early morning of October 24.Under the provisions of Missouri s broad public records laws, The Federalist has requested from the University of Missouri copies of any and all records relating to the alleged vandalism, including any police or incident reports describing the investigation of the poop swastika by law enforcement authorities, as well as any photographic records of the alleged swastika, and will make that information available if and when it is received from university officials.

"Nov 11, 2015"," The question is not how Hillary will ever be able to repay the kindness of so many donors to the Clinton Slush Fund/Clinton Charity the question is how will America survive her pay-backs?According to donation records, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation   which funds global vaccine distribution   has donated at least $26 million to the Clinton charity, though records appear to be incomplete so the amount could be higher.On Thursday, a week after former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates argued for amnesty and for an unlimited number of high-tech guest-worker visas, Microsoft announced it would slash 18,000 jobs. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella promised his employees that  we will go through this process in the most thoughtful and transparent way possible.  Analysts told USA Today that the number being let go was  larger than expected. The  vast majority  of employees will reportedly be notified  within the next six months  and  earn severance and job transition help in many locations.  Microsoft employs 125,000 people.Bill Gates, along with Sheldon Adelson and Warren Buffett, advocated removing  the worldwide cap on the number of visas that could be awarded to legal immigrants who had earned a graduate degree in science, technology, engineering or mathematics from an accredited institution of higher education in the United States. However, numerous nonpartisan scholars and studies have determined that there is a surplus   not a shortage   of American high-tech workers. Moreover, after a recent Census report found that  74% of those with a bachelor s degree in these subjects don t work in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) jobs,  the mainstream media may finally be catching on and taking away the high-tech industry s  free pass.  CBS News, for instance, concluded that the Census data suggest the high-tech industry s contention that there is a shortage of American high-tech  is largely a myth. Ron Hira, a public policy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has  said there are 50% more graduates than job openings in the STEM fields.  Microsoft s announcement hammers home his point that the IT sector has often been  an area of social mobility,  and removing the caps on high-tech guest-worker visas would take jobs away from American workers and make it more difficult to climb the economic ladder. You ve got people who come from working-class backgrounds who go into these sectors,  Hira said on a conference call of scholars earlier this year that Sen. Jeff Sessions'(R-AL) office organized.

"Nov 11, 2016","Trump began a more targeted outreach to Catholics after hiring Catholic Steve Bannon of Breitbart.com to be his campaign chairman, releasing a message to Catholics over the weekend promising to fight for Catholics  values.In what the Wall Street Journal is calling  one of the biggest upsets in U.S. political history,  Donald Trump won the presidential election with 290 electoral college votes to Hillary Clinton s 232. Not only did he win the electoral votes by a wide margin, he secured the Catholic vote by margins larger than those enjoyed by any Republican candidate in the last five elections.Leading into Election Day, polls had Trump leading Clinton with Catholics as many as 20 points, with the November 3 IBD/TIPP poll showing 54 percent of Catholics would vote for Trump as opposed to only 34 percent for Clinton. Although that margin began decreasing towards Tuesday, the final results show more Catholics voted for Trump than for his opponent.A Pew Research poll compares the numbers, and shows that Trump won the Catholic vote by a 7-percent margin   larger than that enjoyed by George W. Bush in 2004, the last time more Catholics favored the Republican candidate over the Democrat.A CNN national exit poll shows that, of the 23 percent of voters who identified as Catholic in this election, 52 percent voted for Trump, while only 45 percent voted for Clinton.Compare the numbers with the 2012 race between Obama and Mitt Romney, where 25 percent of voters were Catholic and 50 percent of that number voted for Obama as opposed to 48 percent for Romney. The margin was even wider in 2008, where 27 percent of voters were Catholic, with 54 percent of them supporting Obama over only 45 percent for Republican hopeful John McCain.Read more: Church Militant",THE NUMBERS ARE IN: Here’s How The Catholics Voted In This Historic Election

"Nov 12, 2015","The USPS is drowning in debt, has lost every one of its life-lines and has mismanaged its funds for decades. No worries though, the US Postal Union is quite certain Socialist Santa Claus will fix everything Presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won the endorsement of the American Postal Workers Union on Thursday, giving the self-described democratic socialist a boost as he seeks more support from organized labor in the Democratic primary.APWU represents 200,000 U.S. Postal Service employees and retirees. It s the second major national union and member of the AFL-CIO labor federation to endorse Sanders over rival and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.Sanders  stands above all others as a true champion of postal workers and other workers throughout the country,  said Mark Dimondstein, the union s president, in a statement. The endorsement came from the union s 13-member executive board.The United States Postal Service (USPS) lost $5.5 billion last year. That is the eighth annual loss in a row and the third-highest ever. The only silver lining is that the loss was below the red-ink tsunami of $15.9 billion in 2012.Why does the federal government deliver the mail? Why does it have a monopoly over delivering the mail?Admittedly, the Postal Service is one of the few government programs with actual constitutional warrant. The Constitution authorizes Congress to establish post offices. And early American politicians rushed to take advantage of their opportunity, creating the Post Office Department in 1792.With politics rather than service as the post office s priority, Congress took the next step and approved the Private Express Statutes, which prevented anyone from competing with the government in delivering first-class mail. And Uncle Sam enforced his monopoly, fining would-be competitors, including celebrated libertarian author Lysander Spooner.The feds continue to prosecute anyone with the temerity to compete with the USPS, even threatening the Cub Scouts for once offering to deliver Christmas cards.Believing that Americans existed to serve the USPS left the system ill-equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. In 1971, Congress turned the Post Office Department into the semi-independent USPS. That removed its direct role in politics, but the USPS still is exempt from taxes and regulations, including local parking restrictions. Congress retained its control over postal policies and, of course, preserved the system s delivery monopoly.But banning competition could not preserve the postal market. The number of pieces of mail peaked in 2001 and continues to fall despite a rising population. Mail pieces dropped from 213 billion in 2006 to 155 billion last year, and the number is expected to decline to 130 billion by 2020. The USPS s last profitable year was 2006. Since then, losses have run between $2.8 billion and $15.9 billion. The Postal Service has maxed out its borrowing from Uncle Sam and missed four retiree program payments. With characteristic understatement, the Government Accountability Office observed,  Given its financial problems and outlook, USPS cannot support its current level of service and operations. The postal unions insist that nothing is wrong   at least, nothing that a federal bailout wouldn t solve. They reserve particular ire for the requirement that the USPS prefund workers  retirement. Had this rule not been in place, noted former postmaster general Patrick Donahoe, the Postal Service would have earned money last year.But prefunding protects taxpayers. Washington s unfunded (government) retirement liability is about $800 billion and growing every year. That no other agency is required to prefund is unfair to taxpayers, not the Postal Service, since every agency should have to set aside sufficient money to fulfill its financial promises. With the Postal Service earning too little to pay and with nothing left of its federal credit line, the USPS has defaulted four times over the last three years on its mandated contributions.Sanders has long been a vocal backer of a robust postal service, particularly during the postal reform debate of recent years. APWU views itself as fighting a battle against postal service privatization, and it counts the Vermont senator as perhaps its leading defender.As the postal service bleeds millions in losses   mostly due to unique funding mandates placed upon it by Congress   Sanders has staunchly opposed the closure of postal facilities and cuts in postal service, such as Saturday delivery. He is also a leading proponent of the concept of postal banking, which would allow post offices to provide small loans and compete with payday lenders. Postal banking is a top issue for APWU, and Sanders has sought to make it a campaign issue.In his statement, Dimondstein noted Sanders  long history of standing with workers on picket lines, as well as his support for a national $15 per hour minimum wage. Sanders spoke at a protest against Verizon last month that was held by the Communications Workers of America union, and he joined a Fight for $15 rally outside the U.S. Capitol building earlier this week.Via: Huffington Post ",GOVERNMENT SANTA CANDIDATE Gets Another Huge Endorsement… Just In Time For Christmas

After the Hayride broke the exclusive story on 10,000 Syrian refugees possibly resettling in Baton Rouge, Lafayette and Metairie, it has now come to light that refugees are already coming into the New Orleans area.Catholic Charities, which receive federal grants from U.S. Department of State/Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, have apparently taken in two Syrian refugee families already and are expecting many more.There are approximately 180 cities in the country that are eligible to accept the 10,000 Syrian refugees. Here is the full list of those cities, which includes Baton Rouge, Matairie and Lafayette:US Refugee Public Affiliate DirectoryThen, once the refugees arrive in the country, they could be dispersed across the 180 cities listed above, where they are to aided within the first 30 to 90 days in settling and finding employment in the area.After approximately 90 days, refugees are no longer eligible for the State Department-funded support that they were receiving through migrant and refugee services. However, they are able to join support programs through the Department of Health and Human Services.Additionally, it is unclear how much the screening process for the 10,000 Syrian refugees will cost American taxpayers.WIDESPREAD WELFAREHowever, the narrative by the national media tends to be one where immigrants and migrants are portrayed as coming to America and not taking any sort of federal government help. In our research, we found that to be the biggest fallacy of all when it comes to the immigration and migrant issue.In a report by the Congressional Office of Refugee Resettlement, nearly 92 percent of refugees in the country were on food stamps between 2008-2013. Additionally, 73 percent of refugees were on Medicaid, 68 percent were receiving some kind of cash welfare almost 20 percent were in public housing.As Americans continue to debate what to do about the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East, this analysis attempts to estimate the costs of resettling refugees from that region in the United States. Although we do not consider all costs, our best estimate is that in their first five years in the United States each refugee from the Middle East costs taxpayers $64,370   12 times what the UN estimates it costs to care for one refugee in neighboring Middle Eastern countries.The cost of resettlement includes heavy welfare use by Middle Eastern refugees; 91 percent receive food stamps and 68 percent receive cash assistance. Costs also include processing refugees, assistance given to new refugees, and aid to refugee-receiving communities. Given the high costs of resettling refugees in the United States, providing for them in neighboring countries in the Middle East may be a more cost-effective way to help them. Via: The HayrideAmong the findings of this analysis:On average, each Middle Eastern refugee resettled in the United States costs an estimated $64,370 in the first five years, or $257,481 per household.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has requested $1,057 to care for each Syrian refugee annually in most countries neighboring Syria.For what it costs to resettle one Middle Eastern refugee in the United States for five years, about 12 refugees can be helped in the Middle East for five years, or 61 refugees can be helped for one year.UNHCR reports a gap of $2.5 billion in funding that it needs to care for approximately four million Syrians in neighboring countries.The five-year cost of resettling about 39,000 Syrian refugees in the United States is enough to erase the current UNHCR funding gap.The five-year costs of resettlement in the United States include $9,230 spent by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) within HHS and the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) within the State Department in the first year, as well as $55,139 in expenditures on welfare and education.Very heavy use of welfare programs by Middle Eastern refugees, and the fact that they have only 10.5 years of education on average, makes it likely that it will be many years, if ever, before this population will cease to be a net fiscal drain on public coffers   using more in public services than they pay in taxes.It is worth adding that ORR often reports that most refugees are self-sufficient within five years. However, ORR defines  self-sufficiency  as not receiving cash welfare. A household is still considered  self-sufficient  even if it is using any number of non-cash programs such as food stamps, public housing, or Medicaid.Refugees are admitted for humanitarian reasons, not because they are supposed to be self-sufficient, so the drain on public coffers that Middle Eastern refugees create is expected. However, given limited resources, the high cost of resettlement in the United States means careful consideration should be given to alternatives to resettlement if the goal is the help as many people possible.

"Nov 13, 2017","One of the many targets of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS is accusing them of assisting the Kremlin in its effort to have him  imprisoned and killed. The strong allegation comes from Bill Browder, a London-based banker who spearheaded the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law vehemently opposed by the Russian government.Browder made the allegation in response to the recent revelation that Fusion GPS and its founder Glenn Simpson compiled what he says is false information about him that was given to Yuri Chaika, Russia s prosecutor general, and to Donald Trump Jr. during the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. If it is true that Glenn Simpson was supplying information about me to the Russian government, it s far more serious than smear campaigning or Foreign Agents Registration Act violations,  said Browder, the head of Hermitage Capital. It would mean that Simpson was assisting the Putin regime in their plot to get me back to Russia to have me imprisoned and killed.It was previously known that the Washington, D.C-based Fusion GPS s investigation of Browder was beneficial to the Russian government and its effort to reverse the Magnitsky Act. But it was revealed only last week that information Fusion collected on Browder was shared directly with Chaika, whose position is the Russian equivalent of the U.S. attorney general.Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney who attended the Trump Tower meeting, is who provided both Chaika and Trump Jr. with the Fusion-generated information on Browder. She took a four-page report into the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting, which was attended by Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Veselnitskaya worked with Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, on the anti-Browder project. Reuters reported on Thursday that Simpson compiled the research for the Trump Tower memo. And NBC News reported on Friday that similar research put together by Simpson was given by Veselnitskaya to Chaika in Oct. 2015.Browder, who was born in Chicago but is a British citizen, is a target of the Kremlin s ire because of his role in pushing through the Magnitsky Act, which passed Congress in 2012. The Russian government recently issued an Interpol arrest in an attempt to apprehend Browder. Vladimir Putin reportedly approved the move against the 53-year-old money manager, who wrote a book about his travails called  Red Notice,  a reference to the term used for Interpol warrants.Fusion GPS, which is based in Washington, D.C., became involved in the Browder matter after being hired by BakerHostetler, a law firm representing Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman who faced penalties because of the Magnitsky Act.Simpson worked closely on the investigation with the Moscow-based Veselnitskaya, who represents Katsyv and his firm, Prevezon Holdings.Veselnitskaya s affiliation with Simpson is one of the stranger story lines arising from both the Trump Tower meeting and the dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and DNC.Theories have circulated that Fusion GPS arranged the Trump Tower meeting in order to compromise the Trump campaign or that Simpson relayed details of the meeting provided by Veselnitskaya to Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier.Fusion was being paid for its dossier work at the same time it was being paid by BakerHostetler to investigate Browder.Adding even more fuel to those theories was a report this week that Simpson and Veselnitskaya met just before and just after she attended the Trump Tower session:BUSTED! MEETING BETWEEN FUSION GPS AND RUSSIAN LAWYER BEFORE AND AFTER:The co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the unverified Trump dossier, met with a Russian lawyer before and after a key meeting she had last year with Trump Jr. The contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to Russian interests, at a time when it was financing research to discredit then-candidate Donald Trump.The opposition research firm has faced renewed scrutiny after litigation revealed that the DNC and Hillary Clinton s campaign paid for that research. Congressional Republicans have since questioned whether that politically financed research contributed to the FBI s investigation of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign   making Fusion s 2016 contacts with Russian interests all the more relevant.DNC MONEY FUNNELED THROUGH LAW FIRM TO FUSION GPS?The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period. Bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying a former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump through his Russian contacts.But hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom. Court records show email correspondence and published reports corroborate the pair s presence together. They also were together after the Trump Tower meeting.Read more: Fox NewsRead more: Daily Caller",JUST IN: Anti-Putin Banker Claims Firm Tied To Clinton Campaign Assisted Russians In Effort ‘To Have Me Imprisoned And Killed’

They were discussing the tax plan and Hatch let Brown know he doesn t appreciate the class warfare propaganda THE MIDDLE CLASS WINS WITH TRUMP TAX PLAN:The Senate s plan to rewrite the tax code would go much further than a competing House proposal toward making good on Republican promises to focus on the middle class, a new report shows.Moderate-income people would consistently see the largest percentage declines in their tax bills, according to an analysis released late Saturday by the official, nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.In 2019, people in the middle of the income spectrum, earning between $50,000 and $70,000, would see their taxes fall by 7.1 percent. Those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 would see a 10.4 percent decline, the report shows, while millionaires would get a 5.3 percent tax cut.Unlike with the House plan, that trend holds up throughout the period over which JCT analyzed the Senate proposal. In 2027, for example, millionaires would get a 2.8 percent tax cut from the Senate plan, compared with a 6.1 percent decline for people in the middle and a 10.3 percent reduction for those earning between $20,000 and $30,000.How Republicans  tax plans would affect people in different income groups has been a hotly contested issue in Congress, with the GOP contending its plans are aimed at the middle class while Democrats call them a giveaway to the rich.The House proposal would have a muddled impact on people in different income groups, JCT found earlier this month. At first, modest-income people would be its biggest winners, but the outlook changes after the first few years. Some modest-income people would face tax increases under the House plan, JCT found, and by 2027, millionaires would be its biggest winners.The analysis of the Senate plan, which the Finance Committee plans to formally take up on Monday, shows people in every income cohort receiving a tax cut on average, though it did not examine whether some people within those groups would face tax increases.",YEA!

Hillary should be on bloody knees every day thanking her lucky stars she s not a Republican .Hillary Clinton gave a speech Thursday at the Council on Foreign Relation, where she outlined her genius plan to defeat ISIS. (Step 1: Defeat ISIS.) She also offered a few more specific proposals [emphasis added]:When it comes to terrorist financing, we have to go after the nodes that facilitate illicit trade and transactions. The U.N. Security Council should update its terrorism sanctions. They have a resolution that does try to block terrorist financing and other enabling activities, but we have to place more obligations on countries to police their own banks, and the United States, which has quite a record of success in this area, can share more intelligence to help other countries. And once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations as well as the schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path to radicalization.Clinton is right about the fact that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have for years funneled money to terrorist groups, essentially bribing them to ensure that they don t cause trouble in their incestual oligarchies. She is certainly right that these oil-rich countries have made a habit of giving away money to powerful interest groups in an effort to curry favor. Some of those groups happen to be comprised of terrorists, while others are charitable foundations founded by a former United States president whose wife is currently seeking the Democratic Party s nomination for the same position in 2016.Here s how much those three countries and their affiliated entities have donated to the Clinton Foundation:Qatar   Up to $5.8 million United Arab Emirates   Up to $11.5 million Saudi Arabia   Up to $50 millionThe gulf nations represent three of the largest donors to the foundation, but that is hardly the extent of their ties to the Clintons. Qatari, UAE, and Saudi firms paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars for speeches during the time Hillary served as secretary of state, when she also approved weapons deals with all three countries worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense firms, many of which are also Clinton Foundation donors.Bill Clinton has praised the Qataris as  intelligent, forward looking  investment partners for their collaboration on Clinton Foundation projects.

"Nov 2, 2015","Joe Wilson was right!Obviously, there are more than 5 lies Obama has told during his presidency, but who has enough time in the day to count them all? If past presidents are remembered for their signature achievements, Obama will be remembered for his signature lie:  If you like your health care plan, blah, blah, blah.  The reader knows the rest. Although the most consequential of Obama s lies   it got him re-elected   it s far from his only prevarication.I ve counted 75 significant lies since his campaign for president began, but that doesn t begin to tally the casual fibs and hyperbole he spouts seemingly every day. Here are five that illustrate just how much Obama s presidency is built on falsehoods.Obama made this claim in September 2009, when addressing the nation s schoolkids. By then, the blogosphere knew that baby Obama had never spent a night under the same roof as his father, let alone two years. For years, Obama and his advisers invested enormous political capital in what biographer David Remnick called Obama s  signature appeal: the use of the details of his own life as a reflection of a kind of multicultural ideal. Remnick called Obama s autobiography  a mixture of verifiable fact, recollection, recreation, invention and artful shaping.  In other words, the truth is never good enough.Obama spun this fiction at a September 2012 Univision forum knowing it was false. In fact, the bizarre, deadly idea to let American guns  walk  into Mexico, where they were used by drug cartels to kill dozens, began in October 2009. Three months earlier, White House press secretary Jay Carney had made the same bogus claim virtually word for word at a press conference and got shot down on national TV.  It began in fall 2009,  corrected White House correspondent Jake Tapper, then with ABC.Carney refused to acknowledge he lied, and the president continued to lie weeks later. It s all part of Obama s ducking of responsibility   it s always someone else s fault.Obama said this in response to Bill O Reilly s question about the IRS scandal:  You re saying no corruption?  If there were not even a  smidgen of corruption,  as Obama insisted, it is hard to understand what outraged him, or at least seemed to, when news of the IRS scandal first broke.  It s inexcusable, and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it,  Obama said in May 2013. Obama routinely expressed anger when some new scandal erupted on his watch   IRS, the failed ObamaCare website, the VA scandal, Fast and Furious   but never before had he shoved a scandal down the memory hole so quickly.And how could Obama know there wasn t a smidgen of corruption before the investigation was even over? Perhaps because the administration knew that any proof of that was gone with deleted emails and destroyed hard drives?During that same Super Bowl Sunday interview, Obama made this claim in response to O Reilly s inquiry about the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. Obama continued to dissemble:  The notion that we would hide the ball for political purposes when a week later we all said, in fact, there was a terrorist attack taking place and the day after I said it was an act of terror, that wouldn t be a very good coverup.  In fact, it was exactly a week after the attack, on Sept. 18, that Obama took his first questions about Benghazi. Bizarrely, he did so to David Letterman.  Here s what happened,  Obama said. You had a video that was released by somebody who lives here, sort of a shadowy character who   who made an extremely offensive video directed at   at Mohammed and Islam. We know now that the administration knew this wasn t true. Not a week later; not even the very night of the attacks.On many levels, this was Obama s most telling lie. He only deals with the world as he sees it, not as it is.Obama told this whopper to his assembled staff on his first day in office. He promised it to the press. Instead, his administration refuses to hand over documents and Obama refuses to answer questions. As liberal constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley assessed the presidency,  Barack Obama is really the president Richard Nixon always wanted to be.  What do these lies, just a sample of many, tell us? Obama never stopped  artfully shaping  his life.The scary thing is he might actually believe these lies. He believes that posting a shot from his personal photographer online is  transparent.  That targeting conservative groups for audits isn t corrupt. That everything that has gone wrong with his presidency is Bush s fault.Knowing that, how can we believe anything that he says?Jack Cashill is the author of  You Lie!

"Nov 20, 2015","So Sweden basically wants to ensure Muslims returning from raping and beheading innocent people overseas, that the government will help them find a job and receive psychological counseling.  The trauma they must be experiencing after committing Jihad against so many innocent people must be overwhelming   You just can t make these things up The Swedish capital of Stockholm has released its new policy document for dealing with ISIS fighters returning to the city after having had their fill of rape and beheadings of civilians. At first blush it seems strange that such a document would be all of 9 pages.I mean,  Shoot!  should only take up one page, even with a large font.Oh well, let s see how Stockholm intends to handle terrorist-trained and combat-hardened fanatics. Here are a few translated highlights to capture the gist of things: Post-perspective: When a person wishes to leave a violent extremist grouping or coming home from combat overseas, it is crucial to provide customized inclusion efforts. Even then, it is important to have a local cooperation between various actors. Voluntary organizations can provide targeted support and advice. Even faith communities working with advice, but also psychosocial support.When it comes to people who participated in combat there is likely to be great need of health efforts. Therefore, it is important to establish cooperation between social services, social psychiatry and drug units, as well as health centers and psychiatric services (trauma, PTSD, etc.)When it comes to security, it is important that cooperation between social services, income support, employment and other efforts by the Labour Department, as well as assistance with job placement.Finally, the accommodation issue is a prerequisite that must work. Therefore, cooperative housing companies needs to be included in the post-perspective. To summarize: The city of Stockholm will make it a priority to provide the returning ISIS fighters with housing, free health care (physical and mental) and full financial support, until they have received earmarked jobs. All this of course fast-tracked past the line of law-abiding immigrants and indigenous Swedes.Since they now provide all the recruitment incentives for joining ISIS, the only thing missing is a city-run recruitment office. Oh, wait. That would the Employment Office, where it was recently revealed that tax-paid clerks were recruiting for ISIS. Sorry, my mistake!Then it s time to make proactive efforts to discourage radicalization. The solution, the city concludes, is to pour tax money into muslim organizations already in contact with the at-risk persons: Support to associations and other stakeholders locally There are examples of local actors which can contribute to efforts locally. For example, the Islamic Association and the mosque in Rinkeby-Kista has initiated education for interested parents and youths in the J rva area. It is very important to support such local initiatives. It is also important to involve local associations, some of which have contact with residents that the authorities do not come into contact with. As journalist and blogger Per Gudmundson points out, the Islamic Association of Sweden is a remarkably poor choice for  fighting Jihad  since it is the Swedish branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. Their official motto reads: Allah is our goal, the prophet is our leader, the quran is our law, Jihad is our way, and death for the honor of Allah is our greatest desire! Gudmundson notes that they are in active combat in Syria at the moment, in coalition with Jabhat al-Nusrah which is a branch of al-Qaida.

"Nov 21, 2015","In normal times, Americans would demand these jihad compounds be shut down. But we re not living in  normal times.  Americans have been bullied into submission by the leftist shame police. We ve been told we re  racists  and  Islamophobes  for even suggesting Islamic terrorists have any ties to Islam. Our government tells us,  If you see something, say something.  But beware of the wrath of the Left if you  say something  against someone who happens to be part of the  protected victim class. If the fact that there are 23 jihad training camps within U.S. borders isn t frightening enough, the fact that president Barack Obama has done absolutely nothing about them should be.According to a document released by the Clarion Project, 23 confirmed terrorist Jihad compounds belonging to Jamaat ul-Fuqra, a Pakastan Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda-related organization, were operating within our own borders.The group of Muslims of America (MOA) are documented to have a connection to terrorism with training inside the United States. There was a 2002 unsolved murder at one of these compounds in Texas. When the Clarion Project obtained the 2007 FBI document detailing the Texas Enclave of MOA, what they found was deeply disturbing.The organization says it has a network of 22  villages  around the U.S., with Islamberg as its main headquarters in New York. TheClarion Project obtained secret MOA footage showing female members receiving paramilitary training at Islamberg. It was featured on the Kelly File on FOX News Channel in October. A second MOA tape released by Clarion shows its spokesman declaring the U.S. to be a Muslim-majority country.A 2007 FBI record states that MOA members have been involved in at least 10 murders, one disappearance, three firebombings, one attempted firebombing, two explosive bombings and one attempted bombing.It states: The MOA is now an autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S. The documented propensity for violence by this organization supports the belief the leadership of the MOA extols membership to pursue a policy of jihad or holy war against individuals or groups it considers enemies of Islam, which includes the U.S. Government. Members of the MOA are encouraged to travel to Pakistan to receive religious and military/terrorist training from Sheikh Gilani. The document also says that,  The MOA is now an autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S.  ~Clarion ProjectJamaat ul-Fuqra is known to be an extremely militant group of international terrorists. The compounds allaegedly provide paramilitary training to new recruits for jihad against America.The document also claimed that Jamaat ul-Fuqra was an  autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S. This document was obtained in 2007, but still nothing has been done about these compounds or their activities.If you re wondering why, the answer lies with our very own president and Department of Homeland Security, which refuse to classify Jamaat ul-Fuqra as a foreign terrorist organization   even though plenty of evidence proving they are terrorists reportedly exists.The fact that Obama has done nothing to stop these groups only reinforces the notion that he chooses to support Muslim interests over American interests, and that is disturbing in every way.What kind of president allows this kind of training to happen in his own backyard?This is as good a reason as any for Americans to exercise their Second Amendment rights. If our president is more worried about being politically correct than he is the safety of our country, then the people deserve the right to defend themselves.Via: Conservative Tribune ",Why Would Obama Regime Allow 23 Jihad Training Camps “Capable Of Mounting Terror Campaigns Within U.S.” To Remain Open?

Trump got annoyed,  the source told Yahoo News.The election night photo incident was one of several factors Trump insiders cited to explain why Christie was demoted from his position as transition team chair and replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Nov. 11.In addition to the three Trump campaign sources who spoke to Yahoo News, two junior staffers also described specific instances of alleged mismanagement by Christie that got the transition off to a slow start. The two staffers said Christie did alarmingly little work on the transition and was largely absent from the campaign during the weeks leading up to the election, when Trump was widely expected to lose. According to one account, campaign staffers had been so accustomed to Christie s absence that they were surprised to see him appear at campaign headquarters in Trump Tower   on Election Day.

"Nov 22, 2015","If the Republican Party really cared about winning this race, they d cancel the upcoming debate with CNN. The only logical reason for the GOP establishment to agree to allow CNN to host the next debate would be if they were working behind the scenes with CNN to take Trump out. But the RNC wouldn t do that would they? Left-wing cable news network CNN has been caught red-handed selectively editing Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump s comments about a  Muslim registry,  and doing so in order to make it sound as though he is agreeing to this registry. He is not.The edited video is yet another lying log on the left-wing garbage fire that is CNN, and yet in just three weeks, this very same garbage fire is hosting the next Republican presidential debate!What exactly does CNN have to do in order to lose its right to depose these candidates for two hours in front of the whole world? If CNN is already maliciously editing video to  take out  out the frontrunner, I don t even want to speculate.Courtesy of Gateway Pundit, watch the CNN video. Pay special attention to the sneaky edit just before Trump says  absolutely :The left-wing liars at CNN have intentionally edited the video to make it look as though Trump said  absolutely  to a Muslim registry. What CNN edited out is in bold:Reporter: Should there be a database system that tracks Muslims who are in this country?Trump: There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems, and today you can do it. But right now we need to have a border, we have to have strength, we have to have a wall, and we cannot let what s happening to this country happen any longer.Reporter: Is that something your White House would like to implement?Donald Trump: I would certainly implement that. Absolutely.Trump s  absolutely  is clearly in reference to strengthening the border. Look at the whole transcript. When the NBC News reporter asks,  Is that something your White House would like to implement?,  Trump has just talked about fortifying the border and obviously believes that is what the NBC reporter is referring to.CNN edited that out!It is time for Reince Priebus and the Republican Party to stand up these left-wing hit squads disguising themselves as journalists.CNN should not be allowed within a country mile of a GOP debate.How many more warning signs does the Republican Party need to realize that this is a suicide mission?Do we want to win in 2016, or not?Via: Breitbart News",SNIVELING COWARDS AT CNN Caught Editing Trump Tape With “Muslim” Comments [VIDEO]

"Nov 23, 2015","Congresswoman Gabbard also criticizes Hillary s strategy. Is it possible we re hearing a Democrat who s actually making sense? Hmmm .this is gonna leave a mark Last month, US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard went on CNN and laid bare Washington s Syria strategy.In a remarkably candid interview with Wolf Blitzer, Gabbard calls Washington s effort to oust Assad  counterproductive  and  illegal  before taking it a step further and accusing the CIA of arming the very same terrorists who The White House insists are  sworn enemies. In short, Gabbard all but tells the American public that the government is lying to them and may end up inadvertently starting  World War III. For those who missed it, here s the clip:https://youtu.be/IHkher6ceaAThat was before Paris.Well, in the wake of the attacks, Gabbard has apparently had just about enough of Washington vacillating in the fight against terror just so the US can ensure that ISIS continues to destabilize Assad and now, with bi-partisan support, the brazen Hawaii Democrat has introduced legislation to end the  illegal war  to overthrow Assad.Gabbard, who fought in Iraq   twice   has partnered with Republican Adam Scott on the bill. Here s AP:In an unusual alliance, a House Democrat and Republican have teamed up to urge the Obama administration to stop trying to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad and focus all its efforts on destroying Islamic State militants.Reps. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat, and Austin Scott, a Republican, introduced legislation on Friday to end what they called an  illegal war  to overthrow Assad, the leader of Syria accused of killing tens of thousands of Syrian citizens in a more than four-year-old civil war entangled in a battle against IS extremists, also known as ISIS. The U.S. is waging two wars in Syria,  Gabbard said.  The first is the war against ISIS and other Islamic extremists, which Congress authorized after the terrorist attack on 9/11. The second war is the illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad. Scott said,  Working to remove Assad at this stage is counter-productive to what I believe our primary mission should be. Since 2013, the CIA has trained an estimated 10,000 fighters, although the number still fighting with so-called moderate forces is unclear. CIA-backed rebels in Syria, who had begun to put serious pressure on Assad s forces, are now under Russian bombardment with little prospect of rescue by their American patrons, U.S. officials say.For years, the CIA effort had foundered   so much so that over the summer, some in Congress proposed cutting its budget. Some CIA-supported rebels had been captured; others had defected to extremist groups.Gabbard complained that Congress has never authorized the CIA effort, though covert programs do not require congressional approval, and the program has been briefed to the intelligence committees as required by law, according to congressional aides who are not authorized to be quoted discussing the matter.Gabbard contends the effort to overthrow Assad is counter-productive because it is helping IS topple the Syrian leader and take control of all of Syria. If IS were able to seize the Syrian military s weaponry, infrastructure and hardware, the group would become even more dangerous than it is now and exacerbate the refugee crisis. And make no mistake, Tulsi s understanding of Washington s absurd Mid-East policy goes far beyond Syria. That is, Gabbard fully grasps the big picture as well. Here s what she has to say about the idea that the US should everywhere and always attempt to overthrow regimes when human rights groups claim there s evidence of oppression: People said the very same thing about Saddam (Hussein), the very same thing about (Moammar) Gadhafi, the results of those two failed efforts of regime change and the following nation-building have been absolute, not only have they been failures, but they ve actually worked to strengthen our enemy.  Somebody get Langley on the phone, this woman must be stopped.Here s Gabbard speaking to CNN this week about Assad: So there s hope for the US public after all.Perhaps if the clueless masses won t listen to  lunatic  fringe blogs or Sergei Lavrov, they ll listen to a US Congresswoman who served two tours of duty in Iraq and who is now telling Americans that The White House, The Pentagon, and most especially the CIA are together engaged in an  illegal  effort to overthrow the government of a sovereign country and in the process are arming the very same extremists that are attacking civilians in places like Paris.Good luck Tulsi, and thanks for proving that there s at least one person inside that Beltway that isn t either dishonest or naive.Via: Zero HedgeFrom Gabbard Here are 10 reasons the U.S. must end its war to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad:Because if we succeed in overthrowing the Syrian government of Assad, it will open the door for ISIS, al-Qaeda, and other Islamic extremists to take over all of Syria. There will be genocide and suffering on a scale beyond our imagination. These Islamic extremists will take over all the weaponry, infrastructure, and military hardware of the Syrian army and be more dangerous than ever before. We should not be allying ourselves with these Islamic extremists by helping them achieve their goal because it is against the security interests of the United States and all of civilization. Because the money and weapons the CIA is providing to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad are going directly or indirectly into the hands of the Islamic extremist groups, including al-Qaeda affiliates, al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, and others who are the actual enemies of the United States. These groups make up close to 90 percent of the so-called opposition forces, and are the most dominant fighters on the ground. Because our efforts to overthrow Assad has increased and will continue to increase the strength of ISIS and other Islamic extremists, thus making them a bigger regional and global threat. Because this war has exacerbated the chaos and carnage in Syria and, along with the terror inflicted by ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups fighting to take over Syria, continues to increase the number of Syrians forced to flee their country. Because we should learn from our past mistakes in Iraq and Libya that U.S. wars to overthrow secular dictators (Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi) cause even more chaos and human suffering and open the door for Islamic extremists to take over in those countries. Because the U.S. has no credible government or government leader ready to bring order, security, and freedom to the people of Syria. Because even the  best case  scenario that the U.S. successfully overthrows the Syrian government of Assad would obligate the United States to spend trillions of dollars and the lives of American service members in the futile effort to create a new Syria. This is what we have been trying to do in Iraq for twelve years, and we still have not succeeded. The situation in Syria will be much more difficult than in Iraq. Because our war against the Syrian government of Assad is interfering with our being one-pointedly focused on the war to defeat ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and the other Islamic extremists who are our actual enemy. Because our war to overthrow the Assad government puts us in direct conflict with Russia and increases the likelihood of war between the United States and Russia and the possibility of another world war.

The phony outrage that Obama showed the world over this little fake  clock boy s  arrest should sicken every American. It is especially disturbing when one considers Obama s deafening silence over the horrific gang violence that plagues his hometown of Chicago. Where were the tweets of outrage from the White House over the loss of this beautiful young boy s life? Crickets On Friday, prosecutors laid out their case against a man accused of murdering 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee on Nov. 2Corey Morgan, 27, of suburban Lansing, was charged in the murder. Police have one other man in custody who has not yet been charged, and a third man, Kevin Edwards, is also wanted in the slaying.Prosecutors say Corey Morgan (left) and Kevin Edwards planned the heinous murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee.Assistant State s Attorney George Canellis said Friday the shooting stemmed from an ongoing feud between Morgan s gang, the BBG (Bang Bang Gang)/Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones and the Killaward faction of the Gangster Disciples.The feud came to a boil after an Oct. 13 shooting in which Morgan s brother, Tracey Morgan was killed and his mother was wounded. Morgan was so enraged he threatened to shoot  grandmas, mamas, kids and all  in retaliation, prosecutors said.Tyshawn was hit in his back, forearm and head, and part of his thumb was shot off as if he was raising his hand to block the shots, Canellis said. This murder was committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner,  Canellis said.Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy vowed to destroy the group responsible for the boy s brutal murder. They are going to be obliterated,  he said.  That gang just signed its death warrant. McCarthy did not detail each suspect s role in the shooting. We know that there were three individuals involved in this,  he said.Morgan s arrest comes nearly a month after Tyshawn s Nov. 2 shooting death.Police are hunting for Kevin Edwards, also suspected in the shooting.Court documents paint a disturbing picture of the planned attack, explaining that Morgan and his accomplices allegedly saw Tyshawn playing on the swings in a playlot with his basketball beside him. One of the suspects allegedly started dribbling Tyshawn s ball, ultimately luring him into the alley where police say he was  executed.

The guide encourages the use of the more inclusive substitutes  U.S. citizen  or  Resident of the U.S.  The guide also tries to get students to stop saying  Caucasian,   illegal Immigrant,   mother,   father  and even the word  healthy  is said to shame those who aren t healthy. 9)  Late yesterday afternoon, ACLJ filed a lawsuit on behalf of Brandon Jenkins against officials of The Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) in Maryland for denying Brandon admission to its Radiation Therapy Program in part due to his expression of religious beliefs.

"Nov 3, 2016","The National Archives inspector general investigated the theft. Later emails released by the State Department do not indicate if the federal government ever found the hard drive.There s also the separate case of Sandy Berger who literally stuck documents in his clothes and left the National Archives with them. He was later found cutting the documents up with scissors! It s understood that he wanted to destroy any papers with writing/notes written in the margins. He was the National Security advisor for the Clinton administration and it appears he was a good and loyal soldier to the Clintons when he destroyed evidence These two case of stolen documents have not been solved and we feel it s yet another case of a Clinton coverup A newly released email from the State Department shows that Hillary Clinton was informed in April 2009 of a massive theft of data pertaining to former President Bill Clinton s White House records.On April 13, 2009, Clinton attorney Cheryl Mills informed newly sworn-in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton via email that the National Archives could not account for a two-terabyte hard drive. The drive may contain a wide range of memos, emails, and other electronic documents from the Clinton White House.  The hard drive contained information from the administration of her husband, former President Bill Clinton.The email was made public from State Department files on Thursday as part of an ongoing release of recovered emails that had been previously deleted from Clinton s private server.The forwarded email said the National Archives had a duplicate and was examining it to know what was stolen. It was stolen or misplaced between Jan. 30, 2009, and March 24, 2009.The possible data losses were all serious but only three documents were classified. Social Security numbers and dates of births may have been lost to thieves. Political information may have been stolen too. Two terabytes is a very very large amount of data; the drive may contain a wide range of memos, emails, and other electronic documents from the Clinton White House,  wrote Blake Roberts, deputy associate White House counsel for President Barack Obama.  All the material is unclassified, except for three documents which Bill Leary has examined and does not believe present any significant risk. But the loss was still serious. Based on its analysis, NARA (National Archives) believes the drive contains other sensitive material, including: There is at least a 50% likelihood that the personal information (including DOB and SSN) of all individuals placed through the Clinton Presidential Personnel Office was on the lost hard drive,  wrote Roberts.  There is a 90% likelihood that the personal information (including DOB and SSN) of all Clinton WH staff was on the lost hard drive. There is a 100% chance that some of it was on the lost hard drive. The three classified documents were authored by Lael Brainard, then a top nominee for the Department of the Treasury, Roberts wrote. There are almost certainly records from many other White House officials,  he said.The National Archives inspector general investigated the theft. Later emails released by the State Department do not indicate if the federal government ever found the hard drive. The federal government said they would notify affected people of the breach.The National Archives later did issue a press release on July 16, 2009, updating the public on the search for the hard drive. It offered a reward of $50,000. It also said 15,750 individuals had to be notified by mail of the possible theft.It s not clear why the hard drive was stolen eight years after Bill Clinton left office, and at the start of a new Democratic administration that included his wife, Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state.Theft of records from the National Archives had happened before.The late Sandy Berger, Bill Clinton s national security adviser from 1997 to 2001, removed several documents from the National Archives between Sept. 2, 2003, and Oct. 2, 2003.Berger removed the classified documents from the National Archives by sneaking them out in his socks and pants. Berger then stored and retained such documents at his place of employment.

Agents felt up Mrs. Manafort lying in bed to see if she had guns,  the source said of the intimidation.In all, 12 FBI agents entered the home, guns drawn, and stayed for hours.The aggressive search of a prone sleepy woman is, the source said, a hallmark of Mr. Mueller s top prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann. A former mob prosecutor in New York, he specializes in turning witnesses against bigger prey and is not afraid to make things rough for spouses, too.

"Nov 30, 2015","So the irony isn t lost on me when I saw the still shot of Hillary wearing the Muslim symbol of submission to men in her new ad. This woman wants to be seen as strong and knowledgeable on foreign policy but obviously doesn t understand the message she s sending out. Does Hillary Clinton not know what wearing a hijab means or is she just that stupid to throw one on for votes? It s like when she puts on the phony Southern accent when she s in South Carolina. Pandering to the Muslims and those that think it s just so great that she s so diverse tells us all we need to know about this hag. She d do anything to get elected even wear a symbol of oppression how ironic! Daniel Greenfield gives us the lowdown on the symbolism of wearing a hijab:Hillary s latest campaign video tries to build up her non-existent foreign policy experience. That means making as much as possible out of her feminist speech in China  which avoided criticizing a Communist regime that forces women to have abortions. (Or as her Planned Parenthood pals call it, health care outreach.) And showing her travel photo slideshow.It s basically like those travel videos friends force you to watch  except this is a really expensive commercial and no one can force you to watch it.But in odd contrast to touting Hillary s feminism and strength, is this shot of her wearing a Hijab; an Islamic garment of submission.Not only has the Hijab consistently been a source of Muslim violence against women, both in punishing women who don t wear it and punishing women who take it off, but its origins lie in an Islamic commandment distinguishing Muslim women, who couldn t be raped, from non-Muslim slave women captured by Mohammed s rampaging gang.It s really quite explicit.The Koranic verse that mandates covering states,  O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks all over their bodies that they may thus be distinguished and not molested  (Koran 33:59)That s not modesty. The covering is being worn to avoid rape.The key words here are  distinguished and not molested . Whom are these women being distinguished from? Women who don t cover up and can be molested.Hillary s  cloak  is incomplete by Saudi or Taliban standards, but all these coverings are meant to be a symbolic form of Purdah, the physical confinement of a woman, even within her home.In her commercial, Hillary Clinton, by wearing the Hijab, is advertising that she is the property of a man and therefore  not to be molested . Of course since Islamic law doesn t recognize the marriages of non-Muslim peoples it is at war with, enabling Jihadis to sexually assault even married non-Muslim women, as the Islamic prophet Mohammed allowed his Muslim followers to do, it s also a meaningless gesture.Is it really a feminist gesture to voluntarily accept the Islamic distinction between women who can be assaulted and women who can t?Either way it s certainly a step back for a female politician who wants to be seen as a leader and a fighter for women.Via: Front Page Magazine",Hillary’s Latest Ad Pushes Muslim Agenda Of Submission To Men

He even offers to arrange a friendly interview for Hillary with Megyn. Here is the text from the email:Dear Jen,I know what I m about to propose is very risky and will be instinctively viewed negatively on the first reaction. But because of the high advantages that I see, perfectly aware of the risks, I think this proposal should be considered.I propose that the Secretary be on the Megyn Kelly File show for at least 30 minutes. I believe I can reduce the risks, since I know Megyn and Roger Ailes very well, by ensuring that the Secretary will have an opportunity to answer tough questions on emails and other issues without interruption. In fact, I believe it is in the interest of Secretary Clinton as well as Fox for the questions to be tough, something we should not fear as long as she has an opportunity to answer. I know she will do well with adequate preparation, and especially after yesterday s excellent statement taking full responsibility for mixing personal an official business on a single email device.I still believe the issue of the wiping out of the private server still needs to be dealt with   e.g., simply stating that was done primarily to protect personal privacy on personal emails but she made the mistake of mixing personal with official on the server because she was using a single device, and she should have been more transparent shortly after she left office. This interview has the potential to be a ratings and media bonanza. I have confidence she would hit a political home run and have a massive audience to deliver her message without a filter. Of course there is a risk that Megan will try to show how tough she can be, even tougher than on Trump. I am assuming the worst case on that risk. But if we have a guarantee, which I believe We will get, that she will have an uninterrupted chance to respond to every question, and we have time to prepare, I think this could be a major plus and even a game changer in the various negative narratives about the Secretary being largely inaccessible and sometimes testy with the media.Here is a screen shot of the original email:",WIKILEAKS EMAIL: CLINTON FAN BOY Says He “Knows” Trump-Hater Megyn Kelly…Offers To Arrange Softball Interview For Hillary
"Nov 4, 2017","The Obama administration s well guarded Osama bin Laden documents were released on Wednesday by CIA director Mike Pompeo. The documents were seized in a raid after U.S. SEAL Rob O Neill killed Osama bin Laden. The Obama administration basically politicized the intelligence agencies when they hand-picked just a few of the 470,000 documents to release. They hid damning evidence that could have hurt Obama s chance at reelection in 2012 .OBAMA RAN THE CLOCK OUT AL QAEDA WAS NOT  ON THE RUN :Steve Hayes of the Weekly Standard:  In a manner of speaking, Barack Obama wanted what al Qaeda already had: a mutually beneficial partnership with Tehran. Revealing to the American people the truth about Osama bin Laden s cozy working relationship with the Iranian government might have fatally undermined that diplomatic quest, just as the ongoing vitality of al Qaeda, amply testified to in the bin Laden documents, would have contradicted Obama s proud claims in 2012 that al Qaeda was  on the run.  So Obama, with the eager cooperation of some in the intelligence community, bottled up the bin Laden documents and ran out the clock.IRAN S CLOSE TIES TO AL QAEDA COULD HURT THE IRAN DEAL:Within the documents is an assessment by a senior jihadist with al Qaeda   Tehran ties: how Iran supplied  everything needed,  including  money, arms  and  training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon,  including safe haven for other jihadis, the New York Post reported.The assessment is raising questions as to how much then-President Obama knew about Iran s ties to al Qaeda before making his controversial deal. And it points to the reason why the former administration might have kept the documents under lock and key.The Obama White House had this information for five years before making the nuclear deal that critics argued would ultimately make it easier for the terror state to build nuclear weapons. Bin Laden had called Iran a  main artery for funds, personnel and communication  for al Qaeda, the Post reported.That wasn t the only suspicious dealing Obama had with Iran. In August 2016, Republicans were furious over a reported deal Obama had made to release American hostages in Iran.The former administration denied paying $400 million in  ransom  for the hostages, arguing that it was part of a legal settlement in a long-standing case. However, it was only the first of three payments to the Iranians totaling $1.3 billion that took place after the hostage release, as the Wall Street Journal disclosed. And strikingly, much of the case came by way of plane-loads of cash in international currencies.But the revelations about bin Laden and the former administration don t end there.MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO BIN LADEN:In one of the 10,000 videos files contained within the newly released documents, bin Laden is asked to name is his influences. The terrorist leader didn t hesitate, The National reported. From a religious aspect, I was committed within the Muslim Brotherhood. Bin Laden also suggested the Muslim Brotherhood sponsored his first trip as a young jihadi. It was the first time I travelled to a country where I did not know the language,  he writes.  I carried a pistol and went. The Brotherhood, they had poor knowledge about things. If they knew, I would not have had to travel through Syria to Antakya 12 hours by bus to reach Istanbul. It was easier from Jeddah to Istanbul by plane. Three hours by plane. MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO CLINTONS:Critics of the Muslim Brotherhood have long warned of its terror affiliation and infiltration into the West.

Friday on ABC s  The View,  Republican presidential candidate and former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Carly Fiorina fought toe to toe with the co-hosts over their comments disparaging her face as demented  and a  Halloween Mask. After small talk, Whoopi Goldberg brought up the subject saying,  How about humor? I m going the bring it up because there are going to be lots of comics saying lots of things. I wondered, because we saw some of the that you were a little upset with us about a comic comment that was made. And so, how will you steel your skin? How will you get a thicker skin to accept some of the humorous things that will be said about you? Fiorina said,  Well, hey, if you meant your comment about my face being demented and a Halloween mask as humorous, so be it. I guess you misinterpreted Donald Trump s questions. I have a real thick skin. Joy Behar said,  I defended you against Donald Trump s comment. He s running for president of the United States and he was making a nasty comment about your looks. I took him on. On this show, but, we are comedians here. I make fun of Hillary s pantsuits. Hillary s husband s sex life. Rep. John Boehner s tan. Who else? I don t understand why any politician is exempt from my jokes. Here s the clip from Carly s awesome interview:Fiorina answered,  You know what, Joy. You know what, Joy? You can say whatever you want. You always have. You always will. I m not going to stop that. And don t worry, I have skin plenty thick enough to the take whatever people throw at me. I m making a different point. The different point is this. I think that there are real issues in this nation that we ought to be able to discuss in a fact-based, civil fashion. Michelle Collins said,  I want to add that the demented comment was a poor choice of words. It was responding to something you said during the debates. That people were telling you the smile more. To me, it felt like it was not your natural state of mind. It was not on your looks, it was on your expression. It felt like you were being told to smile more. I m wondering, is that difficult for you? Do you have people coaching you to act or be a different way? Will that help you win the election? Fiorina shot back,  First of all, I don t have people coaching me to act a different way or be a different way. There s a time to smile and a time to be serious. When you re talking about burying a child, it s not time to smile. There are serous issues facing the nation. Goldberg said,  We had you here. I thought we were pretty respectful. I have to tell you, having watched some of the press that you have garnered based on this fake feud with  The View,  I m a little taken aback. Because you kind of said that that somehow liberal women are that we re made uncomfortable by conservative women. We were not uncomfortable with you. Did you think we were uncomfortable with you when you were on? Fiorina said,  First of all, Whoopi. I enjoyed being on the show. The first time. and I m enjoying being on the show the second time. And I think  The View  garnered a lot of publicity over the feud as well. I think that s why we re on. Goldberg said,   We haven t put out any ads or anything.

"Nov 7, 2016","The election is Tuesday. So it s time to make my final case for Donald J. Trump. My case is pretty simple   it s Trump or it s the end of America.I was raised as a middle-class kid in the greatest country in world history. A country built around mobility, opportunity and economic freedom. A country that allowed this son of a butcher to become a successful business owner, media personality, best-selling author and TV star and producer. Only in America.I was taught by my wonderful, patriotic, true red, white and blue, salt-of-the-earth, American parents that certain specific things made America great. Here they are:Faith in God, prayer, love of country, family, a belief in American exceptionalism, capitalism, Judeo-Christian values, the Constitution, limited government, personal responsibility, economic freedom, the military and police. Well don t look now. But everything from that list above   everything we believe in   everything that made America great   has been under full-scale assault for eight long years   from multiple directions. And Hillary is here to finish the job. She already publicly stated she wants to be Obama s third term.The truth is we either send a strong message heard around the world and elect Trump, or the America we know and love is gone. Forever.Because if Trump doesn t win, no other Republican will ever be elected president again. President Hillary Clinton will make sure of that. Hillary will open the borders like never before to let in millions of illegal aliens who have no love for anything that made America great.Foreigners come here not out of a love for America, but for a love of the cradle-to-grave welfare state that America has become. Eighty percent of them (or higher) will vote Democrat forever more to keep the welfare checks coming. That s Hillary s plan.Don t believe me? See California. No Republican will ever again be elected to statewide office. This was the exact formula that destroyed California. Open the borders, let in millions of foreigners, make them dependent on government welfare checks and then train them to vote Democrat to keep the handouts coming.It worked!That was the experiment. Now Democrats are onto Plan B   to turn the rest of America into California.Hillary will open the borders and tie the hands of border agents in order to flood the country with millions of new illegals. Hillary will legalize the 12 million to 15 million or so already here   and give them the right to vote.Hillary will also enthusiastically import millions of Muslim refugees who have no love for America, capitalism, the Constitution, or certainly Judeo-Christian values. Some will become terrorists, almost all will require cradle-to-grave welfare. Then it s over for America.So vote. Drag your friends to the polls. Make phone calls to your entire address book. Leave no stone unturned.Think of the U.S. Supreme Court.Think of open borders.Think of your children s and grandchildren s future.Then vote for Trump like it s   Trump, or the end of America.Because it is.Wayne Allyn Root is a best-selling author and host of  WAR Now: The Wayne Allyn Root Show  3 p.m. to 6 p.m. daily at 790 Talk Now.

"November 1, 2017 "," (This November 1 story has been corrected to read 25,000 in paragraph 11) By Karolina Tagaris  and Deborah Kyvrikosaios ATHENS (Reuters) - A group of mainly Syrian women and children who have been stranded in Greece pitched tents opposite parliament in Athens on Wednesday in a protest against delays in reuniting with relatives in Germany. Some of the refugees, who say they have been in Greece for over a year, said they had begun a hunger strike.  Our family ties our stronger than your illegal agreements,  read a banner held up by one woman, referring to deals on refugees between European Union nations. Greek media have reported that Greece and Germany informally agreed in May to slow down refugee reunification, stranding families in Greece for months after they fled Syria s civil war. Greece denies this.  What we ve managed to do on family reunification is to have an increase of about 27 percent this year compared with last year, even though we re accused of cutting back family reunification and doing deals to cut back family reunification,  Migration Minister Yannis Mouzalas told reporters. Mouzalas said Greece had assurances from Germany that refugees whose applications have been accepted will eventually go to Germany even if there are delays. He denied that refugees had to pay for their flights.  Applications for asylum, reunification and relocation to other European countries can take months to be processed.  I have not seen my husband, my child, for more than one year and nine months,  said 32-year-old Syrian Dalal Rashou, who has five children, one of whom is in Germany with her husband.  I miss him and every day I am here in Greece I cry. I don t want to stay here, I want to go to my husband  she said. About 60,000 refugees and migrants, mostly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis, have become stranded in Greece after border closures in the Balkans halted the onward journey many planned to take to central and western Europe. Some 25,000 refugees and migrants have crossed to Greece from Turkey this year - a fraction of the nearly 1 million arrivals in 2015 - but arrivals have picked up in recent months. An average of 214 people arrived each day in September, up from 156 in August, 87 in July and 56 in March, Mouzalas said. The rise has stretched Greek island camps, which are struggling to cope with numbers two to three times their capacity. Most new arrivals are women and children, according to United Nations data. Mouzalas said the government was in talks with local authorities to move refugees and migrants to local accommodation, including hotels, and it also planned to increase the capacity of some facilities.

"November 12, 2017 ","MANILA (Reuters) - Leaders from across Asia joined U.S. President Donald Trump at an extravagant gala dinner in the Philippines  capital on Sunday, a show of amity in a region fraught with tensions that have lurked behind his marathon tour of the continent. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte set the tone of cordiality ahead of the two days of summit meetings he will host, suggesting that despite their differences over claims to the South China Sea, the leaders should not discuss the issue.  We have to be friends, the other hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues,  Duterte said at a business conference, as planes carrying heads of state and government attending the summit landed in quick succession in Manila.   The South China Sea is better left untouched, nobody can afford to go to war. It can ill-afford a violent confrontation.  Hours earlier, during a bilateral visit to Vietnam, Trump offered to mediate in the dispute over the South China Sea, where four Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan contest China s sweeping claims to the busy waterway. All the claimants will be at the summit, except for Taiwan. Trump will join leaders of Southeast and East Asian nations in Manila over the next two days, the last leg of a tour that has taken him to Japan, South Korea and China as well as Vietnam. The sheer length of the trip - the longest to Asia by a U.S. president in more than a quarter century - may reassure some that, despite Trump s  America First  policy, Washington remains committed to a region China sees as its strategic domain. Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand arrived one by one for a glitzy gala dinner where they were entertained by singers and dancers. Each of the men sported a cream-colored barong, a traditional Philippines shirt made of fiber from the pineapple plant, embroidered and worn untucked. They were served a four-course Filipino-Asian fusion meal curate and prepared by Chef Jessie Sincioco, who also designed the menu for Pope Francis when he visited the Philippines in 2015. Police used water canon to prevent hundreds of protesters reaching the U.S. embassy in Manila ahead of Trump s arrival. Carrying placards declaring  Dump Trump  and  Down with U.S. Imperialism , the left-wing protesters were blocked by police in riot gear with shields and batons, and then showered with jets of water from a fire engine. The United States and its former colony, the Philippines,  have been strategic allies since World War Two.  Trump is expected to try during the summit to shore up relations, which have been strained by the mercurial Duterte s notorious anti-U.S. sentiment and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. Duterte - sometimes described as the  Trump of the East  because of his brash style - said last week he would tell the U.S. president to  lay off  if he raised the issue of human rights when they met. More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police call self-defense in a war on drugs declared by Duterte. Critics say executions are taking place with no accountability, allegations the police reject. But Trump, who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad, praised Duterte in May for doing an  unbelievable job on the drug problem .  INDO-PACIFIC  Trump s tour comes against a background of tensions on the Korean peninsula following exchanges of war-like threats and insults between North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un and Trump over Pyongyang s nuclear and missile development program. China has been urged by both South Korea and the United States to take a more active role in curbing North Korea s nuclear and missile ambitions. During his tour, Trump and his team have repeatedly used the term  Indo-Pacific  instead of  Asia-Pacific  for the region, which some see as an effort to depict it as more than China-dominated. Pacific Rim nation leaders agreed in Vietnam on Saturday to address  unfair trade practices  and  market distorting subsidies , a statement that bore the imprint of Trump s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. The summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Vietnam put on show the contrasting vision of the  America First  policy with the traditional consensus favoring multinational deals that China now seeks to champion. Manila hosted the APEC summit two years ago, and at that meeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a Twitter poll with the hashtag #APEChottie that asked people to vote for the most attractive leader there. Journalists swarmed the youthful leader and screamed in excitement. On his latest visit, Trudeau visited an outlet of Jollibee, a chain that has become a byword for Filipino fast food, chatting and posing for selfies, charming the people of Manila again.

"November 13, 2017 ","ANKARA (Reuters) - Exhausted and exposed to freezing cold, survivors of a weekend earthquake in western Iran begged authorities for food and shelter on Tuesday, saying aid was slow to reach them. Iranian officials called off rescue operations earlier in  the day on the grounds that there was little chance of finding more survivors from the quake, which killed at least 530 people and injured thousands of others. It was Iran s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade.  Survivors, many left homeless by Sunday s 7.3 magnitude quake that struck villages and towns in Kermansheh province along the mountainous border with Iraq, struggled through another bleak day on Tuesday in need of food, water and shelter. Iran has so far declined offers of foreign assistance to deal with the aftermath of the tremor, which officials said damaged 30,000 homes and completely destroyed two villages.  The U.S. government expressed condolences to the Iranian people despite President Donald Trump s  aggressive  policy towards the Islamic Republic, Iranian state media reported.   We are hungry. We are cold. We are homeless. We are alone in this world,  a weeping Maryam Ahang, who lost 10 members of her family in the hardest hit town of Sarpol-e Zahab, told Reuters by telephone.  My home is now a pile of mud and broken tiles. I slept in the park last night. It is cold and I am scared.   Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged state agencies on Tuesday to speed up aid efforts. President Hassan Rouhani paid a visit to the stricken region, promising to resolve  the problems in the shortest time .  Thousands of people huddled in makeshift camps while many others chose to spend another cold night in the open because they feared more tremors after some 230 aftershocks.    In some areas, no building was left standing and those that were had been deserted for fear they could come crashing down at any moment. Houses in impoverished Iranian villages are often made of concrete blocks or mudbrick that can quickly crumble and collapse in a strong quake.  State television aired footage of weeping villagers carrying away bodies wrapped in bloodied blankets and bed sheets and scrabbling with their bare hands through rubble in search of friends and relatives.  It was my cousin s birthday ... All the relatives were there ... like 50 people. But now almost all are dead,  Reza, who refused to give his full name, told Reuters from Sarpol-e Zahab town. He lost 34 members of his family on Sunday.    We spent two nights in the cold. Where is the aid?   On the Iraq side of the frontier, nine people were killed and over 550 injured, all in the northern Kurdish provinces. Television showed rescue workers combing through the rubble of dozens of villages immediately after the quake. But by Tuesday morning Iranian officials said there was no longer any likelihood of finding survivors and called off the search.  Hospitals in nearby provinces took in many of the injured, state television said, airing footage of survivors waiting to be treated. Hundreds of critically injured were dispatched to hospitals in Tehran.   Iran s Red Crescent said emergency shelter had been provided for thousands of homeless people but a lack of electricity and water, as well as blocked roads, hindered aid supply efforts.  People in some villages are still in dire need of food, water and shelter,  said Faramraz Akbari, governor of Qasr-e Shirin county in Kermanshah province.  State TV showed dozens of green and white tents dotting Sarpol-e Zahab, many containing two or three families. Groups clustered around bonfires trying to warm themselves.  It is cold. My children are freezing. We have water and food but no tent. The quake did not kill us but the cold weather will kill us,  a woman in her 30s said.   The mayor of the city of Ezgeleh said 80 percent of its buildings had collapsed. Survivors desperately needed tents with elderly people and babies as young as a one-year-old sleeping in the cold for two straight nights.  People are hungry and thirsty,  a local man told ISNA news agency.  There is no electricity. Last night I cried when I saw children with no food or shelter.   Some people were angry that among the collapsed buildings were homes built under an affordable housing scheme initiated in 2011 by then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.   The people should build their own houses. They build better houses than those built under projects and schemes,  Rouhani said in Kermanshah, state TV reported.  I promise you, those responsible will be punished.  Iran is crisscrossed by major geological fault lines and has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years, including a 6.6 quake in 2003 that reduced the historic southeastern city of Bam to dust and killed some 31,000 people.

"November 14, 2017 "," (This November 15 story was corrected to clarify in paragraph three that not all people evacuated were fighters) ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey on Tuesday said it was appalled by the approach of the U.S. Department of Defense towards an agreement between the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and Islamic State to withdraw Islamic State militants from the Syrian city of Raqqa. Last month, a YPG militia spokesman said that Syrian Islamic State fighters were set to abandon Raqqa in a withdrawal agreed with U.S.-backed Syrian militias. On Sunday, a report by the BBC said some 4,000 people, including hundreds of foreign nationals, had been evacuated from Raqqa as part of the agreement and spread across Syria and as far as Turkey.  Seeing that statements from the spokespeople of the international coalition against Islamic State and the U.S. Department of Defence have not denied the existence of the given agreement, but to the contrary said they  respected  it is appalling,  Turkey s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Ankara has been infuriated with Washington over its support of the YPG militia, seen by Turks as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by Ankara, the United States and European Union. The ministry said the withdrawal of Islamic State militants from Raqqa was  extremely troubling , and added that it was a development that  should be noted .   The agreement in question has become an example that if a battle is carried out with a terrorist organization, those terrorist organizations will eventually opt to cooperate with each other,  it said. After Raqqa s fall to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in October, Syria s army declared victory over Islamic State last week, saying its capture of the jihadists  last town of Albu Kamal marked the collapse of their three-year, hardline reign in the region.

"November 16, 2017 ","SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile s presidential hopefuls wrapped up campaigning on Thursday in a race that has pitted billionaire Sebastian Pinera s promise for change against center-left candidate Alejandro Guillier s defense of a recent raft of progressive reforms. With their six rivals trailing far behind, Pinera and Guillier are widely expected to place first and second, respectively, in Sunday s election, allowing them to move on to an eventual Dec. 17 run-off. Pinera, a 67-year-old former president, has portrayed himself as the best bet for reviving growth that has slowed in recent years in the world s No.1 copper producer. He has vowed to cut the corporate tax rate and scale back outgoing President Michelle Bachelet s tax, labor and education reforms that Guillier has vowed to deepen. Bachelet cannot run for office again because of term limits.  Chileans face an important decision. They re going to have to choose between change or continuity,  Pinera told journalists on Thursday on the last day for campaigning before the election. Guillier, a bearded former journalist-turned-Senator, has tapped concerns that Pinera would mark a setback for gains made in Bachelet s government for students, women and workers - from lowered university fees to laws that have empowered unions.  This is an election to define the two Chiles,  Guillier said.  Support for education, health care and rights, or a return to the market.  Neither candidate marks a sharp departure from the historically moderate leaders that have governed Chile since the country s transition to democracy from dictatorship in 1990. But if Pinera wins as expected, this year s election would mark another rightward shift in South America following the rise of conservative leaders in Peru, Argentina and Brazil. Pinera s and Guillier s rivals passed out leaflets and chatted up voters in a final bid to shore up support, or at least help their parties win seats in the next Congress. Analyst group Tresquintos said leftist candidate Beatriz Sanchez, a distant third in opinion polls, has zero chance of catching up to Guillier. The probability of Pinera securing at least 50 percent of votes needed to avoid a runoff election was only slightly better at 0.001 percent, it added in an email. Still, riding high with more than double Guillier s support in recent polls, Pinera urged Chileans to  make it short  and vote for him on Sunday to give him an outright win.

"November 17, 2017 ","TORONTO (Reuters) - A former Canadian police chief and several colleagues who fought against making marijuana use legal have switched sides and embraced the looming legalization of cannabis with a leap into business. With Canada s legalization of a multi-billion dollar marijuana industry set for next year, former police officers who once argued for mandatory jail time for minor marijuana offences are among those in line to capitalize on the change. The most high profile is Julian Fantino, a former Toronto police chief and Conservative cabinet minister who fought against the legalization of pot and who said he now sees the value of a legal medical pot industry.  For a lot of us, until you get into this thing, all we know is the stigma associated with marijuana. And there is that, of course, but ... it s only a matter of time, before it becomes a recognized, therapeutic, prescribed drug,  Fantino said in an interview. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to legalize recreational marijuana use in his 2015 election campaign and new legislation will let adults grow, buy or possess small amounts of marijuana as of July 1, 2018. Under the new law, private or government retailers will be able to sell marijuana and licensed producers will be able to grow it. The Canadian cannabis black market is estimated to be worth between C$7 billion ($5.77 billion) and C$10 billion a year, with rates of youth use among the highest in the world. Analysts expect it will take time for legal trade to push aside unsanctioned competition. Fantino and his partners - a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, a former fire chief and a former member of parliament - are promoting their company Aleafia, which provides patients with authorizations for medical marijuana, as well as other medical services. Medical marijuana is already legal. Fantino said he would  absolutely  be pursuing the business even if Canada was not legalizing the lucrative recreational industry. But his change of heart has met with skepticism in some circles. Toronto Star newspaper columnist Royson James wrote  the hypocrisy stinks to high heaven.  On Twitter, pot activist Jodie Emery called the news  infuriating.   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp introduced an interview with Fantino by noting he had  once compared weed to murder.  Fantino said the quote was taken out of context and he  did what I could to apply the laws of the land with conscience.  Other ex-cops are getting into the business side of marijuana. Former deputy Toronto police chief Kim Derry has been involved in medical marijuana businesses since 2012. Derry is president of Met-Scan Canada, which he said provides security for about half a dozen marijuana growers. He expects that number to grow once recreational production becomes legal.  From a background of criminal activity, I certainly know how (grow operations) operated in the past,  Derry said.  I know all the pieces, through a chain of supply, where there s weaknesses.  The government s effort to legalize marijuana is headed up by another former Toronto police chief, Bill Blair, who succeeded Fantino in 2005 before they both turned to politics. Blair said retired police officers have been getting calls for advice on medical marijuana production since related laws came into effect in 2013.   I think many are being sought out for their expertise in public service and regulatory law and security around these things,  he said, adding he does not think its unseemly for police officers to make money off cannabis.  For me, it s entirely consistent with my life s work and I wouldn t comment on anyone else s history or motives.  Pot possession remains illegal until July and Canadians continue to be prosecuted for it - 17,733 people in 2016, according to Statistics Canada. Studies have found marginalized communities are disproportionately targeted. The government is developing ways to track each marijuana plant from seed to point of sale and test for quality. It has yet to draft detailed advertising rules or finalize tax levels. ","As Canada prepares for legal pot, ex-cops get into the business"
"November 18, 2017 ","DUBLIN (Reuters) - Sinn Fein s Gerry Adams, a pivotal figure in the political life of Ireland for almost 50 years, said on Saturday he will step down as party leader and complete a generational shift in the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Reviled by many as the face of the IRA during its campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland, Adams reinvented himself as a peacemaker in the troubled region and then as a populist opposition parliamentarian in the Irish Republic. Adams said he would be replaced as party president, a position he has held since 1983, at a party conference next year. He would also not stand for reelection to the Irish parliament.  Republicanism has never been stronger... But leadership means knowing when it is time for change. That time is now,  Adams said in an emotional speech to a packed party conference.  I have complete confidence in the next generation of leaders,  he said.  Adams stayed on stage as the 2,500-strong crowd, some in tears, gave him a standing ovation and sang a traditional Irish song about the road home, followed by the national anthem.  Adams will almost certainly hand over to a successor with no direct involvement in the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland, a prospect that would make Sinn Fein a more palatable coalition partner in the Irish Republic where it has never been in power. Deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald, an English literature graduate from Trinity College Dublin who has been at the forefront of a new breed of Sinn Fein politicians transforming the party s image, is the clear favourite to take over. That would mean the left-wing party being led on both sides of the Irish border by women in their 40s after Michelle O Neill succeeded Martin McGuinness as leader in Northern Ireland shortly before the former IRA commander s death in March. Adams, who will turn 70 next October, has always denied membership of the IRA but accusations from former IRA fighters that he was involved in its campaign of killings have dogged him throughout his career.  Adams was a key figure in the nationalist movement throughout the three decades of violence between Catholic militants seeking a united Ireland, mainly Protestant militants who wanted to maintain Northern Ireland s position as a part of Britain, and the British army.  3,600 died in the conflict, many at the hands of the IRA. As head of the political wing of the IRA during its bombing campaigns in 1980s Britain, Adams was a pariah and banned from speaking on British airwaves, forcing television stations to dub his voice with that of an actor. He and his party emerged from the political cold in October 1997 when he shook hands with Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair at their first meeting. A year later, he helped win sceptical elements in the IRA to the Good Friday peace deal, which largely ended the violence. Since the peace deal Adams and McGuinness turned Sinn Fein from a fringe party into the dominant Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland and the third largest party in south of the border. While its anti-austerity platform led to a six-fold increase in its number of seats in the Republic - 23 out of 158 -  suspicion of Sinn Fein s role in the Northern Ireland troubles still runs deep and the far larger ruling Fine Gael and or main opposition Fianna Fail have ruled out governing alongside them. Analysts say a change of leader could help open the way to Sinn Fein entering government in Dublin for the first time.   Under a new Sinn Fein leader I think anything is possible,  said David Farrell, politics professor at University College Dublin.  A new Sinn Fein leader will also take over responsibility for rescuing power-sharing devolved government in Northern Ireland and avoid a return to full direct rule from London for the first time in decade.

"November 19, 2017 ","BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would prefer a new election to ruling with a minority after talks on forming a three-way coalition failed overnight, but Germany s president told parties they owed it to voters to try to form a government. The major obstacle to a three-way deal was immigration, according to Merkel, who was forced into negotiations after bleeding support in the Sept. 24 election to the far right in a backlash at her 2015 decision to let in over 1 million migrants. The failure of exploratory coalition talks involving her conservative bloc, the liberal pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens raises the prospect of a new election and casts doubt about her future after 12 years in power. Merkel, 63, said she was sceptical about ruling in a minority government, telling ARD television:  My point of view is that new elections would be the better path.  Her plans did not include being chancellor in a minority government, she said after meeting President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Steinmeier said Germany was facing the worst governing crisis in the 68-year history of its post-World War Two democracy and pressed all parties in parliament  to serve our country  and try to form a government. His remarks appeared aimed at the FDP and the Social Democrats (SPD), who on Monday ruled out renewing their  grand coalition  with the conservatives.  Inside our country, but also outside, in particular in our European neighbourhood, there would be concern and a lack of understanding if politicians in the biggest and economically strongest country (in Europe) did not live up to their responsibilities,  read a statement from Steinmeier, a former foreign minister who has been thrust centre-stage after taking on the usually largely ceremonial head of state role in March. Steinmeier s intervention suggests he regards a new election - desired by half of Germany s voters according to a poll - as a last resort. The SPD has so far stuck to a pledge after heavy losses in the September election not to go back into a Merkel-led broad coalition of centre-left and centre-right. Merkel urged the SPD to reconsider.  I would hope that they consider very intensively if they should take on the responsibility  of governing, she told broadcaster ZDF, adding she saw no reason to resign and her conservative bloc would enter any new election more unified than before.  If new elections happened, then ... we have to accept that. I m afraid of nothing,  she said. Business leaders also called for a swift return to talks. With German leadership seen as crucial for a European Union grappling with governance reform and Britain s impending exit, FDP leader Christian Lindner s announcement that he was pulling out spooked investors and sent the euro falling in the morning. Both the euro and European shares later recovered from early selling, while German bond yields steadied near 1-1/2 week lows, as confidence about the outlook for the euro zone economy helped investors brush off worries about the risk of Germany going to the polls again soon.  FEAR OF FAR-RIGHT GAINS Earlier, Merkel got the strong backing of her CDU leadership. Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of Germany weekly Die Zeit said she could rely on CDU support for now, but added:  I will not bet on her serving out her entire four-year term.  The main parties fear another election so soon would let the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party add to the 13 percent of votes it secured in September, when it entered parliament for the first time. Polls suggest a repeat election would return a similarly fragmented parliament. A poll published on Monday showed a new election would bring roughly the same result as the September election, with the Greens set to see the biggest gains. If Germans voted next Sunday, Merkel s conservatives would get 31 percent, the SPD 21 percent, the Greens and the AfD both 12 percent, the FDP 10 percent and the Left party 9 percent, the Forsa survey for RTL television showed. This compares with the election result of 32.9 percent for the conservatives, 20.5 percent for the SPD, 12.6 percent for AfD, 10.7 percent for FDP, 9.2 percent for the Left party and 8.9 percent for the Greens.  The failure of coalition talks is unprecedented in Germany s post-war history, and was likened by newsmagazine Der Spiegel to the shock election of U.S. President Donald Trump or Britain s referendum vote to leave the EU - moments when countries cast aside reputations for stability built up over decades. Any outcome in Germany is, however, likely to be more consensus driven.  The problem is stagnation and immobility, not instability as in Italy,  said Joffe. The unravelling of the German talks came as a surprise since the main sticking points - immigration and climate policy - were not seen as FDP signature issues. Responding to criticism from the Greens, FDP vice chairman Wolfgang Kubicki said a tie-up would have been short-lived.  Nothing would be worse than to get into a relationship about which we know that it will end in a dirty divorce,  he said.  Even if the SPD or the FDP revisit their decisions, the price for either party to change its mind could be the departure of Merkel, who since 2005 has been a symbol of German stability, leading Europe through the euro zone crisis. The inability to form a government caused disquiet elsewhere in Europe, not least because of the implications for the euro zone reforms championed by French President Emmanuel Macron. Germany s political impasse could also complicate and potentially delay the Brexit negotiations - Britain has just over a year to strike a divorce deal with the EU ahead of an exit planned for March 29, 2019.   It s not in our interests that the process freezes up,  Macron told reporters in Paris, adding he had spoken with Merkel shortly after the failure of talks.

"November 20, 2017 ","HARARE (Reuters) - Robert Mugabe resigned as Zimbabwe s president on Tuesday, a week after the army and his former political allies moved to end four decades of rule by a man once feted as an independence hero who became feared as a despot. His former vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking this month prompted the military takeover that forced Mugabe out, will be sworn in as president on Wednesday or Thursday, Patrick Chinamasa, legal secretary of the ruling ZANU-PF party, told Reuters. The 93-year-old Mugabe had clung on for a week after an army takeover, with ZANU-PF urging him to go. He finally resigned moments after parliament began an impeachment process seen as the only legal way to force him out. Wild celebrations broke out at a joint sitting of parliament when Speaker Jacob Mudenda read out Mugabe s brief resignation letter. Mugabe, confined to his Harare residence, did not appear.  People danced in the streets of Harare and car horns blared at the news that the era of Mugabe   who had led Zimbabwe since independence in 1980   was finally over. Some brandished posters of Mnangagwa and army chief General Constantino Chiwenga.   Workers turned the Christmas lights on early in Africa Unity Square and people climbed aboard armored vehicles to pose for photographs with soldiers. Despite the public outpouring of joy, Mugabe s downfall was as much the result of in-fighting among the political elite as a popular uprising, although thousands of people rallied against him in the days after the army intervened last week.     The army seized power after Mugabe sacked Mnangagwa, ZANU-PF s favorite to succeed him, in a bid to smooth a path to the presidency for his wife Grace, 52, known to her critics as  Gucci Grace  for her reputed fondness for luxury shopping. Since the crisis began, Mugabe has been mainly confined to his  Blue Roof  mansion in the capital where Grace is also believed to be. ZANU-PF chief whip Lovemore Matuke told Reuters that Mnangagwa would be sworn in within 48 hours and serve the remainder of Mugabe s term until the next election, which must be held by September 2018.      I am very happy with what has happened,  said Maria Sabawu, a supporter of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), outside the hotel where the impeachment process was happening.  I have suffered a lot at the hands of Mugabe s government,  she said, showing her hand with a missing finger that she said was lost in violence during a presidential run-off election between Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2008. Mugabe had led Zimbabwe since a guerrilla struggle ended white-minority rule in the country formerly known as Rhodesia. He took the once-rich nation to economic ruin, presiding over the forced takeover of white-owned farms at the end of the century, which devastated agricultural foreign exchange earnings and led to hyperinflation. But brandishing his anti-colonial credentials and styling himself the Grand Old Man of African politics, Mugabe retained the admiration of many people across the continent. Amnesty International said that under Mugabe tens of thousands of people were tortured, forcibly disappeared or killed in a culture of impunity that allowed  grotesque crimes to thrive .  The people of Zimbabwe deserve better. The next generation of leaders must commit itself to upholding the constitution, living up to Zimbabwe s international human rights obligations and treating its people with dignity and justice,  the rights group said in a statement.  Mnangagwa, 75, who fled Zimbabwe after his sacking in fear for his safety, was a chief lieutenant to Mugabe for decades and himself stands accused of participating in repression. He was internal security chief in the mid-1980s when Mugabe deployed a North Korean-trained brigade against rebels during which 20,000 civilians were killed, according to rights groups. Reuters reported in September that Mnangagwa was plotting to succeed Mugabe, with army backing, at the helm of a broad coalition to seek Zimbabwe s re-engagement with the world after decades of isolation from global lenders and donors. Nicknamed  Ngwena , or crocodile in the Shona language, an animal famed in Zimbabwean lore for its stealth and ruthlessness, Mnangagwa issued a statement from hiding on Tuesday calling on Zimbabweans to unite to rebuild the country. Opposition politician and former education minister David Coltart said that call gave hope of lifting a shattered economy from its knees, provided Mnangagwa made good on his promise to reach out to other factions.  When we all wake up with hangovers tomorrow, we will be reminded of the dreadful state our nation is in - no money in the banks and businesses collapsing,  Coltart told Reuters.  As Emmerson Mnangagwa said, ZANU-PF is not capable of resolving this issue on its own. I took some comfort from his words. If he translates them into action, the future is positive.  Zimbabwe s Platform for Concerned Citizens, a civil society group, called for a national dialogue and a  transitional authority  to decide the country s future. Theresa May, prime minister of former colonial power Britain, said Mugabe s resignation  provides Zimbabwe with an opportunity to forge a new path free of the oppression that characterized his rule . She said Britain, as  Zimbabwe s oldest friend , would do all it could to support the country.      The U.S. embassy in Harare said Zimbabwe was living  a historic moment .  Whatever short-term arrangements the government may establish, the path forward must lead to free, fair and inclusive elections,  it said in a statement.

"November 21, 2017 ","THE HAGUE (Reuters) - A U.N. tribunal on Wednesday convicted ex-Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic of genocide and crimes against humanity for massacres of Bosnian Muslims and ethnic cleansing campaigns to forge a  Greater Serbia , and jailed him for life. Mladic was hustled out of the court minutes before the verdict for angrily shouting,  This is all lies, you are all liars!  The outburst occurred after Mladic returned to the courtroom from what his lawyers described as a visit to the bathroom, then a blood pressure test which held up proceedings. The U.N. Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) found Mladic guilty of 10 of 11 charges, including the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica and the 43-month siege of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, in which more than 10,000 civilians were killed by shelling, mortar and sniper fire. The killings in Srebrenica of men and boys after they were separated from women and taken away in buses or marched off to be shot amounted to Europe s worst atrocity since World War Two.   The crimes committed rank among the most heinous known to humankind, and include genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity,  Presiding Judge Alphons Orie said in reading out a summary of the judgment.  Many of these men and boys were cursed, insulted, threatened, forced to sing Serb songs and beaten while awaiting their execution,  he said. Mladic had pleaded not guilty to all charges. His legal team said he would appeal against the verdict. Called the  Butcher of Bosnia  by survivors of his actions, Mladic was the most notorious of 163 ICTY indictees together with Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb nationalist leader and political mastermind of ethnic cleansing, and their patron, then-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The tribunal found Mladic  significantly contributed  to genocide committed in Srebrenica with the goal of destroying its Muslim population,  personally directed  the bombardment of Sarajevo and was part of a  joint criminal enterprise  aimed at purging Bosnian Muslims and Catholic Croats from Bosnia.  Prosecutors said the ultimate agenda of Mladic, Karadzic and Milosevic was what came to be known worldwide as ethnic cleansing, to carve out an Orthodox  Greater Serbia  in the ashes of multinational federal Yugoslavia. ICTY Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz called the verdict  a milestone  in holding Mladic accountable not just for massacres but the detention of tens of thousands of non-Serbs in camps where many were beaten and raped, and the forced displacement of over one million to remake Bosnia s demographic map. The Mladic case is the last major decision by the ICTY, which plans to close its doors soon after sentencing 83 Balkan war criminals since opening in 1993. In Geneva, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein called Mladic the  epitome of evil  and said his conviction after 16 years as an indicted fugitive and five years of trial was a  momentous victory for justice .   Today s verdict is a warning to the perpetrators of such crimes that they will not escape justice, no matter how powerful they may be nor how long it may take,  Zeid said in a statement.  RESPECT THE VICTIMS, LOOK TO THE FUTURE  -SERBIA President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, whose 1990s strongman leader Milosevic died in a tribunal prison in 2006 before the end of his genocide trial, said Serbia  respects the victims .   I would like to call on everyone (in the region) to start looking into the future and not to drown in tears of the past... We need to look to the future...so we finally have a stable country,  Vucic told reporters when asked about the verdict. Serbia, once the most powerful Yugoslav republic, is now democratic and seeking ties to the European Union. Bosnian Prime Minister Denis Zvizdic said he hoped that  those who still call for new divisions and conflicts will carefully read the verdict rendered today ...in case that they are still no ready to face their past . He was alluding to enduring separatism in post-war federal Bosnia s autonomous Serb region. Srebrenica, near Bosnia s eastern border with Serbia, had been designated a  safe area  by the United Nations and was defended by lightly armed U.N. peacekeepers. But they quickly surrendered when Mladic s forces stormed it on July 11, 1995. A bronzed and beefy Mladic was filmed visiting a refugee camp in Srebrenica on July 12.  He was giving away chocolate and sweets to the children while the cameras were rolling, telling us nothing will happen and that we have no reason to be afraid,  recalled Munira Subasic of the Mothers of Srebrenica group. Serbian TV footage showed Mladic approaching a blond boy in a friendly way and asking him his name and how old he was, then turning to fearful Muslim women and children and assuring them:  All who would like to stay can stay. Just take it easy.   Subasic said:  After the cameras left he gave an order to kill whoever could be killed, rape whoever could be raped and finally he ordered us all to be banished and chased out of Srebrenica, so he could make an  ethnically clean  town.  Dutch peacekeepers looked on helplessly as Bosnian Serb officers separated men and boys from women, then sent them out of sight on buses or marched them away to be shot. The remains of Subasic s son and husband were both found in mass graves by International Commission of Missing Persons (ICMP) workers. The ICMP have identified some 6,900 remains of Srebrenica victims through DNA analysis. The siege of Sarajevo terrorised its people. It involved both heavy shelling that sometimes slaughtered residents queueing outside for scarce supplies, and random sniper fire that picked off people who dared to venture into the streets, or even as they stood indoors by exposed windows. In May 1992, as artillery barrages from surrounding hillsides were setting Sarajevo ablaze, Bosnian intelligence intercepted a Mladic phone call in which he was giving orders about targets:  Fire on the parliament, presidency, the Old Town. Fire so that they cannot sleep, burn their brains!  That phone call was entered as evidence in his trial. Mladic is still seen as a national hero by some compatriots for the swift capture of much of Bosnia after its Serbs rose up against an early 1992 referendum vote by Muslims and Croats for independence from Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia.  His lawyers will argue in their appeal that Bosnian Serbs were  victims  of the referendum and fought in  self-defence . Mladic s lawyers contended that Sarajevo was a legitimate military target as it was the main bastion of Muslim-led Bosnian government forces. They also asserted that Mladic left Srebrenica shortly before Serb fighters began executing Muslim detainees and was later shocked to find out they had occurred. But Wednesday s verdict was never much in doubt, given the mountain of evidence of Serb atrocities produced at previous trials. Four of Mladic s subordinates received life sentences. Karadzic, 72, was convicted of genocide in 2016 and sentenced to 40 years. He is appealing. Mladic was indicted along with Karadzic in 1995, shortly after the Srebrenica killings. But he evaded capture until 2011, three years after a heavily disguised Karadzic was arrested. Mladic s trial in The Hague took five years in part because of delays due to his poor health. He has suffered several strokes, but the ICTY rejected a flurry of last-minute attempts by his lawyers to put off the verdict on medical grounds. The ICTY indicted 161 people in all from Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. Of the 83 convicted, more than 60 of them were ethnic Serbs.

"November 22, 2017 ","HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s new leader Emmerson Mnangagwa told a cheering crowd in Harare on Wednesday that the country was entering a new stage of democracy following Robert Mugabe s removal as president after nearly four decades in power. Mnangagwa returned to the country earlier in the day, having fled for his safety when the 93-year-old former leader sacked him as vice president two weeks ago to smooth a path to the succession for his much younger wife Grace.   The people have spoken. The voice of the people is the voice of God,  Mnangagwa told thousands of supporters gathered outside the ruling ZANU-PF party s offices in the capital.  Today we are witnessing the beginning of a new and unfolding democracy.  Zimbabwe was once one of Africa s most promising economies but suffered decades of decline as Mugabe pursued policies that included the violent seizure of white-owned commercial farms and money-printing that led to hyperinflation.  Most of its 16 million people remain poor and face currency shortages and sky-high unemployment, something Mnangagwa promised to address.   We want to grow our economy, we want peace in our country, we want jobs, jobs, jobs,  he told the crowd, adding:  The will of the people will always, always succeed.   Mnangagwa s dismissal was the trigger for the army and former political allies to move against Mugabe, feted as an independence hero when Zimbabwe broke with former colonial power Britain in 1980 but later feared as a despot. He resigned as president on Tuesday as parliament began an impeachment process, after resisting pressure to do so for a week. People danced in the streets following his downfall, some brandishing posters of Mnangagwa and army chief General Constantino Chiwenga, who led the takeover. Parliamentary speaker Jacob Mudenda said on Wednesday that Mnangagwa would be sworn in as president on Friday after being nominated by ZANU-PF to fill the vacancy left by Mugabe. The demise of Mugabe leaves Zimbabwe in a different situation to a number of other African countries where veteran leaders have been toppled in popular uprisings or through elections. The army appears to have engineered a trouble-free path to power for Mnangagwa, who was for decades a faithful lieutenant of Mugabe and member of his elite. He was also in charge of internal security when rights groups say 20,000 civilians were killed in the 1980s.  Mugabe has gone but I don t see Mnangagwa doing anything different from that old man. This is not the change I expected but let us give him time,  said security guard Edgar Mapuranga, who sat by a bank cash machine that was out of money. Restoring the country s fortunes and international standing will be a challenge. Alleged human rights abuses and flawed elections prompted many Western countries to impose sanctions in the early 2000s that further hurt the economy, even with Chinese investment to soften the blow. Staging clean elections next year will be key to winning fresh funds. Although Mnangagwa is almost certain to win any vote, German Chancellor Angela Merkel s personal representative for Africa, Guenther Nooke, said it would be a victory for Zimbabwe s  old elites  with the help of China.   He will manage to get elected using fear or many tricks, and then we ll have a succession from one tyrant to the next,  Nooke told broadcaster SWR2. China s foreign ministry said on Wednesday it respected Mugabe s decision to resign. In London, Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain wanted Zimbabwe to rejoin the international community now that Mugabe has resigned. Mnangagwa met neighboring South Africa s President Jacob Zuma before his return on Wednesday. Mugabe is one of the last of a generation of African leaders who led their countries to independence and then ruled, among them Ghana s Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, Felix Houphouet-Boigny in Ivory Coast and South Africa s Nelson Mandela. The African Union said he would be remembered  as a fearless pan-Africanist liberation fighter and the father of the independent Zimbabwean nation  and that his decision to step down would enhance his legacy.     But he also stifled democracy en route to winning a series of elections. His government is accused by the opposition and human rights groups of persecuting and killing opponents. The forced takeover of white-owned farms from around 2000 aimed to bolster his popular support but crippled foreign exchange earnings from agriculture. Mnangagwa s human rights record also stirs hostility in many Zimbabweans.  The dark past is not going to disappear. They will be following him around like a piece of chewing gum on his shoe,  International Crisis Group s southern Africa senior consultant Piers Pigou said.  For him to really be seen to be doing the right thing, he s going to have to introduce policies that fundamentally undermine the power structures of ZANU-PF, through a shift to genuine political pluralism and a decoupling of the party and state.

"November 23, 2017 ","HARARE (Reuters) - New President Emmerson Mnangagwa laid out a grand vision on Friday to revitalise Zimbabwe s ravaged economy and vowed to rule on behalf of all the country s citizens. Sworn in days after the overthrow of Robert Mugabe, the 75-year-old former security chief promised to guarantee the rights of foreign investors and to re-engage with the West, and said elections would go ahead next year as scheduled. In a 30-minute speech to tens of thousands of supporters in Harare s national stadium, Mnangagwa extended an olive branch to opponents, apparently aiming to bridge the ethnic and political divides exploited by his predecessor during his 37 years in charge.  I intend, nay, am required, to serve our country as the president of all citizens, regardless of color, creed, religion, tribe or political affiliation,  he said, in a speech that also hailed the voice of the people as the  voice of god . Behind the rhetoric, some Zimbabweans wonder whether a man who loyally served Mugabe for decades can bring change to a ruling establishment accused of systematic human rights abuses and disastrous economic policies. He made clear that the land reforms that sparked the violent seizure of thousands of white-owned farms from 2000 would not be reversed, but promised that those who lost property would receive compensation. To some political opponents, the speech was a welcome contrast with the habitual belligerence of Mugabe and appeared to be drawing on Mnangagwa s knowledge and understanding of China as a model for running an economy.  His model has been the Chinese,  said David Coltart, a former education minister and MP from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.  He will drive to make Zimbabwe a more attractive investment location, and more efficient, but like China will not tolerate dissent. If you  behave , you will be secure.  Those skeptical about the new president s commitment to change question his role in the so-called Gukurahundi massacres in Matabeleland in 1983, when an estimated 20,000 people were killed in a crackdown on Mugabe s opponents by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade. Mnangagwa was in charge of internal security at the time, but has denied any part in the atrocities. Many Zimbabweans, especially the ethnic Ndebele who bore the brunt of the Gukurahundi slaughter, will see his appeal on Friday to  let bygones be bygones  as an attempt to gloss over his nation s darkest chapter. Some critics have alleged harsh treatment by soldiers of opponents of the military intervention last week  -  a de facto coup against Mugabe, 93, and his 52-year-old wife Grace. Axed finance minister Ignatius Chombo was in hospital with injuries sustained from beatings during a week in military custody, his lawyer told Reuters. He was blindfolded throughout his time in detention, Lovemore Madhuku said.  It was a very brutal and draconian way of dealing with opponents,  he added. Asked to comment, police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said she had no information about Chombo.  Separately, High Court Judge President George Chiweshe ruled that the military intervention last week was legal, following an application brought by two citizens who petitioned the court to confirm the military had been right to do what they did. Since his return to Zimbabwe this month after fleeing a Mugabe-led purge, Mnangagwa has been preaching democracy, tolerance and respect for the rule of law. Along with Mugabe, Grace - Mnangagwa s sworn enemy - has been granted immunity from prosecution and had her safety guaranteed, part of a deal that led to Mugabe s resignation on Tuesday, sources close to the negotiations said. For decades Mnangagwa was a faithful aide to Mugabe, who was widely accused of repression of dissent and election-rigging and under whose rule one of Africa s once most prosperous economies was wrecked by hyperinflation and mass emigration.  Mnangagwa earned the nickname  Ngwena , Shona for crocodile, an animal famed and feared in Zimbabwean lore for stealth and ruthlessness. In his speech, Mnangagwa called for the removal of Western sanctions and said he wanted to  hit the ground running . He appeared to have initial support from neighboring states. South African President Jacob Zuma said he hoped he would steer Zimbabwe successfully through the transition from Mugabe s rule. The Southern African Development Community, an intergovernmental organization, said it was ready to work closely with Mnangagwa s government. Zimbabweans listening to his speech said they were prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, but were also realistic about the chances of injecting life into an economy with 90 percent unemployment and banks devoid of cash. In the last 15 years, an estimated 3 million have emigrated to neighboring South Africa in search of a better life.  I wanted to see for myself that Mugabe has really gone. He is the only president I ve known,  said 33-year-old Lenin Tongoona.  We have a new president who may try something a little different to improve the economy. I m excited today but tomorrow is uncertain because we don t know how he will turn out. He talks about creating jobs. How does he plan to do that?

"November 24, 2017 ","CAIRO (Reuters) - Gunmen who attacked a mosque on Friday in Egypt s North Sinai brandished an Islamic State flag as they opened fire through doorways and windows, killing more than 300 worshippers, including two dozen children, officials said on Saturday. No group has claimed responsibility, but Egyptian forces are battling a stubborn Islamic State affiliate in the region, one of the surviving branches of the militant group after it suffered defeats by U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and Syria. The assault on a mosque has stunned Egyptians, prompting President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi s government to tighten security at places of worship and key buildings, and call three days of mourning for the bloodiest attack in Egypt s modern history.  State news agency MENA said the death toll had risen to 305, including 27 children, and 128 people were injured. Egypt s public prosecutor s office, citing interviews with wounded survivors as part of its investigation, linked Islamic State militants, also known as Daesh, to the attack on the Al Rawdah mosque in Bir al-Abed, west of El-Arish city.  The worshippers were taken by surprise by these elements,  the prosecutor said in a statement.  They numbered between 25 and 30, carrying the Daesh flag and took up positions in front of the mosque door and its 12 windows with automatic rifles.  The gunmen, some wearing masks and military-style uniforms, had arrived in jeeps, surrounded the mosque and opened fire inside, sending panicked worshippers scrambling over each other to escape the carnage. Witnesses had said gunmen set off a bomb at the end of Friday prayers and then opened fire as people tried to flee, shooting at ambulances and setting fire to cars to block roads. Images on state media showed bloodied victims and bodies covered in blankets inside the mosque.  When the shooting began everyone was running, and everyone was bumping into one another,  Magdy Rezk, a wounded survivor, said from his hospital bed.  But I was able to make out masked men wearing military clothing.  Striking a mosque would be a shift in tactics for the Sinai militants, who have previously attacked troops and police and more recently tried to spread their insurgency to the mainland by hitting Christian churches and pilgrims. Local sources said some of the worshippers were Sufis, whom groups such as Islamic State consider targets because they revere saints and shrines, which for Islamists is tantamount to idolatry. Islamic State has targeted Sufi and Shi ite Muslims in other countries like Iraq. The jihadists in Egypt s Sinai have also attacked local tribes and their militias for working with the army and police. Sisi, a former armed forces commander who supporters see as a bulwark against Islamist militants, promised the  utmost force  against those responsible for Friday s attack. Security has been a key reason for his supporters to back him, and he is expected to run for re-election next year. Egypt s military carried out air strikes and raids overnight to target hideouts and vehicles involved in the attack, the army said, without giving details on the number of militants.  What is happening is an attempt to stop us from our efforts in the fight against terrorism,  Sisi said on Friday. The Sinai attack came as Sisi s government looks to draw more foreign investment and finish an IMF reform program to help revive an economy that struggled through instability after the 2011 uprising ousted long-standing leader Hosni Mubarak. North Sinai, a mostly desert area stretching from the Suez Canal eastwards to the Gaza Strip and Israel, has long been a security headache for Egypt and is a strategic region for Cairo because of its sensitive borders. Local militant group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, once allied to al Qaeda, split from it and declared allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. But attacks in the Sinai worsened after 2013 when Sisi led the overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood after mass protests against his rule.

"November 25, 2017 ","DENPASAR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian and regional authorities heightened flight warnings around Bali s Mount Agung on Sunday as the volcano s eruptions sent a plume of volcanic ash and steam more than 6,000 metres into the skies above the popular holiday island. Ash covered roads, cars and buildings near the volcano in the northeast of the island, while scores of flights were cancelled and overnight a red glow of what appeared to be magma could be seen in photographs by Antara, the state news agency.  The activity of Mount Agung has entered the magmatic eruption phase. It is still spewing ash at the moment but we need to monitor and be cautious over the possibility of a strong, explosive eruption,  said Gede Suantika, an official at the volcanology and geological disaster mitigation agency. Bali, famous for its surf, beaches and temples, attracted nearly 5 million visitors last year but business has slumped in areas around the volcano since September when Agung s volcanic tremors began to increase. Agung rises majestically over eastern Bali at a height of just over 3,000 metres. When it last erupted in 1963 it killed more than 1,000 people and razed several villages. Australia s Bureau of Meteorology s Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VACC) in Darwin issued maps showing an ash cloud heading southeast over the neighbouring island of Lombok, away from  Bali s capital, Denpasar, where the main international airport is located. Indonesia also upgraded its Volcano Observatory Notice for Aviation (VONA) to red, its highest warning, and said the ash-cloud top could reach 19,654 feet (6,142 metres) or higher.  However, officials said the airport would remain open for now as the ash could be avoided.  The volcanic ash has only been detected in a certain area,  the airport and other officials said in a joint statement. All domestic flights and the airport itself were operating as  normal  and tests for ash had been negative, it said. Yunus Suprayogi, general manager of Bali airport operator Angkasa Pura I, said food and entertainment would be provided as well as extra bus services if conditions changed and passenger numbers increased.  The airport would also  make it easier  for passengers to seek refunds and make other arrangements, he said, while noting that airlines had their own rules. After resuming flights on Sunday morning, Virgin Australia again cancelled flights on Sunday afternoon following a change in the aviation colour code from orange to red.   Due to the significant volcanic ash and current weather conditions, we have made the decision to cancel the rest of today s flights to and from Bali as a precautionary measure,  Virgin said in a statement on its website. AirAsia also cancelled its remaining flights to Bali and Lombok. Qantas and Jetstar flights were continuing as of Sunday afternoon but Jetstar warned on its website that flights could be subject to change at short notice for safety reasons. Indonesia s flag carrier Garuda said it was cancelling all flights to and from Lombok.  Lombok airport was closed late on Sunday afternoon and authorities would assess the situation in the morning, a transport ministry spokesman said.  Indonesia s disaster agency has said Bali is  still safe  for tourists except for a 7.5-kilometre (4.7-mile) zone around Mount Agung.  Despite the string of eruptions, there has not been an increase in volcanic activity,  it said in a statement, noting that the emergency status for Agung remains at level 3, one below the highest. China s Consulate in Denpasar warned citizens on Sunday to  be prepared for the possibility of being stranded  in Bali. ",Bali's erupting volcano raises air travel warnings
"November 26, 2017 ","TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The result of Honduras  presidential election remained in limbo on Tuesday, with a gregarious TV host s surprise lead narrowing sharply, prompting him to call on supporters to take to the streets of the capital to defend the vote. President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who won U.S. praise for helping tackle the flow of migrants and deporting drug cartel leaders, was favored to win before Sunday s vote in the poor Central American nation with one of the world s highest murder rates. But a delayed, partial count on Monday morning pointed toward an unexpected victory for TV entertainer Salvador Nasralla, 64. Inexplicably, election authorities then stopped giving results for more than 24 hours. When, under mounting criticism from international election monitors over a lack of transparency, the electoral tribunal began updating its website again, the tendency rapidly began to change. In a television interview on Tuesday evening, an angry Nasralla said the election was being stolen from him and asked his supporters to flock to the capital, Tegucigalpa, to protest.   We ve already won the election,  he said.  I m not going to tolerate this, and as there are no reliable institutions in Honduras to defend us, tomorrow the Honduran people need to defend the vote on the streets.  The Electoral Observation Mission of the Organization of American States (EOM/OAS) in Honduras urged people to remain calm and wait for official results, which it said should be delivered as quickly and transparently as possible.   The credibility of the electoral authorities and the legitimacy of the future president depend on this,  it said in a statement.   On Tuesday evening, Nasralla s original five-point lead had thinned to under 2 percentage points, with nearly 71 percent of ballots counted, according to the election tribunal. Nasralla said in a later television interview that the election tribunal was only counting ballots from regions where Hernandez had won, skewing the results and giving the false sense that the president was heading for victory. He asked the tribunal to include ballots from regions where he was stronger.  A self-described centrist, Nasralla headed a center-left coalition called the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship, and claimed victory on Monday - as did Hernandez. Election official Marcos Ramiro Lobo told Reuters on Monday afternoon that Nasralla was leading by a margin of five points, with about 70 percent of ballots counted.  Lobo said Nasralla appeared certain to win, signaling that experts at the electoral body regarded his lead as irreversible. On Tuesday, Hernandez reiterated that he had won, and refused to concede, telling supporters they should wait for final results. After Hernandez spoke, thousands of his blue-clad supporters gathered outside the presidential residence to celebrate his supposed victory.  We won the election with Juan Orlando Hernandez, and we won t let them remove him from power,  said 35-year-old housewife Maria Aguirre, who hailed from a rough neighborhood on the outskirts of Tegucigalpa. The election tribunal s delay was due to difficult negotiations between Hernandez s National Party and Nasralla s alliance, according to two European diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity. Behind closed doors, the parties were discussing immunity from prosecution for current officials and how to carve up positions in government, the diplomats said. In an interview on Tuesday, Nasralla denied he was in talks with the National Party. He vowed to review whether to keep a base stationed with U.S. troops if he wins the election, but also promised to deepen security co-operation. Hernandez s National Party appears set to retain control of Congress in the election, giving it the second-most important perch in the country.      The European Union s chief observer for the election, Marisa Matias, urged election officials to maintain an open channel of communication as they finalized the results. The electoral body had been so certain Hernandez would win that it showed unprecedented transparency during the contest, one of the diplomats said. That left the body with little room to maneuver when Nasralla came from nowhere to take a strong lead.         With a booming voice and finely coiffed hair, Nasralla is one of the country s best known faces as the host of game shows that feature scantily clad women by his side.      He is backed by former President Manuel Zelaya, who was ousted in 2009 after he proposed a referendum on his re-election. The possible return to a position of influence for one-time leftist Zelaya risks fuelling concern in Washington. The United States has longstanding military ties to Honduras and few ideological allies among the current crop of Central American presidents. Hernandez, 49, was credited with lowering the murder rate and boosting the economy, but he was also hurt by accusations of ties to illicit, drug-related financing that he denies. His bid for a second term, which was made possible by a 2015 Supreme Court decision on term limits, divided opinion in the coffee-exporting nation of 9 million people.

"November 27, 2017 ","DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland s scandal-hit deputy prime minister resigned on Tuesday, averting a government collapse and potential snap election that had threatened to complicate Brexit talks next month between Britain and the European Union.  Opposition parties had demanded Frances Fitzgerald step down after the release of fresh documents about her disputed handling of a police whistleblower who alleged corruption in the force. Fianna Fail, the main opposition party, which props up Fine Gael Prime Minister Leo Varadkar s minority government, said her resignation meant a December election would be avoided. It had warned it might force a snap poll if Fitzgerald refused to quit.  Today I made the decision to tender my resignation to the Taoiseach (prime minister), stepping down with immediate effect,  Fitzgerald said in a statement.  I have decided on this occasion to put the national interest ahead of my own personal reputation. I believe it is necessary to take this decision to avoid an unwelcome and potentially destabilizing general election at this historically critical time.  Ireland s political crisis exploded in the run-up to a key Brexit summit next month at which Varadkar is set to play a major role. He must tell fellow EU leaders whether he believes sufficient progress has been made on the future of the border between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.  The border   the only land frontier between Britain and the EU   is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly resolved before it decides whether to move talks on Britain s divorce from the EU onto a second phase about trade, as Britain wants. While Varadkar has likely avoided the prospect of having to travel to Brussels in a caretaker capacity, his handling of the crisis has badly damaged him, his governing Fine Gael party and relations with its Fianna Fail opponents. While Fitzgerald s ministerial colleagues continued to back her in public ahead of the cabinet meeting at which she stood down, Tuesday s newspaper front pages were full of quotes from unnamed Fine Gael lawmakers and ministers saying she had to go. Some Fine Gael members who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said they were furious with Varadkar and Fitzgerald s handling of the crisis, having been forced to spend four days strongly defending the deputy prime minister since it broke. Members of the opposition Labour and Sinn Fein parties and political analysts said as Fitzgerald resigned that an election was still likely to follow in the next three or four months.   Whatever happens today, the timeline of this administration is very much foreshortened by the events of the last two weeks,  Labour leader Brendan Howlin told national broadcaster RTE.  I think right now he (Varadkar) has probably lost the dressing room, you can see that in today s newspapers, and he s done some damage to himself and the stability of the government too,  added Howlin, a former cabinet colleague of Varadkar. The crisis was the first major test of the 38-year-old prime minister who succeeded Enda Kenny in June. With a reputation as a straight-talker, he has been likened to French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau by colleagues excited at the prospect of a generational shift. While an opinion poll on Saturday gave Fine Gael a one-point lead over Fianna Fail, bookmaker Paddy Power said on Tuesday that it made Fianna Fail slight favorites to win the most seats at the next election. The two center-right parties are fierce rivals but disagree little on policy. A three-year confidence and supply agreement between them is due to run until this time next year.   I think there is damage (but) nobody is enhanced by this debacle. I don t think either party comes out of it particularly well,  said Theresa Reidy, a politics lecturer at University College Cork, referring to Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.   But Fine Gael are in government so they are more damaged by it.   ","Irish deputy PM resigns, averting election threat"
"November 28, 2017 "," (This November 28 story has been corrected to clarify in headline, lead and third paragraph that the broadcasters will not promote the concerts, not that they had dropped plans to air the concerts) BERLIN (Reuters) - German public broadcasters have dropped plans to promote concerts next year by British ex-Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters, citing what they call  accusations of anti-Semitism against him . Waters, part of one of the world s most critically acclaimed and commercially successful rock bands from 1965-85 before going solo, is a member of the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS) that targets Israel over its occupation of territories where Palestinians seek statehood.   Five state television and radio affiliates of the national ARD network have said they will not promote concerts by the 74-year-old Waters in Berlin and Cologne scheduled next summer  in reaction to anti-Semitism accusations against him , Berlin and Brandenburg public radio (RBB) said. RBB, part of the ARD network, said it wanted to send a message to other artists who, heeding the BDS, refuse to perform in Israel. Waters joined the movement in 2011.  Taking a clear position here is an important signal for RBB to the Jewish communities in Berlin and Brandenburg,  RBB director Patricia Schlesinger said in a statement.  The quick and decisive reaction by the broadcasters ...is an important signal that rampant anti-Semitism against Israel `has no place in Germany,  said Josef Schuster, president of The Central Council of Jews in Germany.  Marek Lieberberg, Waters  tour director, said that German Jews were right to be concerned about  clearly visible and growing anti-Semitism  in Germany - alluding to the far right s surge in recent German elections - but that the broadcasters  decision was  absolutely ridiculous .   Lieberberg, the son of Holocaust survivors, told the Mannheimer Morgen daily that while he rejected the BDS, he separates personal opinions from work.  I cannot and do not want to deny (Waters) his right to freedom of opinion,  he said.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s right-wing government has long campaigned against the BDS, describing it as anti-Semitic and an attempt to erase Israel s legitimacy. The movement, launched in 2005 as a non-violent campaign to press Israel to heed international law and end its occupation of territory held since a 1967 war, has gathered momentum in recent years even if its economic impact remains negligible. Germany has long sought to distance itself from the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust and become one of Israel s closest allies.

"November 29, 2017 ","WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday shared anti-Muslim videos posted on Twitter by a far-right British party leader, drawing condemnation from Britain, U.S. Muslim groups and some members of Congress. The White House defended the retweets by the Republican president, who during the 2016 U.S. election campaign called for  a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,  saying that he was raising security issues. As president, Trump has issued executive orders banning entry to some citizens of several Muslim-majority countries, although courts have partially blocked the measures from taking effect.  Look, I m not talking about the nature of the video,  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.  The threat is real and that s what the president is talking about is the need for national security, the need for military spending, and those are very real things. There s nothing fake about that.  Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of anti-immigration Britain First, posted the videos which she said showed a group of people who were Muslims beating a teenage boy to death, battering a boy on crutches and destroying a Christian statue. Fransen was convicted earlier this month of abusing a Muslim woman and was ordered to pay a fine and legal costs. Some British lawmakers demanded an apology from Trump for sharing the videos with his nearly 44 million Twitter followers and U.S. Muslim groups said he had been incendiary and reckless.  It is wrong for the president to have done this,  the spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said.  Britain First seeks to divide communities through their use of hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people,  the spokesman said. Trump fired back at May over her criticism.  Theresa @theresamay, don t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine,  Trump tweeted, using an incorrect Twitter handle for May. He later issued a tweet with her correct handle,  @Theresa_May .     Reuters was unable to immediately verify the videos and Fransen herself said they had come from various online sources which had been posted on her social media pages.  I m delighted,  Fransen, who has 53,000 Twitter followers, told Reuters. She said Trump s retweets showed the president shared her aim of raising awareness of  issues such as Islam . The White House repeatedly refused to be drawn into the content of the videos or whether Trump was aware of the source of the tweets.  It s about ensuring that individuals who come into the United States don t pose a public safety or terrorism threat,  White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters aboard Air Force One. Fransen thanked Trump and said,  The important message here is Donald Trump has been made aware of the persecution and prosecution of a political leader in Britain for giving what has been said by police to be an anti-Islamic speech.  ANTI-IMMIGRATION One of the videos that Trump retweeted first circulated on social and Egyptian state media in 2013, showing what appeared to be supporters of now-ousted Islamist President Mohammed Mursi throwing two youths from a concrete tower onto a roof. In reference to another video that was titled  Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches! , the Netherlands embassy in the United States tweeted back at Trump saying:  @realDonaldTrump Facts do matter. The perpetrator of the violent act in this video was born and raised in the Netherlands. He received and completed his sentence under Dutch law.  Trump s promotion of the videos contrasts with the way he often criticizes mainstream U.S. media, lambasting some outlets for  fake news  when they air segments he regards as being against him.  What we saw today is one of many videos that is circulating on anti-Muslim hate websites,  said Ilhan Cagri with the U.S.-based Muslim Public Affairs Council.  It is years-old and simply aims to breed fear for Muslims and Islam and breed violence. It  has nothing to do with the practice of Islam itself,  Cagri said. The Anti-Defamation League said the retweets would only encourage  extremists and anti-Muslim bigots in the United States and abroad who exploit the propaganda value.   Such content is the engine that fuels extremist movements and will embolden bigots in the U.S. who already believe the president is a fellow traveler,  the ADL said in a statement. Democrats in Congress and at least one Republican lawmaker were also critical of Trump.   The violence depicted in these videos is horrific, but it is abhorrent that President Trump would choose to deliberately fan the flames of hatred and religious bigotry,  Democratic U.S. Senator Jack Reed said in a statement. Republican Senator John McCain, a frequent critic of Trump, said he was  surprised  that Trump had chosen to retweet those videos.  What do I think about it? Obviously, surprised. Surprised,  he told Reuters as he left a meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah at the U.S. Senate. Britain First is a peripheral political party which wants to end all immigration and bring in a comprehensive ban on Islam, with anyone found to be promoting the religion s ideology to be deported or imprisoned. The group, which rarely garners any media attention but attracts a few hundred protesters to its regular street demonstrations, states on its website it is a  loyalist movement.  Critics say it is simply racist. Last week, Fransen was charged by the police in Northern Ireland with using threatening, abusive or insulting words in a speech at a rally in Belfast in August. Along with the group s leader, she was also charged in September with causing religiously aggravated harassment over the distribution of leaflets and posting online videos during a court trial involving a number of Muslim men accused and later convicted of rape. Politicians in Britain condemned Trump, with Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, describing his tweets as  abhorrent, dangerous and a threat to our society.  In contrast, David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader who has run for political office in Louisiana, praised Trump.  He s condemned for showing us what the fake news media won t,  Duke wrote on Twitter.  Thank God for Trump! That s why we love him!

"November 30, 2017 ","WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed a Chinese diplomatic effort to rein in North Korea s weapons program as a failure on Thursday, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Beijing was doing a lot, but could do more to limit oil supplies to Pyongyang. In a tweet, Trump delivered another insulting barb against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who he called  Little Rocket Man  and a  sick puppy  after North Korea test-fired its most advanced missile to date on Wednesday.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Washington s approach was dangerously provocative.  Trump s tweets further inflamed tensions reignited this week after North Korea said it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile in a  breakthrough  that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons whose warheads could withstand re-entry to the Earth s atmosphere.  The Chinese envoy, who just returned from North Korea, seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man,  Trump said on Twitter, a day after speaking with Chinese President Chinese President Xi Jinping and reiterating his call for Beijing to use its leverage against North Korea. Tillerson on Thursday welcomed Chinese efforts on North Korea, but said Beijing could do more to limit its oil exports to the country.  The Chinese are doing a lot. We do think they could do more with the oil. We re really asking them to please restrain more of the oil, not cut it off completely,  Tillerson said at the State Department. China is North Korea s neighbor and its sole major trading partner. While Trump has been bellicose at times in rhetoric toward North Korea, Tillerson has persistently held out hopes for a return to dialogue if North Korea shows it is willing to give up its nuclear weapons program.  However, Tillerson may not remain in his job long, with disagreements with Trump over North Korea being one factor. On Thursday, senior Trump administration officials said the White House was considering a plan to replace Tillerson with Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he still had confidence in diplomatic efforts on North Korea and that the United States would be  unrelenting  in working through the United Nations. In spite of Trump s rhetoric and warnings that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with North Korea, his administration has stressed it favors a diplomatic solution to the crisis.  Trump has pledged more sanctions in response to the latest  test and, at an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting late Wednesday, the United States warned North Korea s leadership would be  utterly destroyed  if war were to break out.  This administration is focused on one big thing when it comes to North Korea, and that s denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a regular White House briefing.  Anything beyond that is not the priority at this point,  she said, responding to a question on whether regime change was on the administration s agenda after Trump s recent tweets and a speech by U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Lavrov pointed to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises planned for December and accused the United States of trying to provoke Kim into  flying off the handle  over his missile program to hand Washington a pretext to destroy his country.   He also flatly rejected a U.S. call for Russia to cut ties with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile program, calling U.S. policy toward North Korea deeply flawed. In a call with Trump on Thursday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the missile launched this week was North Korea s most advanced so far, but it was unclear whether Pyongyang had the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and it still needed to prove other things, such as its re-entry technology. A White House statement said Trump and Moon reiterated their strong commitment to enhancing the deterrence and defense capabilities of the U.S.-South Korea alliance and added:  Both leaders reaffirmed their strong commitment to compelling North Korea to return to the path of denuclearization at any cost.  North Korea has tested dozens of ballistic missiles under Kim s leadership and conducted its sixth and largest nuclear bomb test in September. It has said its weapons programs are a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, denies any such intention. Previous U.S. administrations have failed to stop North Korea from developing nuclear weapons and a sophisticated missile program. Trump, who has previously said the United States would  totally destroy  North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from the nuclear threat, has also struggled to contain Pyongyang since taking office in January.

"Oct 10, 2016","Another stunning, arrogant slam against Hillary supporters by the Hillary campaign A Clinton campaign email released as part of the Wikileaks data dump earlier today talks about the need to maintain political power by producing  an unaware and compliant citizenry .The email was sent to Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta by former Clinton administration official Bill Ivy on March 13, 2016.Ivy was appointed Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts during Bill Clinton s second term. According to his bio, Ivy  is a trustee of the Center for American Progress (a Clinton campaign front), and was a Team Leader in the Barack Obama presidential transition. In the email, Ivy outlines the panic amongst some Democrats that Donald Trump s  celebrity politics  persona cannot be matched by Hillary, who is  not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold. Money isn t all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we re off and running,  complains Ivy.Ivy wonders how Clinton can combat Trump s larger than life appeal, worrying that simply  defaulting to policy  won t work.  And as I ve mentioned, we ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry,  he writes. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking   and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. To emphasize, Ivy admits that the left has  conspired  to  produce an unaware and compliant citizenry  but that they re not as easy to manipulate anymore and that this is a problem. He characterizes  unawareness  amongst the public as a positive thing for the Clinton campaign.Ivy ends the email by saying he will attend a Clinton fundraiser and that he fears,  we are all now trying to navigate a set of forces that cannot be simply explained or fully understood.

THANK GOODNESS FOR JUDICIAL WATCH!Judicial Watch was informed yesterday by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that the FBI has located 30 pages of documents related to the June 27, 2016, tarmac meeting between former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton, and proposes non-exempt material be produced no later than November 30, 2017 (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:16-cv-02046)).The new documents are being sent to Judicial Watch in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed after the Justice Department failed to comply with a July 7, 2016, FOIA request seeking the following:All FD-302 forms prepared pursuant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation s investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s use of a private e-mail server during her tenure. All records of communications between any agent, employee, or representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding, concerning, or related to the aforementioned investigation. This request includes, but is not limited to, any related communications with any official, employee, or representative of the Department of Justice, the Executive Office of the President, the Democratic National Committee, and/or the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.All records related to the meeting between Attorney General Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016. The FBI originally informed Judicial Watch they did not locate any records related to the tarmac meeting. However, in a related case, the Justice Department located emails in which Justice Department officials communicated with the FBI and wrote that they had communicated with the FBI. As a result, by letter dated August 10, 2017, from the FBI stated,  Upon further review, we subsequently determined potentially responsive documents may exist. As a result, your [FOIA] request has been reopened (Surprisingly, the Trump Justice Department refuses to disclose the talking points developed by the Obama Justice Department to help it respond to press inquiries about the controversial June 27, 2016, tarmac meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.)On June 27, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with former President Bill Clinton on board a parked private plane at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. The meeting occurred during the then-ongoing investigation of Mrs. Clinton s email server, and mere hours before the Benghazi report was released publicly involving both Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration. Judicial Watch filed a request on June 30 that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General investigate that meeting. The FBI is out of control. It is stunning that the FBI  found  these Clinton-Lynch tarmac records only after we caught the agency hiding them in another lawsuit,  stated Judicial Watch Tom Fitton.  Judicial Watch will continue to press for answers about the FBI s document games in court. In the meantime, the FBI should stop the stonewall and release these new records immediately. This case has also forced the FBI to release to the public the FBI s Clinton investigative file, although more than half of the records remain withheld. The FBI has also told Judicial Watch that it anticipates completing the processing of these materials by July 2018.There is significant controversy about whether the FBI and Obama Justice Department investigation gave Clinton and other witnesses and potential targets preferential treatment.The Obama administration extended numerous immunity agreements, including: Clinton s former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills; John Bentel, former director of the State Department s Office of Information Resources Management; Heather Samuelson, Clinton s executive assistant; Brian Pagliano, an IT employee at the State Department who serviced the Clinton non-government server; and an employee at Platt River Networks, the company that maintained it. It is not clear whether Hillary Clinton received some type of immunity.In 2015, a political action committee run by McAuliffe, a close friend and political supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, donated nearly $500,000 to Jill McCabe, wife of McCabe, who was then running for the Virginia State Senate. Also, the Virginia Democratic Party, over which McAuliffe had significant influence, donated an additional $207,788 to the Jill McCabe campaign. In July 2015, Andrew McCabe was in charge of the FBI s Washington, DC, field office, which provided personnel resources to the Clinton email probe.

When will Republicans stop cowering to threats of  racism  and voter suppressions levied by the very people who are stealing our votes?There s a mere four weeks left to go before the presidential election, and the allegations of voter fraud just. Keep. Coming.The Kankakee Daily Journal, a local newspaper in a county just south of Chicago, reported last week that several citizens in the small county reported they were offered bribes in return for casting votes for Democrats. Voting officials were also looking into reports that some mail-in voter applications had been filed from outside the county.From the article:The Kankakee County State s Attorney s office says it is investigating possible voting fraud after the clerk s office reported three complaints from people who said they were offered bribes for votes.In a news release issued late Tuesday afternoon, Jamie Boyd, the state s attorney, also said  several  vote-by-mail applications seem to have come from people living outside of Kankakee County. This unprecedented action was taken in response to reports of individuals from Chicago offering gifts to potential voters in exchange for a vote for Kate Cloonen, Hillary Clinton and others,  Boyd said in the news release.  Our office takes seriously the obligation to protect the rights of citizens to vote for the candidate of their choice, and to do so without undue influence from special interest groups. The investigation will also focus on the authenticity of vote by mail requests. Several applications have been filed with the election authority that appear to be fraudulently executed. The report closely followed allegations of voter fraud in Virginia, where at least 20 dead people were illegally registered to vote by a James Madison student working for a local voter registration group called HarrisonburgVOTES. The Washington Free Beacon reported the group is run by one Joe Fitzgerald, the chairman of his local Democratic Committee, and that the student, Andrew Spieles, is also a registered Democrat.Additionally, the Virginia Voters Alliance and the Public Interest Legal Foundation found that at least 1,046 non-U.S. citizens across eight districts had voted in the 2012 presidential election.

"Oct 16, 2015","The corrupt covering for the corrupt. Chicago politics at its best Hillary Clinton could be prosecuted in federal court for failing to tell President Barack Obama about her private email server at the time she was running it, according to a veteran FBI agent. Obama said flatly during a  60 Minutes  interview on Sunday that  No,  he did not know Clinton sidestepped security protocols with her a home-brew email setup while she was his secretary of state.The FBI agent who spoke with DailyMail.com has had a 20-year career in federal law enforcement and serves in a supervisory capacity in a domestic FBI field office.He said on Friday that failing to put Obama in the loop could be enough to send her to prison for ten years. Via:Daily MailEver since he opined that the police had  acted stupidly  prior to the infamous and embarrassing  beer summit , Obama has shown himself eager to interfere with ongoing investigations for political reasons. When thuglet Trayvon Martin provided an good example of why jumping and beating down a stranger is a bad evolutionary strategy, Obama jumped on the race-baiting bandwagon saying if he had a son, that son would look like Martin. When the Justice Department was looking into the illegal use of the IRS to harass opponents of the administration, Obama said  there is not even a smidgen of corruption.  When deserter and failed turncoat Bowe Bergdahl was released by the Taliban, Obama had his hippie parents over for a Rose Garden ceremony even though he was known at the time to be a deserter. Now Obama has interjected himself into the investigation into the fate of top secret documents illegally stored on Hillary Clinton s private server. From his 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft on October 11:Steve Kroft: Do you think it posed a national security problem?President Barack Obama: I don t think it posed a national security problem. I think that it was a mistake that she has acknowledged and  you know, as a general proposition, when we re in these offices, we have to be more sensitive and stay as far away from the line as possible when it comes to how we handle information, how we handle our own personal data. And, you know, she made a mistake. She has acknowledged it. I do think that the way it s been ginned-up is in part because of  in part  because of politics. And I think she d be the first to acknowledge that maybe she could have handled the original decision better and the disclosures more quickly. But Steve Kroft: What was your reaction when you found out about it?President Barack Obama: This is one of those issues that I think is legitimate, but the fact that for the last three months this is all that s been spoken about is an indication that we re in presidential political season.Steve Kroft: Do you agree with what President Clinton has said and Secretary Clinton has said, that this is not  not that big a deal. Do you agree with that?President Barack Obama: Well, I m not going to comment on Steve Kroft: You think it s not that big a deal President Barack Obama: What I think is that it is important for her to answer these questions to the satisfaction of the American public. And they can make their own judgment. I can tell you that this is not a situation in which America s national security was endangered.Steve Kroft: This administration has prosecuted people for having classified material on their private computers.President Barack Obama: Well, I  there s no doubt that there had been breaches, and these are all a matter of degree. We don t get an impression that here there was purposely efforts  on  in  to hide something or to squirrel away information. But again, I m gonna leave it to This can only be seen as an attempt by Obama to tell the federal prosecutors who will ultimately decide what, if any, charges should be made in this case that there is nothing to see here:Those statements angered F.B.I. agents who have been working for months to determine whether Ms. Clinton s email setup had in fact put any of the nation s secrets at risk, according to current and former law enforcement officials.Investigators have not reached any conclusions about whether the information on the server had been compromised or whether to recommend charges, according to the law enforcement officials. But to investigators, it sounded as if Mr. Obama had already decided the answers to their questions and cleared anyone involved of wrongdoing.The White House quickly backed off the president s remarks and said Mr. Obama was not trying to influence the investigation. But his comments spread quickly, raising the ire of officials who saw an instance of the president trying to influence the outcome of a continuing investigation   and not for the first time.A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment. But Ron Hosko, a former senior F.B.I. official who retired in 2014 and is now the president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, said it was inappropriate for the president to  suggest what side of the investigation he is on  when the F.B.I. is still investigating. Injecting politics into what is supposed to be a fact-finding inquiry leaves a foul taste in the F.B.I. s mouth and makes them fear that no matter what they find, the Justice Department will take the president s signal and not bring a case,  said Mr. Hosko, who maintains close contact with current agents.Several current and former law enforcement officials, including those close to the investigation, expressed similar sentiments in separate interviews over several days. Most, however, did so only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case.Contrary to what Hillary s campaign is saying, we now have it on pretty good authority that the FBI is conducting an investigation under the part of the Espionage Act that pertains to gross negligence in the handling of Defense information. That information, at a minimum, is the two Top Secret Keyhole satellite derived documents discovered by the Intelligence Community IG though it could be any of the over 400 emails containing classified information that have been uncovered so far.(f) Whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information, relating to the national defense, (1) through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer  Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.

He ripped the Clintons and called on Trump s intelligence and law officials to investigate the scandal. It s a classic Hannity rant:  After President Trump won in November, President Obama and his administration   they were telling anyone who would listen,  Russia! Russia! Russia! Russia interfered with our election. Russia was creating a direct threat to American democracy  Hannity mocked.  Well if that s the case, why when they have mountains of evidence that we will reveal tonight of Russian bribery going back to 2009, why then would the Obama administration and Hillary in particular sign off on the sale of 20% of America s uranium to Vladimir Putin and the Russians? Tonight, with this new evidence, what we have discovered is that the evidence against the Clintons is overwhelming, it is incontrovertible,  Hannity continued.  Hillary Clinton and her husband sold out America to the Russians while millions of dollars flowed to their family foundation. And in the process, Clinton created a massive national security risk for every man, woman, and child   giving Vladimir Putin control over American uranium. IN CASE YOU HAVEN T HEARD ABOUT THE LATEST ON THE CLINTON-URANIUM ONE BOMBSHELL:Yesterday, the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange sent a cryptic tweet that contained a series of number and letters.

Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged. I had no idea this case was being conducted,  a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Meanwhile, Julian Assange is jumping on the bandwagon, as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon Russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that Russia routed millions to the Clintons https://t.co/ti7ycn7auf  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 17, 2017",HANNITY TEARS IT UP IN HIS BEST EVER RANT: ‘Hillary Clinton and Her Husband Sold Out America to the Russians!’ [Video]

"Oct 19, 2016","Dear Barack Obama, please don t tell me voter fraud isn t possible in a state where the Governor and Secretary of State are Republicans. I live in the very blue state of Michigan where both offices are held by Republicans and I beg to differ I was a poll challenger in the city of Pontiac, MI in 2012 and again, in 2014. The video below is an interview I did with Dennis Michael Lynch where I discuss the unbelievable corrupt behavior by the poll supervisor and voter fraud I witnessed. Dennis starts out the video by discussing Republican Governor Rick Snyder.  Although I am no fan of the Governor s I m not sure he ever knew about the decision by the GOP to ignore the voter fraud we witnessed. But Republican Secretary of State Ruth Johnson s office was fully aware of the voter fraud we witnessed and chose to look away.My best friend and business partner Leisa and I asked  to go to Detroit in 2012 to work as poll challengers. We were given the assignment, left early in the morning and headed into what we were sure was going to be a contentious day. We couldn t have been more wrong. The women who were supervising the polling places were serious and followed the rules to a tee. Besides the fact that every voter coming into the polling place had what is called a  Black Slate  (that s essentially a mock up of the ballot with the spots marked where voters were expected to fill in) we couldn t find a single irregularity or rule that wasn t being followed. The  Black Slate  was a sort of cheat sheet for uniformed voters. There were no decisions that had to be made by the voter, just fill in the ovals exactly as they appeared on the  Black Slate   and voil you ve voted! No need to pick candidates, judges or even to make decisions on ballot proposals, they ve already been made for you by whomever decided how black Michigan residents should vote. We were pleased to see that there weren t any issues at the Detroit polling place, so we decided to move to Pontiac where a friend had been messaging us about some  strange things  that were happening. She had never been a poll challenger before, but was wondering if people should have been putting their own ballots in the machine in the early morning hours just after the opening of the polls.Upon entering the polling place, we were greeting by a supervisor. She was a black woman with a very stern look on her face. We smiled, handed her a box of donuts, introduced ourselves and said we were working for the Republican Party as poll challengers. Her response was,  I ll be watching you watching me.  That was just the start of what turned out to be a very contentious day at the polls.I spent the day with my good friend Dennis Michael Lynch driving around Detroit and talking to people about jobs and other issues. While we were driving, Dennis asked me to tell him my story. Although it s not my most flattering angle LOL here is my story:There were 3 precincts within one building where we landed in Pontiac. The black female supervisor at the precinct where I was working was getting very frustrated by presence at the polls. It was pretty clear they were not conditioned to having anyone watch the voting process, as the workers and supervisors all appeared to be on edge. As voters came through they were asked to show identification in order to get their registration form. After they received their white voter registration form, they moved down the line for the next person who had a voter roll book with the names and addresses of the voters. The person with the book was supposed to check the picture ID against the name on the form and the name in the book. The person with the book appeared to be intentionally blocking me out so I couldn t see the book. I tried to lean around him and the supervisor yelled at me to  get back!  She kept saying,  You re making him uncomfortable!  I continued to move around until I could find a spot within the boundaries I was allowed to stand in, so I could be sure the voters names were matching those in the voter roll book. Every time I would start to get a closer look, he would slam the book shut and either say, their names were in the book, or that they weren t, in which case, he would pull out his flip phone and dial a number. He claimed he was calling the City Clerk and after giving the voters name, he would say the Clerk said  it was okay for them to vote . I would challenge the vote, as I couldn t see the book or the voters name on their ID, the supervisor would ignore me. Over and over again, I said I wanted to challenge the vote, and she ignored me. At one point things became so heated that she pressed her chest up against mine and was physically threatening me to back away from the process. I refused, and  the voters in the line began to cheer for her, like we were in some sort of cage match.After several SOS phone calls to the MI Republican Party hotline, they finally sent an attorney who witnessed the supervisor ignoring me when I asked for her to challenge the vote. Leisa, the attorney who was working for the GOP or Mitt Romney (we never got a straight answer about who he was working for from the GOP) and I took notes, we were all stunned at what we witnessed.I waited a few days after Mitt Romney s devastating defeat hoping I would hear from someone in the Republican Party. I never did. Several days later, I took it upon myself to call the MI GOP Party Chairman, who at the time was Bobby Schostak. I relayed part of my story to him, he didn t seem to be very interested and told me to call our Republican Secretary of State Ruth Johnson. I called her office and explained why I was calling. I never heard back. I called the person who scheduled us at the polling place and asked if the attorney was going to move forward with charges. He told us if the GOP was going to do anything, they would likely contact me. We never heard back from anyone.Two years later we returned to the same polling place and again witnessed more shenanigans. This time they were ready for us. Large men appeared out of nowhere and lined up against the wall directly across from where I was standing. They were watching me. On several occasions, one of them would come up and ask me why I was there. I explained I was only protecting the sanctity of the vote and it wasn t a Republican or Democrat thing. Protecting the sanctity of our vote was for the good of every American. He sneered and walked away. When things became heated between a poll worker and me because she kept insisting I was  making her uncomfortable,  I called and begged for the Republican Party to send a representative to help us out. When they finally sent someone, the City Clerk approached us and told me he had to leave. I explained that he could be there, so she called a Sheriff to come down and deal with me. Together, they threatened to have me arrested if I continued to break the rules. I explained I wasn t breaking any rules and reminded the Sheriff that if he was going to threaten me, he should understand the law. Ten minutes later, the City Clerk approached me and told me she was  sorry  that it appeared I hadn t broken any laws. As it turns out, she was only using the Sheriff as a prop. She wanted to create a news story. She wanted to say they had to call in a law enforcement officer to prevent me from intimidating the voters. When we left for lunch she called the press. The story was printed with no opposition to their lies and we were never contacted to give our side. The GOP party told us to leave after lunch. They said the press was there and they didn t want us to talk to them. We reluctantly left.After our second time at the same polls and not seeing any real improvement, I decided I needed to demand someone from the Secretary of State s office speak to me. I called Ruth Johnson s office and I was directed to her assistant, Linda Lee-Tarver (who for the record is a lovely woman and I do believe she was genuinely concerned about our situation). I spent over an hour on the phone with Linda Lee -Tarver explaining in great detail all that took place on that day. She said she was stunned, and that I should tell everything to Secretary of State Ruth Johnson s Chief of Staff Mike Seneyko. I then spoke with Mike on the phone for over an hour. He promised they would do something. I never heard back from him. To this day, I have yet to hear back from a single GOP official. Apparently, two mothers who risked their safety and possibly our lives to protect the sanctity of the vote was not important enough to them.Will we be poll challenger again? You betcha. Just knowing that we possibly slowed the bleed a bit makes me feel like it was all worth it. Do I trust the GOP to take voter fraud by Democrats seriously? Hell no ",THE DAY I WATCHED OUR VOTES BEING STOLEN…As The Republican Party I Risked My Life For Stood By And Did Nothing [VIDEO]

"Oct 21, 2015","CNN Anchor Carol Costello acts like she s never heard about the lying that came from Hillary Clinton when Clinton told Patricia Smith that she d get to the bottom of what happened to Mrs. Smith s son in Benghazi. Was Ms. Costello unaware or was she playing dumb? We ll probably never know but the press has been covering for the Obama administration on Benghazi since day one. The cover-up is real and it s happening from the press on up to the White House. The bottom line is that Mrs. Smith is correct and screaming it from the rooftops as any mom would for their child. It s so shameful and sad that once again politics comes before doing the right thing with Obama and Clinton.

They told you that?  an obviously surprised Costello asked.As alarming at Smith s claims were, however, she really let her feelings be known when Costello played a clip from Clinton s testimony in January 2013. At the time, Clinton said that it was their job  to figure out what happened and do everything [they could] to prevent it from happening again. Smith s response?  She s lying! She s absolutely lying!

"Oct 22, 2015","How long before US courts are asked to not bother trying cases where illegal aliens are involved, so as not to give the impression of being unfair When Francisco Javier Chavez posted bail on charges of beating a California toddler within an inch of her life in late July, there was little reason to expect the illegal immigrant, who has spent much of his adult life hopping back and forth across the Mexican border, would return to face justice.Two weeks later, at his scheduled arraignment on Aug. 13, Chavez was a no-show. The 27-year-old career criminal had put up $10,000, or 10 percent of the amount set for his alleged crimes by California s bail schedule. His disappearance is hardly a surprise to critics who believe violent illegal immigrants are, by definition, flight risks who should be denied bail in such serious cases. They say judges, especially in border states plagued by illegal immigrant crime, are naive or worse if they expect suspects who regularly cross in and out of Mexico to take the U.S. justice system seriously. Frankly, judges grant bail in cases like these because they are being foolish,  said Hans A. von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department lawyer now at The Heritage Foundation s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies.  The judge can consider bail for you when you are charged with a crime, but does not have to let you out on bail. If the state can show you are a flight risk, you should not get bail. If the state can show you are a danger to the public because of a history of violence, you should not get bail. Frankly, judges grant bail in cases like these because they are being foolish. While Chavez is in the wind, his alleged victim, the 2-year-old daughter of his live-in girlfriend, is now in foster care, paralyzed from the beating that also left her with both arms and a femur broken.Well before he was arrested in San Luis Obispo County for attacking the child, Chavez had compiled a lengthy criminal record that includes assault and drug convictions and arrests for violent acts such as kidnapping, car-jacking and cruelty to a child. He was deported in February 2014, but as in previous instances, found it easy to sneak back across the border and into the U.S. Francisco Javier Chavez, (l.), posted bail and has not been seen again after allegedly beating a toddler. Jose Enrique Vasquez, (r.), was accused of killing a child, but could be freed if he posts bail.Weeks after Chavez slipped out of custody, on Sept. 1, another 2-year-old toddler named Jonathan Montez was run down and killed in San Bernardino County. Illegal immigrant Jose Enrique Vasquez, 53, an unlicensed driver who witnesses said was speeding down the child s residential street, fled the scene, according to authorities. He was arrested two weeks later, and, like Chavez, was granted bail.Vasquez also has compiled a lengthy criminal record under various aliases, including charges of spousal abuse, battery of a peace officer, driving without a license, driving under the influence and armed robbery. But other charges in his criminal record might have given a judge pause in considering bail according to critics, including failure to appear in court, possession of false citizenship documents and eight deportations for illegally entering the country.The systems for granting bail in state courts varies from state to state. California s bail system lays out prescribed amounts for various crimes as a guideline for law enforcement and judges, but judges retain discretion to raise the amount in cases where the suspect is a flight risk or a danger to the public and the district attorney can add, drop or change the charges. Two states, Alabama and Missouri, have passed laws that preclude bail for illegal immigrants suspected of serious crimes, while judges in other states   notably Texas   weigh illegal status in making their decisions. But last year, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Arizona s 2006 law banning bail for illegal immigrant suspects violated their right to due process and amounted to punishment before trial. The 11-member panel s decision called the law a  scattered attempt  to deal with the problem of chronic bail-skipping by illegal immigrants. Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider the lower court s decision.Judges everywhere maintain discretion to deny bail to anyone they believe is likely to flee justice, yet they often fail to consider illegal status as a factor, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies. And critics say it should be obvious that someone here illegally and suspected of a violent crime will bolt rather than face justice, especially in border states such as California, where they can be out of the country an hour after posting bail. Aliens who commit acts of violence should not be released on bail, because they are clearly a danger to the public, and when we have someone with this kind of deportation history, clearly they are an obvious flight risk,  said von Spakovsky.  These judges are making mistakes granting bail to illegal aliens   reckless mistakes that endangered the public. The willingness of judges to grant bail to illegal immigrants charged with serious crimes compounds the ongoing controversy involving so-called sanctuary cities. Such jurisdictions, either by local statute or practice, refuse to inform federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents when an illegal immigrant is detained.But even jurisdictions that do not implement sanctuary policies believe that two federal court rulings, the 2013 California  Trust Act,  which limits  cruel and costly immigration hold requests in local jails,  and an ambiguous White House policy all bar them from holding illegal immigrants who have posted bail until federal authorities can collect and deport them   even if ICE asks them to via what is known as a  detainer request. The American Civil Liberties Union has sued jurisdictions that attempted to honor the ICE detainers, and the Department of Justice has not intervened in the cases to underscore its support of them. As a result, local law enforcement agencies say they have no choice but to let even violent illegal immigrant suspects walk once they are granted bail.

"Oct 22, 2017","There s so much to know in order to understand just how bad the Uranium One scandal is to what s happening now with the Fake Russia probe by Comey. Once you understand the connections and the details of it, you realize it s HUGE!It s not just the Clinton grifters but Obama, the FBI and the DOJ!And at the heart of it is not just the greedy, grasping Clintons, but the Obama Administration, the FBI and the DOJ.Andrew McCarthy does a masterful job of breaking down the entire scandal from beginning until now.McCarthy breaks it all down for you.You ll be shocked to know that the same people investigating the phony Trump/Russia  collusion  were aware of the Uranium One scam AND even helped to cover it up! Here s just a little of what Andy McCarthy explains to us in his summary:Here s the kicker: The Uranium One scandal is not only, or even principally, a Clinton scandal. It is an Obama-administration scandal.The Clintons were just doing what the Clintons do: cashing in on their  public service.  The Obama administration, with Secretary Clinton at the forefront but hardly alone, was knowingly compromising American national-security interests. The administration green-lighted the transfer of control over one-fifth of American uranium-mining capacity to Russia, a hostile regime   and specifically to Russia s state-controlled nuclear-energy conglomerate, Rosatom. Worse, at the time the administration approved the transfer, it knew that Rosatom s American subsidiary was engaged in a lucrative racketeering enterprise that had already committed felony extortion, fraud, and money-laundering offenses.This next part is even worse:The Obama administration also knew that congressional Republicans were trying to stop the transfer. Consequently, the Justice Department concealed what it knew. DOJ allowed the racketeering enterprise to continue compromising the American uranium industry rather than commencing a prosecution that would have scotched the transfer. Prosecutors waited four years before quietly pleading the case out for a song, in violation of Justice Department charging guidelines. Meanwhile, the administration stonewalled Congress, reportedly threatening an informant who wanted to go public.Read more here: Andy McCarthyOnce you read the entire summary you ll know just how bad this entire scandal is and how the Obama administration covered it all up.

"Oct 23, 2016","How much more criminal activity are American voters willing to overlook? Have we, as Americans gotten to the point that no crime committed by Hillary or anyone attached to Hillary will disqualify her from being elected to the highest office in our nation? Are we willing to accept that we can no longer trust anyone working for a government organization in America? The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton s email use.Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI.The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.Mr. McAuliffe and other state party leaders recruited Dr. McCabe to run, according to party officials. She lost the election to incumbent Republican Dick Black.A spokesman for the governor said he  supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors  Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous. Among political candidates that year, Dr. McCabe was the third-largest recipient of funds from Common Good VA, the governor s PAC, according to campaign finance records. Dan Gecker received $781,500 from the PAC and $214,456 from the state party for a campaign that raised $2.9 million, according to records; and Jeremy McPike received $803,500 from the PAC and $535,162 from the state party, raising more $3.8 million that year for his candidacy.The governor could recall only one meeting with Mr. McCabe when he and other state Democrats met with the couple on March 7, 2015, to urge Dr. McCabe to run, according to the spokesman.The FBI said in a statement that during his wife s campaign Mr. McCabe  played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind. Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton s emails. FBI officials said that after that meeting with the governor in Richmond on March 7, Mr. McCabe sought ethics advice from the bureau and followed it, avoiding involvement with public corruption cases in Virginia, and avoiding any campaign activity or events.Mr. McCabe s supervision of the Clinton email case in 2016 wasn t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife s campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn t part of the email probe, officials said. Once I decided to run,  Dr. McCabe said,  my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be a supportive husband to me and our children. As a federal official everyone who participated in our campaign understood and respected that he could not participate. Mr. McCabe is a longtime FBI official who focused much of his career on terrorism. His wife is a hospital physician who campaigned in northern Virginia, where the couple live with their children.The 2015 Virginia State senate race was Dr. McCabe s first run for office and her campaign spent $1.8 million. The race was part of Mr. McAuliffe s failed effort to win a Democratic majority in the Virginia legislature, which would have given him significantly more sway in Richmond, the state capital.Mr. McAuliffe has been a central figure in the Clintons  political careers for decades. In the 1990s, he was Bill Clinton s chief fundraiser and he remains one of the couple s closest allies and public boosters. Mrs. Clinton appeared with him in northern Virginia in 2015 as he sought to increase the number of Democrats in the state legislature.

"Oct 23, 2017","Oh the irony! Left-leaning MSNBC aired a segment about President Trump s proposed border wall, which ultimately proved the U.S.-Mexico border needs a bigger wall.HOW HIGH SHOULD WE GO? The Trump administration has approved the construction of eight prototypes of the border wall. These prototypes are nearing completion as the administration s deadline approaches. The prototypes have several guidelines they must satisfy. For instance, concrete walls have to be 30 ft. tall while walls made from alternate materials have to be 18 to 30 ft. tall.JUMPING THE FENCE MSNBC reporter Jacob Soboroff went to preview the prototypes that are being built between two existing border fences along the U.S.-Mexico border. During the segment, Soboroff was interviewing border patrol agent Roy Villareal when several migrants were caught on camera jumping the existing fence into the United States.EVERYDAY BORDER ENFORCEMENT = OPEN BORDERS  A small group of three people just jumped over in the middle of the day,  Soboroff noted.  So can you explain to me what s going on? This is the reality of everyday border enforcement. The United States is the draw for people with dire situations where they are at,  Villareal said.  We are going to continue to witness this. It plays out on a regular basis for us. Soboroff went to the Mexican side of the border and showed how easy it was to cross the border under current conditions.THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! Can you imagine how easy it s been for terrorists to cross?We just reported on a terrorist who made his way to Canada via Mexico and the U.S.: The Democrats are fighting against closing our border with Mexico at every step of the way. They want open borders It s that simple. If you vote for Democrats then you re voting for open borders. They have zero interest in stopping the flow of illegals to America. One of the key things to remember about open borders is it s not just the people from Mexico looking for a job or better life. The truth is that our open border has become a GLOBAL MAGNET for people from all over the world to come for many different reasons. One of the reasons is terrorism The case below highlights the desperate need for border control if we want to stop the flow of terrorists to America and Canada:The Somali terrorist who stabbed a Canadian police officer and ran over four pedestrians a few weeks ago entered the United States through the Mexican border and was released by Obama s Department of Homeland Security (DHS), allowing him to continue his journey north. The ISIS operative, Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, was ordered deported, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman told various media outlets recently, but was released on an  order of supervision  and the feds never saw him again.Sharif entered the U.S. in 2011 through the San Ysidro port of entry in California without documentation and was briefly held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, a local newspaper reported. A year later he crossed the border into Canada and settled in Edmonton after being granted refugee status. On September 30 he slammed into an Edmonton police officer with his car then got out of the vehicle and repeatedly stabbed the cop with a knife. After fleeing the scene, Sharif stole a truck and deliberately mowed down four pedestrians. Canadian authorities found an ISIS flag in his car and have charged him with multiple counts of attempted murder, criminal flight causing bodily harm and possession of a weapon. Two years ago, Canadian authorities investigated the 30-year-old terrorist for espousing extremist views. It s disturbing that Sharif s northbound trek took him through the U.S.-Mexico border.As part of an ongoing investigation into cartels, corruption and terrorism, Judicial Watch has for years reported that Islamic extremists are entering the country through Mexico and that ISIS is operating in border towns just miles from American cities. Judicial Watch launched the project in 2014 by exposing a sophisticated narco-terror ring with strong ties to ISIS and connections running from El Paso to Chicago to New York City. Two of the FBI s most wanted were embroiled in the operation that also had deep ties to Mexico. Less than a year later, Judicial Watch reported that ISIS is operating in a Mexican border town just eight miles from El Paso, the result of Islamic terrorists joining forces with drug cartels and human smugglers knowns as  coyotes. When Judicial Watch reported that Mexican cartels were smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into a small Texas rural town, federal authorities publicly denied the story was true. Never the less, high-level sources on both sides of the border confirmed to Judicial Watch that foreigners, classified as Special Interest Aliens (SIA), were being transported to stash areas in Acala, a rural crossroads located around 54 miles from El Paso on a state road   Highway 20. Once in the U.S., the SIAs waited for pick-up in the area s sand hills just across Highway 20. At the time a Texas Department of Public Safety report leaked by the media had already confirmed that for years members of known Islamist terrorist organizations had been apprehended crossing the southern border.Last year a high-ranking DHS official told Judicial Watch that Mexican drug traffickers help Islamic terrorists stationed in Mexico cross into the United States to explore targets for future attacks. Among the jihadists that travel back and forth through the porous southern border is a Kuwaiti named Shaykh Mahmood Omar Khabir, an ISIS operative who lives in the Mexican state of Chihuahua not far from El Paso. Khabir trained hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen and has lived in Mexico for more than a year, according to information provided by Judicial Watch s government source. Now Khabir trains thousands of men mostly Syrians and Yemenis to fight in an ISIS base situated in the Mexico-U.S. border region near Ciudad Ju rez, the intelligence gathered by Judicial Watch s source reveals. Staking out U.S. targets is not difficult and Khabir actually bragged in an Italian newspaper article that the border region is so open that he  could get in with a handful of men, and kill thousands of people in Texas or in Arizona in the space of a few hours.  In the same article Mexico s top diplomat, Foreign Affairs Secretary Claudia Ruiz, said  this new wave of fundamentalism could have nasty surprises in store for the United States. While much of the American mainstream media ignores that Sharif made it to Canada via the U.S.-Mexico border, it s hardly surprising considering Islamic extremists have been infiltrating the country through the famously unprotected region for years. Referring to the recent Canadian attack, a think-tank dedicated to investigating the operations, funding, activities and front groups of Islamic extremists worldwide writes:  Fears about a terrorist using the U.S.-Mexican border as a gateway for an attack have been realized.

"Oct 24, 2015","Of course he s a  racist  for defending legal American citizens Unlike Obama, Trump s not looking to make friends with illegal aliens. Legal American citizens will reward his dedication to defending our borders with their votes Donald Trump, business mogul and current Republican front-runner, has reiterated his stand on the issue of illegal immigration, saying that he would deport up to 11 million illegals and then build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.Trump has taken plenty of heat from Democrats and his Republican challengers, some of whom tried to get him to back down from his non-politically correct views. The Donald will have none of it.In nearly every recent public appearance, and in the second Republican debates on Sept. 16, Trump noted that the number of illegals is likely much higher than 11 million, and that he would deport the lot of them forthwith.Specifically, Mr. Trump said he could facilitate the mass deportation and rid the U.S. of nearly all illegal immigrants within two years, and possibly as fast as 18 months. Saying  We have to get them out,  and  We are a nation of laws,  Trump employed his typically colorful language when he concluded that he would deport the illegals so quickly,  Your head will spin. Trump s 2-year plan would deport, on average, 15,068.4 illegal immigrants per day in order to reach the 11 million mark successfully.Until now, one of the starting points in most debates about illegal immigration, especially among moderate Republicans and Democrats, has been the notion that there are so many undocumented immigrants in the U.S., it would be impossible to deport them all.Trump proposes a fast deportation plan followed by the building of a massive border wall to keep future illegal crossers from coming over. Further, the candidate s proposal includes a provision whereby those who are deported can apply to re-enter the U.S., but they must follow the formal, legal procedures already in place.The formal entry process is lengthy, involves a significant amount of paperwork, and is intended to keep criminals and unsavory characters (like potential terrorists) out of the country. In fact, most developed nations have more stringent immigration policies than the U.S. does. Mexico, for example, is quite strict about its own southern border, where many Central American immigrants attempt to sneak into the country without proper documentation. Typically those illegal entrants are caught, jailed, and then quickly deported.Trump s views are not lost on African Americans, many of whom responded to a recent SurveyUSA poll about their preferences in the upcoming general election. One-fourth of the respondents said they would choose Trump over Hillary Clinton if that were the matchup in November 2016. In most national elections, blacks vote for the Democrat candidate about nine-to-one over the Republican. Many blacks see illegal immigration as one of the reasons for the exceedingly high unemployment rate in their communities.

"Oct 24, 2016","Those who were  shocked  by the latest ABC / Washington Post goal seeking report (aka  poll ) that shows Hillary opening up a 12-point lead with likely voters after the latest debate last Wednesday need to look a little further. Ironically, this  poll  farce was  embargoed for release after 9 a.m.  EST on Saturday, which made it a dominant topic of conversation on all the morning talk shows.Of course, like many of the recent polls from the likes of Reuters, ABC and The Washington Post, something curious emerges when you look just beneath the surface of the headline 12-point lead.Meanwhile, with huge variances in preference across demographics one can easily see how simple it is to  rig  a poll by over indexing to one group vs. another. While the pollsters release the the split of the sample pool by political affiliation, they do not share the split by any of the following demographics which are just as important to determining the outcome of the poll.  Zero Hedge METHODOLOGY   This ABC News poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Oct. 20-22, 2016, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 874 likely voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 36-27-31 percent, Democrats   Republicans   Independents. As we ve pointed out numerous times in the past, in response to Reuters  efforts to  tweak  their polls, per the The Pew Research Center, at least since 1992, democrats have never enjoyed a 9-point registration gap despite the folks at ABC and The Washington Post somehow convincing themselves it was a reasonable margin.Rush Limbaugh weighed in on the suspicious outlier poll that came out on Saturday night: I don t care what network you watch, maybe with Fox exempted, although certain places at Fox you ll find the same sentiment. It s over. And they all cite these polls. They all cite the polls that show Hillary up 10 to 12 points. And even take the low point at 10, I just saw somebody on CNN, a conservative Republican say,  At 10 points with two weeks it s over, there s no way you can reverse that, it s history. So they all believe the polls. In fact, their belief in the polls is biblical. I think these people have a greater confidence and faith in the polls than they do in the Bible. So it s over. And, furthermore, to show you just how over it is, the Democrats are actually now in red states where Trump may win those states, but they re in there and they re working down the ballot and they re gonna win back the House, they re gonna win back the Senate, and Chuck-U Schumer is gonna end up a majority leader in the Senate.And you Republicans, you are toast, do you understand? You Republicans, it s toast, and you Republicans had better start doing your postmortems right now, and you had better starting figuring out why this happened. You lost this because you saw to it that Trump was nominated, and if you weren t for Trump, you better find out who made it possible for Trump to be nominated, and you better do something about those people. Americans who are sick and tired of a corrupt media and the corrupt politicians they prop up, need to ignore these manufactured polls. Instead of wasting time reading this drivel, Americans need to be out knocking on doors and contacting friends, to explain to them why we need a President like Trump to DRAIN THE SWAMP!There has never been a better time to ignore Hillary s media and stay focused on the prize ",BUSTED!

"Oct 26, 2015","He s always been in our top three. A rock solid conservative who s not afraid to fight back against the establishment on behalf of his constituents. A politician with a spine who respects our Constitution. You really can t ask for much more at this critical time in our nation RUSH: I think that there is a dark horse in this entire thing. I think there is one candidate who is positioned here. Now, I know it s getting late. Trump has had the lead for a hundred days here or more. Well, he s been in the lead ever since he got in. And there are now fewer days to Iowa than he has been in the lead. I mean, he s over the hump in that regard. But there s still a long way to go. It s politics. Any number of unforeseen, unpredictable events are potentially out there, and there has been somebody trucking along here, steady Eddie that has continued to be who he is and continues to lay down foundational markers for himself, and that s Ted Cruz. I think Ted Cruz is positioned, I wouldn t say ideally, I mean I m sure Cruz would love to be in the top two, top three here, but of all the others in the race, Trump and Carson here, and they re at number one and two, Carson s pulled ahead of Trump even in Iowa now, in two polls. But overall Trump leads and his lead continues to expand.But what if it doesn t? What if something happens? We re not shut out here. We still have somebody in our roster who opposes every bit of the Democrat agenda, perhaps more than anybody else in the race, and that s Cruz. I mean, Cruz does not have in his record any statement like Trump does of having supported certain things the Democrats have done. Cruz is inarguably thoroughbred conservative. The more I read about the Millennials, by the way, and I ve got some stuff about them in the Stack today, the more I read about Millennials and where they are attitudinally, politically, socially, economically, Cruz is somebody I think has a great opportunity to connect with them.In fact, before we get to the Trump sound bites, let me find this little thing on the Millennials.  Survey: Millennials Around the World Worry Most About Economic Inequality.  Now, this is typical of young people, young generations. They see injustice and unfairness and inequality out there and they want to right it, they want to correct it. When you have half of the country making   this is unbelievable   51% percent of the country making under $30,000 a year, that just cannot stand. We will not have a standard economy with that kind of reality. We just won t.The website here is USA Today, and the survey comes from the World Economic Forum, and they released it yesterday.  Millennials around the world worry most about social and economic equality, remain skeptical of government and the media, and count Tesla CEO Elon Musk as one their heroes, according to a World Economic Forum survey released Sunday. More than 1,000 young people, ages 20 to 30, from 125 countries and who are all active in the forum s Global Shapers Community. It s a left wing bunch, the World Economic Forum, it s an establishment left-wing bunch, understand, but they still went out and they talked to these Millennials all over the world, 125 different countries.  The average age was 28. The results were released at the beginning of a three-day World Economic Forum conference in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates.  It s right down the road from Dubai.  The survey showed that 65% of the Millennials said one of their top three goals in selecting a job was to make a difference in society, their city or country.  Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, of course they want that. They want to right wrongs. They want to correct social injustice wherever they see it. And when Ted Cruz gets going, that s ultimately what he s all about.He s all about everybody being the best they can be using their natural   he s conservative top to bottom, through and through, no matter how you slice it, left, right, up, down.  They also look for an opportunity to learn, followed by career advancement. More than nine out of 10 said they would be willing to relocate to advance their career.  That is the number one obstacle most people put in their own way. They re unwillingness to move. I ve always said that most of the obstacles people face in life are self-imposed, and the number one obstacle is the unwillingness to move. If you live in a place, let s say you want to be a brain surgeon and you live in a place where there s not a hospital, you re gonna have to move.If you want to get big in media and you live in Peoria, you re gonna have to move. And a lot of people don t want to move. The comfort level of being at home, friends, family, all that, it s a big obstacle. People get past that and nine out of 10 of these Millennials say they would be willing to relocate in order to advance their career, that s a big deal. Anyway, it s just a long way to go here and the Republican establishment has made it clear they are not interested in a conservative nominee. The Republican establishment has made it clear that the role of conservatives in this primary is to once again split the vote and split money.It was the money, don t forget, it was the money that was gonna save Jeb, or, if not Jeb, the next chosen establishment candidate. And the money, the ads, are not working. The ads simply are not overcoming, and they always have, the opposition to some of these candidates.

It doesn t have to be there. The Electoral College, a mechanism for indirect election of the president created by the Founding Fathers as a compromise between smaller states and larger states, is clearly laid out in Article II of the Constitution:  Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress. Perez has previously stated that President Donald Trump  didn t win  last November s election because Hillary Clinton won the popular vote:Following his comment, Perez went on to explain his hopes that states agree to a  national popular vote compact,  in which states agree to give their allocated electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. There s a national popular vote compact in which a number of states have passed a bill that says, we will allocate our vote, our electoral votes, to the person who wins the national popular vote once other states totaling 170 electoral votes do the same,  Perez said.  I m frankly proud to tell you that the first state to pass such a law was Maryland. The main supporters of the plan put forward by Perez seem to understand it is a plan to circumvent the system created by the Constitution, not an argument that the system doesn t exist.The comment from Perez came during a lecture honoring former Indiana Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh, who was accused last year of sexual assault by a writer who said Bayh groped her in the backseat of a limousine. VIA: WFBOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE:PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH THE CLUELESS LEFT!   If the president were elected by unfiltered national vote, small and rural states would become irrelevant, and campaigns would spend their time in large, populous districts.   The Electoral College remains in place over two centuries after the framers of the Constitution empowered it to select presidents. Though occasionally maligned, this system of electing a chief executive has been incredibly successful for the American people.The Founding Fathers created the Electoral College after much debate and compromise, but it has provided stability to the process of picking presidents. Though the winner of the national popular vote typically takes the presidency, that vote failed to determine the winner in four elections: 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000.Some see the Electoral College as a peculiar and mystifying institution that ensures only a few, select individuals will ever cast a direct vote for president in the United States. Others complain that the system rewards smaller states with more proportional power than the large ones.Every four years, around election time, there are murmurs about revamping the system and moving toward a direct, national popular vote.The Founders  CollegeAs one of The Heritage Foundations legal experts, Hans von Spakovsky, noted in a paper on the Electoral College:  In creating the basic architecture of the American government, the Founders struggled to satisfy each state s demand for greater representation while attempting to balance popular sovereignty against the risk posed to the minority from majoritarian rule. Some elements of the Electoral College, such as the indirect vote through intermediaries, were hotly debated at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. It was eventually justified in part as a stopgap to potentially reverse the vote if the people elected a criminal, traitor, or similar kind of heinous person. The Founders wanted to empower democratic elements in the American system, but they feared a kind of pure, unrestrained democracy that had brought down great republics of the past.The product of the Founders  compromise has been well balanced and enduring, and we would be wise to leave it intact.Alexander Hamilton defended the Electoral College in Federalist 68. He argued that it was important for the people as a whole to have a great deal of power in choosing their president, but it was also  desirable  that  the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. Hamilton also wrote that this system of intermediaries would produce a greater amount of stability, and that an     intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes. As students of ancient history, the Founders feared the destructive passions of direct democracy, and as recent subjects of an overreaching monarch, they equally feared the rule of an elite unresponsive to the will of the people. The Electoral College was a compromise, neither fully democratic nor aristocratic.The Constitution states:Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the Congress.In addition to balancing the protection of individual rights and majority rule, the Founding Fathers attempted to create a  federalist  system that would keep most of policymaking power reserved to states and localities. America s presidential election system also was designed to empower the states, not just the American people as an undifferentiated mass.The total number of electors and thus electoral votes across all states and the District of Columbia included after the passage of the 23rd Amendment adds up to 538. The winner must receive a majority, or 270, of these votes to become president.The system empowers states, especially smaller ones, because it incentivizes presidential candidates to appeal to places that may be far away from population centers. Farmers in Iowa may have very different concerns than bankers in New York. A more federalist system of electing presidents takes that into account.The states are free to select the method in which they choose their electors. In the early days of the republic, most states chose to have their legislatures pick electors, rather than the people. But, over time, the states shifted to choosing electors via the state s popular vote instead. Every state has opted for popular election at least since the Civil War.Calls to AbolishModern opponents of the Electoral College argue against what they call antidemocratic aspects of the institution, criticizing both the intermediary electors and the state-by-state system of voting.Calls to fundamentally change the Electoral College reached a peak after Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore in the tightly contested 2000 election. Gore narrowly won the national popular vote, and many of his supporters howled that the system even without the Supreme Court stepping in was unfair.One organization, National Popular Vote, has worked toward eliminating the Electoral College through an amendment to the Constitution or a state compact. National Popular Vote argues that the current system encourages presidential candidates to spend most of their time in  swing states  rather than campaigning for votes across the entire country.This plan for a national popular vote has received a moderate level of support, but Heritage s von Spakovsky has called it bad policy, based on mistaken assumptions. Swing states, he wrote,  can change from election to election, and many states that are today considered to be reliably  blue  or  red  in the presidential race were recently unpredictable. Many states have signed on to a bill that essentially would tie a state s electoral votes to the national popular vote. Those states will pledge to swing all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national vote.But this is because the incentives would be to appeal only to the biggest population centers. Swing states change over time, and the 2016 election could be a prime example of swing-state unpredictability and erosion of the traditional partisan political map.Additionally, if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote, small and rural states would become irrelevant, and campaigns would spend their time in large, populous districts.FINALLY ARE THE DEMOCRATS PROUD OF THIS DISGUSTING MAN WHO CURSES AND LIES?Read more: Daily Signal",DNC CHAIR PEREZ Says Trump ‘Didn’t Win’…Decides To Rewrite Constitution Without Electoral College…
"Oct 27, 2015","Does this mean Republicans in the House are FINALLY going to start standing up for the Americans who elected them to be their representatives in Washington DC? Does this action represent the change we re all desperate to see now that Boehner is vacating his seat? House Republicans on Tuesday introduced a resolution to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, accusing him of making  false statements  under oath and failing to comply with a subpoena for evidence.In case you ve forgotten, here are two of the most powerful testimonies exposing the tyranny of our government  we have ever posted on our website:Our friend Becky Gerritson (who is currently running for a seat in our US Congress):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4_MT8MkIAAnd then there was the powerful testimony by Founder and Chairman of True the Vote, Catherine Engelbrecht:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db21AQu30XwHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and 18 other committee members introduced the resolution to begin impeachment proceedings. In doing so, they followed through on a threat first made over the summer, when Republicans accused the IRS leader of making inaccurate statements to Congress regarding the Tea Party targeting scandal and its aftermath. Commissioner Koskinen violated the public trust,  Chaffetz said in a statement Tuesday.  He failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress. The IRS issued a statement later Thursday saying,  The IRS vigorously disputes the allegations in the resolution. We have fully cooperated with all of the investigations. The announcement of the impeachment resolution comes on the same day Koskinen testified before the Senate Finance Committee, and after the Justice Department on Friday decided to close its investigation of the targeting scandal without pursuing criminal charges.

"Oct 28, 2016","Crooked Hillary has always been crooked. She s just been better than anyone America s ever seen at not getting caught On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is  rigged. Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,  said Sen. Clinton.  And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. Chomsky recalls being taken aback that  anyone could support the idea offered by a national political leader, no less that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections. Some eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.For entire story: Observer",WHOA! 2006: HILLARY CLINTON CAUGHT Expressing Regret About Not Rigging Palestinian Elections

"Oct 3, 2015","This certainly isn t who the GOP power-brokers want to see in the top two Donald Trump has boasted that he s  leading every poll and in most cases big.  Not anymore. The latest IBD/TIPP Poll shows him in second place, seven points behind Ben Carson.The nationwide survey found that 24% of Republicans back Carson, compared with 17% who say they support Trump.Marco Rubio came in third with 11% and Carly Fiorina fourth at 9%. Jeb Bush, once considered a prohibitive favorite, ranked fifth with just 8% support, which was a point lower than those who say they are still undecided.The IBD/TIPP Poll has a proven track record for accuracy, based on its performance in the past three presidential elections. In a comparison of the final results of various pollsters for the 2004 and 2008 elections, IBD/TIPP was the most accurate. And the New York Times concluded that IBD/TIPP was the most accurate among 23 polls over the three weeks leading up to the 2012 election.The October poll, conducted from Sept. 26 to Oct. 1, included 377 registered voters who are Republican or registered independents who lean toward the Republican Party, with a margin of error of +/- 5 percentage points.Peak Trump? Other polls show Trump s support slipping in recent weeks. The Real Clear Politics average of six national polls shows him falling from 30.5% in mid-September to 23.3% by the end of the month. That average does not include the IBD/TIPP findings.  Things appear to be catching up with Trump on multiple fronts,  said Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, which conducts IBD s monthly poll.  In addition to facing increasing attacks from other candidates, Trump s boycott of Fox News may have set him back,  Mayur said, noting that the poll was being conducted during Trump s self-imposed hiatus.When asked on CNBC about his slipping poll numbers, Trump said that  if I fell behind badly, I would certainly get out. Carson s gain comes after his controversial remarks on  Meet the Press  that he couldn t support a Muslim for president. See story here. Rubio s third-place standing shows he has gained considerable ground since the second GOP debate.

It makes you wonder if they have training programs abroad in how to buy convenience stores in the US and rip off the dumb (infidel) Americans!$20 MILLION LOST IN FOOD STAMP SCAM:  In this instance, eight small convenience stores in South Florida committed a staggering amount of fraud in a relatively short amount of time,  said Karen Citizen-Wilcox, special agent in charge, U.S. Department of Agriculture-Office of the Inspector General, in a release.  These retailers created an illegal benefits exchange system that defrauded the American taxpayer and denied healthy foods to needy children and their families. The store owners who allegedly orchestrated this trafficking scheme pocketed millions in  fees  which they charged for converting food assistance benefits into cash. Some of the defendants owned, worked at or operated stores authorized to accept Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program payments, known as SNAP. Others worked at stores not authorized, but allegedly used the point-of-sale terminals for stores that were authorized.The fraud happened like this, according to authorities: A store clerk swipes a person s electronic benefits card at a point-of-sale terminal for a large amount. The person with the card is paid a lesser amount in cash. The remainder is ill-gotten profit for the store owner.The bust from Operation Stampede/Cash Hungry in Florida involved more than $13 million in fraudulent food-stamp transactions and could be the largest food stamp bust in the nation s history. The Palm Beach County Sheriff s Office, state and federal law enforcement conducted a joint identity theft investigation involving obtaining SNAP EBT cards with the stolen identities. According to the sheriff s office, the fraudulently obtained EBT cards were taken to the Opa Locka Flea Market where the SNAP(food stamp or EBT) benefits allocated to them were exchanged for cash. Twenty two people have been charged with crimes.Saleh managed Four Corners convenience store, 821 NW Sixth St. in Fort Lauderdale, which wasn t authorized to take SNAP payments. Prosecutors say Saleh and other Four Corners employees used the point-of-sale terminals at Liberty City s Sparkle, 6530 NW 18th Ave., run by Alobaisi. Prosecutors say that from April 2015 through this past August, Saleh, Alobaisi and employees Francois, Hassouna, Alteen, Jerdana and Baker stole $2 million with the scheme.Case No. 2 involved Zahran, also known as Youssef Hussein, who worked at Pompano Beach s Community Food Store, 401 NW 27th Ave. He is being accused of being on the fraud train a relatively short time, Nov. 3, 2016, through Jan. 11.Hajje and Hajyousef owned Steve Market 2 and Yum-Yum s grocery, stores across the street from each other at 6804 NW 15th Ave. and 6813 NW 15th Ave. in Miami s Liberty City neighborhood.

Media using Christopher Harper-Mercer and Chris Harper-Mercer.Several months ago The Last Refuge shared the story of Eric Sheppard Jr. a radical  Black Lives Matter ,  F**k The Police  and Islamic radical who used a philosophy of black supremacy similar to the New Black Panthers. Sheppard gained brief notoriety when he held a U.S. Flag Stomping event at Valdosta State University.After his public exposure, and after the police filed a warrant for his arrest on firearms violations, and after he mailed a racist manifesto to a local Georgia Newspaper   while on the run, he was finally arrested in Tampa Florida by U.S. Marshals.Eric Sheppard s story disappeared from the headlines and never resurfaced. Yesterday, while reviewing the social footprint of Oregon shooter Chris Harper-Mercer, (aka Chris Sean Mercer) an almost identical world-view to Eric Sheppard Jr. was evident in Mercer s social media history.Chris Harper-Mercer, a mixed-race angry 26-year-old, was essentially the mirror image on social media as Eric Sheppard Jr.Mercer held sympathetic words and thoughts for the Virginia shooter Vester Flanagan, and similarly raged against white people, and expressed sympathy toward the Black Lives Matter movement. (Example Below):However, today almost all of that social media history is GONE -> Example Here. It is either removed entirely, and/or edited for content.

Sheppard Jr) to a surviving student of the shooting.Summary: The immediate on-line web history of Chris Harper-Mercer showed him to be a mixed-race, angry young man in general alignment with various radical racially aligned groups such as Black Lives Matter, Fuck The Police and Fuck Yo Flag   all of which carry a sentiment of favorability and ideological alignment with Islam which was similarly evident in the Ferguson protest movement.[ Against this backdrop shooting  White   Christians  makes sense. ]However, in the course of several hours (one media cycle)   the media narrative is selling a profile of a loner, mentally disturbed individual without any mention of his previous writings (deleted/changed), behaviors (hidden) and social tendencies (ignored).Why?Perhaps the answer lies within the response to the shooting from the White House where President Obama took quickly to the microphones to decry another school shooting without fully understanding the motive and intent.Watch Obama s speech following the Oregon mass shooting.

"Oct 5, 2015","Mums the word on Christian persecution in the White House.  Just let them get a whiff of possible injustice against a Muslim in America and Obama s radicalized DOJ is on it, like a dog on a bone In its latest effort to protect Muslim rights in the United States the Obama Justice Department is suing an Illinois town for denying a rezoning application to convert an office building into an Islamic temple. Failing to approve plans for the Islamic worship center violates a 2000 law known as the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), according to a Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuit filed this week in federal court. The accused are lawmakers in Des Plaines, a Chicago suburb with a population of about 60,000. In 2013 the Des Plaines City Council voted 5-3 to reject a rezoning request made by the American Islamic Center (AIC) to make a vacant office building in a manufacturing zone to an institutional zone that would allow a worship center.The plan called for 3,661 square feet of worship space that would be used for prayer services on Fridays and Sundays as well as nightly prayers during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan when Muslims fast and commemorate the first revelation of the Quran to Muhammad. The new temple would also be used for youth group events and other gatherings, according the rezoning application.In nixing the plan, Des Plaines aldermen expressed concern about the loss of tax revenue since religious institutions are nonprofits that don t pay taxes. They also cited traffic and safety issues for voting against the project.In its lawsuit the DOJ dismisses those issues and claims that the city s  treatment and denial of AICs rezoning requests constitutes the imposition or implementation of a land use regulation that imposes a substantial burden on AICs religious exercise.  Denying a city zoning change to accommodate a Muslim temple also discriminates against the Islamic group on the basis of religion, according to the feds. Attorney General Loretta Lynch wants the court to issue an order forcing Des Plaines to let AIC construct its worship center in the city. The ability to establish a place for collective worship is a fundamental protection of the First Amendment and our civil rights laws,  said Vanita Gupta, head of the DOJ s bloated civil rights division, in a statement announcing the lawsuit.  The Justice Department will remain vigilant in its mission to ensure that all religious groups enjoy the right to practice their faiths freely.  The federal prosecutor handling the case in Illinois said  the freedom to practice the religion of one s choosing is a precious right in our country  and the DOJ will continue to  enforce the laws that protect this important right. The DOJ s enthusiasm for protecting Muslim rights is in a class of its own, however. Back in 2010 Obama s first Attorney General, Eric Holder, personally reassured Muslims of DOJ protection during an address at a San Francisco-based organization (Muslim Advocates) that urges members not to cooperate in federal terrorism investigations. It was a first for the nation s top federal prosecutor to publicly condone illegal behavior. A few years later the DOJ warned against using social media to spread information considered inflammatory against Muslims and threatened that it could constitute a violation of civil rights.One of the biggest and most unbelievable moves by the DOJ came in 2012 when it issued a broad order changing the way the U.S. government trains federal agents to combat terrorism and violent extremism by eliminating all materials that shed a negative light on Muslims. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) actually destroyed instructional material that characterized Muslims as prone to violence or terrorism and hundreds of pages from the 9/11 attacks were purged because they were considered offensive to Muslims under the new initiative.In 2013 Judicial Watch published an in-depth report documenting and analyzing Islamist active measures and influence operations targeting anti-terrorism training in the U.S.Via: Family Security Matters",UNBELIEVABLE: IL City Denies Re-zoning Request For Islamic Worship Center…That’s When Obama’s Radical DOJ Stepped In

The employee told the FBI that,  Initially, IPS officials were told there were 14 bankers boxes of former Secretary of State Hillary CLINTON s emails at CLINTON s Friendship Heights office.  Friendship Heights is a neighborhood that straddles the Northwest neighborhood of the District of Columbia and Maryland.The State Department witness further explained to the FBI that  on or about December 5, 2014, IPS personnel picked up only 12 bankers boxes of CLINTON s emails from Williams & Connolly. The officials were not sure if the boxes  were consolidated or what could have happened to the two other boxes.  Clinton s chief lawyer at Williams & Connolly, who leads all Clinton-related legal matters, is David Kendall. He has successfully represented Bill and Hillary Clinton together and separately throughout decades of their legal entanglements since the 1980 s, ranging from the former president s sex scandals to missing billing records for Hillary Clinton s work as a partner in The Rose Law Firm on behalf of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and Capital Management Services.In the documents provided by Kendall s law firm, the witness told the FBI they were  unable to locate any of her emails from January-April 2009.

"Oct 7, 2015","THE H-1B VISA PROGRAM IS KILLING JOBS FOR NATIVE AMERICANS! It was just reported in the recent jobs numbers that native-born Americans are losing jobs while immigrant employment is up. Corporations like Disney are bringing in foreign workers with the H-1B visa and having the American employees train the foreign worker for their job. Talk about adding insult to injury! This needs to stop but Washington lobbyists and the Chamber of Commerce really can t help themselves they love that cheap labor. The discrimination against Americans is very real and it s about time the workers fought back!Some U.S. IT workers who have been replaced with H-1B contractors are alleging discrimination and are going to court. They are doing so in increasing numbers.There are at least seven IT workers at Disney who are pursuing, or plan to pursue, federal and state discrimination administrative complaints over their layoffs. Another Disney worker, still employed by the firm, has filed a state administrative discrimination complaint in California. These complaints are a first step to litigation.Separately, there are ongoing court cases alleging discrimination against two of the largest India-based IT services firms, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services. The federal judges in each of cases have given a green light for the plaintiffs to proceed after rejecting dismissal efforts.There may be federal interest in examining this issue. The U.S. Department of Justice s Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices was asked by 10 U.S. senators in April to examine the IT layoffs at Southern California Edison (SCE) and to determine whether SCE or its contractors were  engaged in prohibited citizenship status discrimination. What s being challenged, in sum, is the job replacement system created by the H-1B program. U.S. IT workers, as a condition for their severance, are being made to train H-1B visa-holding contractor replacements to take over their jobs.The contractors often work for IT services firms that employ large numbers of H-1B workers. Most of these workers are from India and regional countries. This practice of replacing U.S. workers with foreign workers constitutes national origin discrimination, say its critics.The court case against Tata, whose plaintiffs include a former SCE employee, alleges that some 95% of its employees are South Asian or mostly Indian. Tata has called the allegations baseless.The Disney IT workers  were terminated because they were American citizens and all their replacements were foreign-born Indians,  said Sara Blackwell, a Florida attorney, who is representing seven of the Disney workers at its parks and resort division. She has set up an organizationto challenge the practice. Other discrimination claims, including age and disability, will be made as well. Those complaints are being filed with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, which sees if a settlement is possible prior to any lawsuit.Disney did not respond immediately for comment. We need to protect American workers,  said James Otto, a California attorney who is representing a Disney ABC Television Group employee in that state. This complaint is being filed in California under the state s Fair Employment and Housing Act, which Otto said is similar to the federal process, but with more protections.Otto s client still works at Disney and had been targeted for an earlier layoff, but Disney rescinded those layoffs. Nonetheless, the complaints being made include a hostile workforce and national origin discrimination.Read more: Computer World",American Workers Finally Fighting Back Against Corporations Replacing Them With Cheaper Foreign Labor

"Oct 8, 2015","Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has dropped out of the race for House Speaker. The reason he gave to the Republican Caucus for dropping out:  I am not the right person to lead at this moment.  McCarthy was expected to win the Speakership in a landslide but his comments on Benghazi were frowned upon by his fellow Republicans. McCarthy s mistake of saying the Benghazi investigation was all about politics was exactly what Hillary Clinton needed to revive her campaign. Ultimately, he was concerned he could not get the 218 votes needed to win: McCarthy s decision, announced moments before Republicans were set to nominate their candidate, will postpone the vote for speaker. McCarthy had been running against Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Daniel Webster, R-Fla., before he dropped out, and it s unclear whether other candidates will now step forward.While McCarthy, R-Calif., faced vocal opposition from some conservative members and groups, he was thought to have more than enough support to win the party s nomination in the vote initially set for Thursday. Fox News is told McCarthy, in revealing his choice, simply told colleagues it was not his time.His withdrawal rattled fellow lawmakers, particularly allies in leadership.

"Oct 8, 2016","For decades Hillary Clinton has claimed that back in the 1970s the U.S. Marines rejected her because she was a woman. But a look at some of the information released by Wikileaks reveals that the Democrat nominee has more recently changed her story and admitted that the Marines did not reject her because of her gender.One of the earliest reports on Hillary s rejection claim came from The New York Times  Maureen Dowd, who in 1994 reported Clinton s claims as delivered at an event meant to honor military women hosted at the Capital in Washington D.C.Dowd reported that Hillary told those gathered that she was rejected by the Marines because she was a woman. Dowd wrote that in 1975, the year she married Bill Clinton and when she was teaching at the University of Arkansas law school in Fayetteville, Hillary said she went to the Marines to see if she could sign up.She was 27 then, she said, and the Marine recruiter was about 21. She was interested in joining either the active forces or the reserves, she recalled, but was swiftly rebuffed by the recruiter, who took a dim view of her age and her thick glasses.  Not Very Encouraging. You re too old, you can t see and you re a woman,  Mrs. Clinton said she was told, adding that the recruiter dismissed her by suggesting she try the Army.  Maybe the dogs would take you,  she recalled the recruiter saying. It was not a very encouraging conversation,  she said.  I decided maybe I ll look for another way to serve my country. Flash forward to one of her speeches in 2013 that Wikileaks just published. somehow, the lie she told so many years ago had morphed into the fact that the Marines wouldn t take her because they felt she was too old:This according to the excerpt from her 2013 appearance:Question from the audience: Is it true that until 1975 you applied for the Marines and they told you no because you were a female?Hillary: No. Here is what did happen: It was actually   there was a recruiting station, and I thought, you know, maybe I should consider serving my country by joining the military. So I walked into the recruiting station, and the person on duty was a Marine. And I think I was 26, maybe 27, so, an older potential recruit. I said to the young Marine, I said,  Well, you know, I d be interested in getting some information to see whether I could maybe serve. I m a lawyer. Maybe I could help in some way.  He says,  Well, I think you are too old for the Marines but maybe the dogs will take you.  I said,  The dogs?  He goes,  Yeah, you know, the Army.

She said she would set her middle class tax pledge aside. This took place Jan. 12 in Iowa, and it s on video:Moderator:  Democrats have introduced a plan that Senator Sanders supports that you ve come out against because it is funded by a payroll tax. If that were to reach your desk as President, would you veto it in order to make good on your tax pledge?

Bernie Sanders called out Hillary s violation of her middle class tax pledge: Frankly, I am very surprised that Secretary Clinton would support this regressive tax after pledging not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. This proposal clearly violates her pledge,  he said.Sanders also said:  The mechanism here is fairly regressive. And that is, it will be increasing taxes on low-income and working people. 25% National Gun Tax   Hillary endorsed a new national 25% retail sales tax on guns.  I am all for that,  she told the Senate in 1993. On June 5, 2016 she was asked about her gun tax endorsement by George Stephanopoulos on ABC s This Week.

"October 18, 2017 "," (This Oct. 18 story corrects age in paragraph 19 to five, not six) By Tom Bergin LONDON (Reuters) - The bill for compensating families of those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London may be as low as 4 million pounds ($5 million), according to several lawyers and a Reuters analysis of how damages laws apply in England. The blaze engulfed a 24-storey social housing block in west London on June 14, killing an estimated 80 people in the country s deadliest fire since World War Two. While similar disasters in the United States have led to massive payouts, any compensation for Grenfell would be far lower because English laws offer less generous damages and don t allow punitive claims, even if companies are found criminally responsible, said Brett Dixon, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL). The four main firms that have been linked to the Grenfell fire - U.S. companies Arconic Inc. and Whirlpool Corp. and Britain s Harley Facades and Rydon Group - declined to comment on the size or calculation of potential payouts. The Reuters calculation of a bill of 4 million pounds is based on the compensation amounts stipulated in the Fatal Accidents Act of 1976, precedents set in previous cases and the individual circumstances of the 70 victims identified so far. Three personal injury lawyers have verified the methodology used by Reuters and said the estimate for the total payout is reasonable. If the courts find there was no unlawful behavior by any of the companies or public bodies involved, victims will not be entitled to sue for compensation and would only get the financial support and temporary housing already provided by the government and public donations, personal injury lawyers said.  The British judicial system is not renowned for being generous,  said Rebecca Thomas of law firm Duncan Lewis, which is representing some victims  families.  It s not about money for the families,  said Tim Murphy, whose brother Denis, a disabled former painter who lived on the 14th floor, died in the fire.  Nothing can ease our pain, (but) I think it s quite insulting.  The U.S. legal system sees punitive damages as a way of encouraging companies to behave lawfully, but British and European governments have taken the view this approach would put excessive burdens on the judicial system, businesses, insurers and state bodies that might be liable, some legal experts say. While APIL said the Grenfell Tower disaster demonstrated the inadequacy of payouts to victims, Duncan Fairgrieve, who has advised the UK government on compensation rules, said more generous payouts could also harm society. They could drive up insurance costs for all and lead to big claims against government bodies such as the National Health Service and the police, he said.  There is an affordability issue,  said Fairgrieve, a Senior Research Fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. If the courts find someone was wrongfully killed, the claim categories are a flat 12,980 pounds per victim for bereavement, costs such as funeral bills, dependency damages where minors or dependent spouses are left behind, and property damage - all to be paid by the party found responsible. Under the 1976 law, only family members who were supported by those who died can claim dependency damages. Reuters has identified only five people who died leaving dependents who could definitely claim damages - on the basis they were financially dependent on the deceased. Daniel Machover, a lawyer at Hickman and Rose, which is representing some victims  families, also said he didn t expect there to be many claims. Most of the others who died in the fire were minors, single or elderly and did not leave family members who were financially dependent upon them. The biggest dependency payout will be for children who lost both parents, said lawyers representing some of the victims. One five-year-old girl, Tasnim Belkadi, lost her mother, father and all her siblings in the fire. Lawyers said she could get 300,000 pounds, based on a share of her parents  income and some childcare costs up to her 18th birthday. Her aunt, with whom she now lives, did not respond to requests for comment on the Reuters calculation. Grenfell plaintiffs can also claim expenses they incurred as the result of a death, such as the cost of a modest funeral. Heirs to the deceased could also claim the value of goods lost in the fire. The Association of British Insurers puts the cost of replacing the contents of an average three-bedroom home at 55,000 pounds. However, Thomas said Grenfell claims would probably be less than 30,000 pounds per property because compensation is based on the market value of personal belongings rather than replacement value, and the flats destroyed had only one or two bedrooms. Based on the victims  circumstances, Reuters has calculated the payout for dependency damages could be 1.2 million pounds, for property it could be 1.4 million and for bereavement it could come to 1.0 million. Other smaller claims for costs and loss of parental guidance take the total to 4 million pounds. Police said the fire started in a fridge freezer made by a subsidiary of U.S. company Whirlpool and have been investigating whether the tower s cladding, made by U.S. firm Arconic Inc., played a role in the spread of the blaze. Arconic said it was up to contractors to ensure its products were used correctly. Whirlpool said it was investigating the fire. Rydon Group, the contractor that oversaw the refurbishment when the new cladding was added, said it had complied with all regulations. Sub-contractor Harley Facades Ltd said it was not aware of any link between the fire and the cladding. Fears among investors that companies linked to Grenfell could be sued for large sums in the United States hit their shares. Whirlpool s market value fell about $250 million on June 23 when police identified the maker of the appliance as Hotpoint, a brand owned by Indesit, which is a subsidiary of Whirlpool based in Italy. More than $1 billion was wiped off Arconic Inc. s value after Reuters reported in June that internal emails showed it had supplied flammable cladding panels, knowing they would be used on the tower and despite warning in its brochures that only non-combustible panels should be used on tall buildings. Arconic s share price has recovered since its late June lows but it and Whirlpool s stock are below the levels they were at just before the fire, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 7 percent over the same period. Awards against companies in U.S. courts have run into the tens of millions of dollars per family in some cases. In 1980, a fire blamed in part on inadequate fire safety measures killed 85 people at the MGM Grand Hotel in Nevada and injured hundreds. The hotel operator and contractors agreed to pay victims  families and survivors more than $200 million. Foreigners have often tried to sue U.S. corporations in U.S. courts over alleged wrongdoing abroad. However, judges have consistently ruled they lacked jurisdiction in such cases, saying adequate tribunals existed in the plaintiff s own country and that it would be hard for defendants to make their case in the United States. Machover at Hickman and Rose said he was considering whether Grenfell victims could bring a U.S. case on the basis that two of the companies involved were based there. But Thomas at Duncan Lewis and Leigh Day partner Jill Paterson were skeptical that U.S. courts would agree to hear Grenfell claims given the United Kingdom offers a reasonable forum for redress and because the U.S. companies were involved through European-registered subsidiaries.  I can t see any circumstances under which they could bring this in the United States,  said Thomas. Arconic and Whirlpool declined to comment on the possibility of legal claims against them.

To prevent religious discrimination, the state of Illinois plans to start mailing fliers to employees at offices that issue drivers licenses and photo IDs to remind them that people are not required to remove  articles of faith  for their photos. The state s efforts follow complaints from Muslim and Sikh agencies that some residents have been asked to remove religious head coverings.The Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund brought the issue to Illinois  Secretary of State s office about a year ago after Sikh residents complained that they had been asked to take off their dastaars, the turbans Sikhs wear around their heads, for photos. We had been getting complaints from around the states from Sikh Americans who were being asked to remove or modify their turbans to get their photo ID,  the executive director Jasjit Singh told Fusion Friday.Muslims became the state s fastest growing and third-largest group in 2012, according to the Chicago Tribune. And while there is no readily available state data about the Sikh population, there are half a million Sikhs living in the United States.A spokesperson for Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White emphasized to Fusion that it has always been illegal to ask people to remove their head covering, and that the fliers serve as a reminder for government employees of how to respect religious diversity. No change has actually taken place to our procedures,  said Henry Haupt, Deputy Press Secretary for the Secretary of State s office.  What we re doing was always allowed the religious head coverings of this nature but what we want to ensure is that the public s aware of them because we were told that some individuals were unaware that they could have their photo taken for the drivers license wearing them. We re always mindful of the fact that we want to communicate well with the public. Via: IB Times",SAY WHAT?!

Is the timing with Joe Biden s (Obama s puppet) entry into the Presidential race and the release of more damning evidence against Hillary accidental or is the Chicago mob politician just getting warmed up It looks like Hillary might be beaten by Barack yet again The Denver-based company that stored Hillary Clinton s private email server said that the emails might still be recoverable, because there s no evidence that the server was properly wiped clean. Platte River has no knowledge of the server being wiped,  Platte River representative Andy Boian told The Washington Post.  All the information we have is that the server wasn t wiped. If the server was not wiped clean, and investigators can still get all of the information off it, then Clinton-World s attempts to stonewall the investigation could be rendered null and void.Clinton did, in fact, delete all of her emails earlier this year, but it is possible that she never managed to physically damage the server itself to the degree that all of the information on it would be lost forever. Thus, the server, which is now in the possession of the FBI and Department of Justice investigators, could still pull up some of the confidential emails that Clinton thought would never see the light of day.But Platte River s statement to The Post might also be an example of the company running interference for the Clintons.Boian, it should be noted, is representing Platte River Networks through his small, Colorado-based public relations firm Dovetail Solutions, which also employs top Clinton operative David Goodfriend, a major Washington cyber security lobbyist and friend of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Platte River Networks  vice president David DeCamillis also went to high school with Clinton s 2008 tech chief Nathaniel Pearlman, who supervised Clinton s server manager Bryan Pagliano.Pagliano has pleaded the Fifth to protect himself from having to give up any information about his work on Clinton s server.Via: Breitbart",NOT BREAKING…HILLARY LIKELY LIED: Does Obama’s Support For Biden Have Anything To Do With New Bombshell Discovery That Hillary’s E-mails “Might Still Be Recoverable”

"Sep 14, 2016","Who knew, that one of the wealthiest entertainers in America and the New Black Panthers biggest cheerleader, has a sister who is also a perpetual victim of racism? When she s not beating the shit out of her brother-in-law Jay-Z in an elevator, Solange Knowles is a professional victim of racism. Beyonc s crazier less talented sister recently attended a concert, as a fan not as a performer, and wouldn t you know it, racism reared it s ugly head. Apparently someone asked her to sit down and since she is black, it was a hostile act of racial aggression.If you have nothing better to do, and haven t already witnessed the circus that ensues when a celebrity husband cheats on his celebrity wife with another woman, forcing the sister to even the score in an elevator, you can watch it here:Back to the Solange and her racist manifesto, where she goes to great lengths to explain the racism she encounters in just about every aspect of her life, like the time she got pulled over or the other time she had to show her passport crossing an international border. She describes the perpetrators of racism as,  a product of their white supremacy and are exercising it on you without caution, care, or thought. The main point of this crazy thing was what happened to her at a recent concert. It s written from a weird 2nd person perspective, but this is what I was able to figure out:Solange took her 11-year-old son to a Kraftwerk concert. They arrived late, despite Solange s claim that she is a big fan. Right off the bat an elderly black usher had to tell her son to stop vaping. Solange claims her young son was not vaping, so therefore it was racism.It gets worse. Solange was standing up and dancing when someone behind her asked her to sit down. She refused to sit and eventually someone threw a slice of lime at her. Again: racism. She turned around to confront whoever threw the lime but nobody s white privilege would let them admit to it. For the third time, she experienced racism.Granted, this is a one-sided explanation of things. It s entirely possible that Solange was being rude and obnoxious and the people behind her gave her a gentile reminder to behave herself in public. Then again, maybe none of this stuff even happened.The crazy level rises significantly when Solange tries to put her harrowing experience in perspective by saying:You constantly see the media having a hard time contextualizing black women and men as victims every day, even when it means losing their own lives.Shit, can you believe she almost died in this racist lime attack?She then says that she isn t claiming this incident was racism, even though she said it many times, and chides the media for potentially reporting it that way, followed immediately by this:This is why many black people are uncomfortable being in predominately white spacesFrom there Solange rants about all of the racism in America and ends with the odd statement that she has  many white friends.

God forbid you address the war on law enforcement (that you started), because it s not nearly as important to you as shining a spotlight on supposed racial inequality is it? President Barack Obama issued a personal invitation via Twitter to a Muslim high school student who got in trouble last week in Texas for bringing a home made  briefcase clock  to school, touching off a terrorism scare.Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.  President Obama (@POTUS44) September 16, 2015Fourteen year-old Ahmed Mohamed was taken in handcuffs by police from MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas after he brought his invention to school the Monday after the fourteenth anniversary of the 9/11 Islamist terror attacks on the U.S. An alarm for the briefcase clock went off in class, prompting a teacher to observe the devise looked like a bomb. Police investigated and on Wednesday announced no charges would be filed. Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It s what makes America great.At Wednesday s press briefing held right after Obama tweeted his invitation to Mohamed, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest attacked the teachers at Mohamed s school for erring on the side of caution in an era of Islamist terror attacks and  troubled student  school massacres.Earnest also announced Obama was inviting Mohamed to the White House Astronomy Night on October 19. (Quotes assembled from transcribing and various sources.) I think the president like many of us was struck by the news reports of this particular incident. The fact is that America s best teachers in our schools, in our best schools at least, nurture the intellectual curiosity of all of our students. In this instance it is clear that at least some of Ahmed s teachers failed him. That s too bad (It s not) too late for all of us to use this as a teachable moment. This episode is a good illustration of how pernicious stereotypes can prevent even goodhearted people who have dedicated their lives to educating young people from doing the good work they set out to do. This is an instance where you have people who have otherwise dedicated their lives to teach our children who failed in that effort, potentially because of some things in their conscience and the power of stereotypes. The White House was pleased to extend an invitation to Ahmed to participate in Astronomy Night. We ll bring together NASA scientists, others to spend time with young people. It will be an opportunity to talk about science, the solar system. It should be a good event. We re hopeful he ll feel right at home.

A severe food crisis is part of the socialist utopia that just keeps going downhill. What s next? Cannibalism?President Nicolas Maduro unveiled a government program called  Plan Rabbit  at a meeting with his agriculture minister, Freddy Bernal, that was broadcast on Periscope, CNN Money reported. It s a plan to distribute rabbits to communities across Venezuela to breed and eat. Maduro noted that rabbits breed quickly and are a good source of protein, but not cholesterol.GOVERNMENT PUSHES A  CHANGE IN CONSUMPTION PATTERNS The rabbit isn t a pet, it s only two and a half kilos of meat,  Bernal stressed in the streamed announcement. He then invoked President Donald Trump to push the program. Trump s attack against the Venezuelan people is an opportunity to revise and change cultural consumption patterns,  he said.Venezuelan opposition leaders immediately slammed the move. Are you serious?  asked former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles in a video response.  You want people to start raising rabbits to solve the problem of hunger in our country? A 2016 study found that three-fourths of Venezuelans had lost almost twenty pounds on average over the course of the year. Meat is particularly scarce in the South American nation, with citizens even resorting to butchering zoo animals, according to police.Most economists agree the mass hunger is the result of socialist government policies spearheaded by former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and Maduro, his successor. Chavez instituted price controls on many food items, which helped lead to shortages and massive inflation.We ve previously reported on shortages of food and even toilet paper in Venezuela.BYOTP! NO TOILET PAPER AND NO FOODSocialism doesn t work but I guess Venezuela didn t get the memo. No toilet paper? No food? Yes, it s come to that in this socialist hellhole Venezuela s product shortages have become so severe that some hotels in that country are asking guests to bring their own toilet paper and soap, a local tourism industry spokesman said on Wednesday .  It s an extreme situation,  says Xinia Camacho, owner of a 20-room boutique hotel in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada national park.  For over a year we haven t had toilet paper, soap, any kind of milk, coffee or sugar. So we have to tell our guests to come prepared.  Montilla says bigger hotels can circumvent product shortages by buying toilet paper and other basic supplies from black market smugglers who charge up to 6-times the regular price. But smaller, family-run hotels can t always afford to pay such steep prices, which means that sometimes they have to make do without.READ MORE: WFB ",Socialist Utopia of Venezuela Tells People to Eat Their Pets

We ve always admired his courage to stand up to union thugs who have done everything in their power to shut down his opposition to the Leftist, Democrat supporting unions. Brian penned this awesome letter to the Detroit Free Press. We d like to share it with you here:As a blue-collar worker in a UAW-represented plant, I m seeing an enthusiasm for a Republican candidate that I have not seen in the 20 years that I have worked at Ford Motor Co. There s a lot of talk about who will win the labor vote this season. But we have to ask, just who does the term  labor  actually represent when it is used today?In the 21st Century, labor unions increasingly represent college educated workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2015 nearly half of all union members worked for the government. Public sector workers (those paid with your tax dollars) are almost five times more likely to belong to a union than private sector workers. And while unionized workers in Michigan can now refuse to pay union dues, even while working under the terms of a negotiated contract thanks to Right to Work, many feel intimidated and are afraid to exercise that right due to veiled threats from union bosses and some coworkers.The support that Donald Trump has from union families and blue collar workers may be surprising to some. Two polls cited in the Free Press recently showed that 30% of those who said there is a union member in their household plan to vote for Trump. But you have to look beyond measures of union-represented workers. Today, many blue-collar workers, including some represented by unions that have endorsed Hillary Clinton, are looking to Donald Trump s candidacy to return the power to them, and bring jobs back to America that left after bad trade deals, including NAFTA.In an online poll conducted for Bloomberg News, 55% of whites with no more than a high school degree, said they support Trump. In my plant, there are a lot of people who are saying  I m voting for Trump and I m not ashamed of it. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has supported NAFTA and the TPP in the past, while Donald Trump has promised to re-negotiate NAFTA and to oppose the TPP. Union members like that kind of talk, and that s why so many of them are breaking with their union bosses to support Donald Trump.Brian PannebeckerFORD Assembly Line Worker, MI","WOW!

"Sep 18, 2015","Yeah, because taking Trump down is more important to these flame throwers on the left (and right) than exposing the truth about Obama s  overt allegiance to Muslims living in America and the actual Muslim training camps that are taking place across America right now.Donald Trump pulled out of a Republican gathering in South Carolina Friday as he took hits from members of both parties for failing to correct a questioner who said President Obama is a Muslim. Mr. Trump has a significant business transaction that was expected to close Thursday. Due to the delay he is unable to attend today s Heritage Action Presidential Forum,  Trump s campaign announced in a release Friday.Trump had been scheduled to join most of the Republican field at the meeting of the influential conservative group.Trump drew condemnation Friday from some of his rivals for his failure to confront the questioner at a New Hampshire town hall who had labeled the president a Muslim, asked what he would do to  get rid  of Muslims and mentioned Islamic  training camps. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told NBC Friday,  I wouldn t have permitted that. If someone brought that up at a town hall meeting of mine, I would ve said,  No, listen. Before we answer, let s clear some things up for the rest of the audience. And I think you have an obligation as a leader to do that. If that person had been in my event I would have called him out in it,  Hillary Clinton said at a press conference after a campaign event in New Hampshire. Not only is it out of place and wrong it is totally factually untrue.  Sen. Bernie Sanders demanded that Trump apologize for  continuing the lie that the president is not an American and not a Christian. FOX News   Hidden in a remote area off a primitive dirt road lies a mysterious 70-acre compound in which more than 100 Muslims live in seclusion, following the teachings of its founder, a radical cleric with alleged ties to terrorism.It s neither a Taliban stronghold outside Jalalabad, nor an extremist madrassa on the outskirts of Karachi.It s a place called Islamberg, a closed and seemingly quiet community at the foot of the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York, about three hours north of Manhattan.It s also a compound shrouded in local rumors, mystery   and fear   sitting near the huge reservoir system that provides New York City with most of its drinking water.Quietly nestled in the woods, Islamberg remained unnoticed for the two decades leading up to Sept. 11, 2001, when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked by a determined band of Islamic extremists.That s when people started questioning the community s ties to a Pakistani cleric allegedly connected to worldwide terrorism. They also started talking about the unusual sounds of gunfire and explosions some said they heard emanating from the compound.But before you leap to conclusions and head to the Catskills to personally fight the war on terror   you need to know the entire story. The truth, as is often the case, is a lot more complicated than the headlines suggest.Islamberg got its start about 20 years ago, when   inspired by the words of the Sufi cleric Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani   a group of primarily black Muslims from Brooklyn left New York City to escape crime, poverty and racism. Aiming to lead what they believed was a peaceful and holy Muslim life, they built a community of some 40 family houses, their own grocery store and a bookstore.And they weren t alone. Other groups, also inspired by Gilani, have set up similiar communities in 19 other states. According to the group s own Web site, the Islamberg community is still  struggling,  and is asking for donations to complete its mosque.According to locals, the land previously belonged to a Deposit, N.Y., woman who opened up her home in the in the late 1970s or early  80s to disadvantaged youths from the city so that they could avoid being led astray by a financially and morally bankrupt urban environment.Those boys, according to locals who were friendly with some of the group, eventually went on to form Islamberg, and at some point they were joined by another group of more militant Muslims, who created something of a rival faction within the community.The group lived quietly there for years with little interaction with the local communities except for forays into town for supplies or to sell baked goods at the weekly flea market. Some of the men had jobs at a local credit-processing center or working for the Port Authority in New York City (where they are said to maintain a residence near a bridge that runs between two boroughs).In the few instances when they did have relationships with the locals, they were almost always friendly, many said. Sometimes local children would visit their friends in the compound. There was a sense of camaraderie with them,  one woman said.Watch video here:There was a notable exception, a situation involving the local schools in the late 1990s when some of the Islamberg boys got into a scuffle with local boys. They broke my nephew s nose,  said a Hancock, N.Y., woman, who asked that her name not be used.Another man said the Muslim boys  trashed  the school in Deposit.Locals variously blamed the fighting on an angry attitude on the part of the Muslim boys, racism on the part of the local boys or the  usual  relatively trivial events that lead almost all teenage boys into a confrontation at one point or another in their lives.According to Joy Felber, 62, a retired taxidermist who s lived in Deposit for 19 years, the cause lay with a group of local boys who picked a fight with the Muslims. We had some young boys in town who were causing trouble   not from the Muslim community   but they were antagonizing the boys in the Muslim community,  Felber said.  It was lack of knowledge.

Very wrong!PAUL MANAFORT WIRETAPPED US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump. Some of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign, according to three sources familiar with the investigation. Two of these sources, however, cautioned that the evidence is not conclusive.Special counsel Robert Mueller s team, which is leading the investigation into Russia s involvement in the election, has been provided details of these communications.A secret order authorized by the court that handles the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) began after Manafort became the subject of an FBI investigation that began in 2014. It centered on work done by a group of Washington consulting firms for Ukraine s former ruling party, the sources told CNN. The surveillance was discontinued at some point last year for lack of evidence, according to one of the sources.The FBI then restarted the surveillance after obtaining a new FISA warrant that extended at least into early this year. Sources say the second warrant was part of the FBI s efforts to investigate ties between Trump campaign associates and suspected Russian operatives.

"Sep 19, 2016","Will this FINALLY be the straw that breaks the camel s back? Wow and it s not even October yet! Things are not looking good for #CrookedHillary The House Oversight Committee is reviewing a Reddit post that alleges an IT specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton s private server sought advice on how to alter the contents of  VERY VIP  emails, according to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.).Meadows is the chairman of the panel s Government Operations subcommittee. The Reddit post issue and its connection to Paul Combetta is currently being reviewed by OGR staff and evaluations are being made as to the authenticity of the post,  Meadows told The Hill. Reddit users appear to have uncovered a two-year-old post from an account believed to belong to Combetta, an engineer with Platte River Networks. The Denver, Colo.-based firm managed Clinton s private server.The Reddit Archives that are allegedly Combetta s, can be found near end of article. Combetta was granted immunity from Obama s Department of Justice in their investigation of Clinton.Combetta was the employee who deleted all of Hillary Clinton s emails.According users on Reddit, Combetta asked for assistance in July 2014 from Reddit users on how to purge emails and how to strip VIP s email address from  a bunch of archived emails.  -GPhttps://twitter.com/juliangwan/status/778006379596509184The post, which has been deleted but can be read in images archived by Reddit users, coincides with the discovery of Clinton s use of the server.Busted:Proof of Intent to Obstruct Justice 2 Years Ago from #HillarysHackerReddit Post Reveals. pic.twitter.com/aVgdV8gDla  The Truther (@4evertruther) September 19, 2016 I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email  Basically, they don t want the VIP s email address exposed to anyone, and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out,  reads the post, by a user called  stonetear.

If it is determined that the request to change email addresses was made by someone so closely aligned with the Secretary s IT operation as Mr. Combetta, then it will certainly prompt additional inquiry,  Meadows told The Hill.  The date of the Reddit post in relationship to the establishment of the Select Committee on Benghazi is also troubling. The Reddit message was sent on July 23, 2014, according to an archive of the page saved by other users. The day before, the Benghazi Committee had reached an agreement with the State Department on the production of related records, according the FBI s investigation into Clinton s use of the server.The identity of the  stonetear  user is not confirmed. Reddit users point to the fact that an account on the online marketplace Easy for a Paul Combetta has the username  stonetear  and the inactive website combetta.com is registered to the email address stonetear@gmail.com.Combetta appeared under subpoena in a committee hearing last week on the alleged destruction of evidence, but both he and colleague Bill Thornton exercised their Fifth Amendment right not to testify.borismkv: There is no supported way to do what you re asking. You can only delete emails after they re stored in the database. You can t change them. If there was a feature in Exchange that allowed this, it could result in major legal issues. There may be ways to hack a solution, but I am not aware of any. permalinkembedsavegive goldstonetear: As a PST file or exported MSG files, this could be done though, yes? The issue is that these emails involve the private email address of someone you d recognize, and we re trying to replace it with a placeholder address as to not expose it.exproject: To my knowledge, there s no way to edit existing messages, that s a possibility for a discovery nightmare. To strip/rename on outbound/inbound you could rewrite it with a transport rule.stonetear: That wouldn t work on existing messages though right?odoprasm: Is there no way to access and edb manually?stonetear: I have full access to the server   what are you suggesting with the EDB file?stonetear: I think maybe I wasn t clear enough in the original post. I have these emails available in a PST file. Can I rewrite them in the PST? I could also export to MSG and do some sort of batch find/replace. Anyone know of tools that might help with this?exproject: Just because you have the messages available in multiple formats and locations doesn t change that it s an attribute of the envelope not meant to be rewritten. The functionality is just not built into any tool I know of. Having that functionality would create the ability to screw with discovery (I mean, there could be mitigation with versioning, but that would need other configuration) While it may not be a read-only part of the envelope(I m not actually sure), the only tool that MIGHT be able to do what you want is MFCMapi, and I don t think you want to play with that for this job. The chance of getting it wrong would be pretty high I think and it is not a particularly friendly tool. I m not sure it could be scripted with it either. My recommendation would be what /u/borismkv said. Making a mailbox for VIP and telling them to use that. Forwarding to VIPs mailbox would be ripe for them to just respond directly instead of responding through his relay mailbox. As for your existing messages, if the current users absolutely cannot see the existing messages, you ll need to do a search and export and just forcibly remove the messages from their mailboxes. It s not clean and not advised by me, but if they don t want VIPs address out there it will need to be removed. I would do a search with his email address as the query with -LogOnly -LogLevel Full and see what kind of results you get.EDIT: Holy shit they actually deleted all their comments from a 2 year old reddit post, I think we hit gold on this one. Archive.is link of the deleted reddit postCan somebody make sure we have the twitter posts archived too? I really don t trust twitter to keep those up.  Gateway PunditHere is the ARCHIVE of the messages that were deleted on Reddit.UPDATE: Here s a screengrab of the archived pictures from Reddit:The committee has scheduled another hearing on the  preservation of State Department records  for Thursday.Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has issued a criminal referral asking the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to investigate deletions from the server.This latest probe stems from revelations from the 58-page report issued by the FBI summarizing its investigation into Clinton s use of the server.According to the FBI s report, an unnamed Platte River Networks technician deleted an archive of emails from the server in March 2015   after the House Select Committee on Benghazi had issued a subpoena for records relating to the 2012 attack on the Libyan outpost.According to the FBI s notes, longtime Clinton aide Cheryl Mills instructed Platte River Networks to delete a set of archived emails in December 2014. Mills told investigators Clinton had decided she no longer needed access to emails older than 60 days.But the technician apparently forgot the request and didn t immediately comply. According to the FBI report, between March 25 and March 31 of 2015, the technician  believed he had an  oh shit  moment and   deleted the Clinton archive mailbox from the [Platte River Networks] server. Reporting from The New York Times has since identified Combetta as that technician, citing an anonymous law enforcement official and others familiar with the FBI probe.Clinton and Mills told the FBI that they had no knowledge of the technician s deletion of the emails. The technician, according to the report,  was aware of the existence of the [Benghazi Committee] preservation request and the fact that it meant he should not disturb Clinton s email data on the [Platte River Networks] server.

"Sep 19, 2017","A speech for the ages was given today by President Donald Trump. He addressed the 72nd meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York for the first time in his presidency. The transcript is below.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, world leaders, and distinguished delegates: Welcome to New York. It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. The stock market is at an all-time high   a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time. And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.To put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear.This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Those three beautiful pillars   they re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity.The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time,  Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world.We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success.Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures, and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution   the oldest constitution still in use in the world today.This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity, and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity, and the rule of law.The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are:  We the people. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs.In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our government s first duty is to its people, to our citizens   to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values.As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. (Applause.)All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. But we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return. As long as I hold this office, I will defend America s interests above all else.But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it s in everyone s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations Charter. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall. America s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe to the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion, or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values.That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats, and even wars that we face. Or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today, so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.We were all witness to the regime s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictator s brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea s spies.If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles.The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. That s what the United Nations is all about; that s what the United Nations is for. Let s see how they do.It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. Thank you to all involved.But we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.We face this decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime   one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room.The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran s leaders are, in fact, its own people.Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors. This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad s dictatorship, fuel Yemen s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. (Applause.) The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don t think you ve heard the last of it   believe me.It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran s government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained. And above all, Iran s government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people, and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran s people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers.Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? Or will the Iranian people return to the nation s proud roots as a center of civilization, culture, and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again?The Iranian regime s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing.In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people.The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of ISIS. In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined.We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens   even innocent children   shock the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.We appreciate the efforts of United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process.For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach.For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries.For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform, and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms.For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.I want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Nigeria and Yemen.We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief; the President s Malaria Initiative; the Global Health Security Agenda; the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery; and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.We also thank   (applause)   we also thank the Secretary General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Too often the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process.In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council.The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.Major portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, militarily or financially. Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse.The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch.As a responsible neighbor and friend, we and all others have a goal. That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela. (Applause.)The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. (Applause.) From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action. All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules. And our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government: the duty of our citizens. This bond is the source of America s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the  independent strength of its members.  If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign, and independent nations   nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit.In remembering the great victory that led to this body s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved.Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain.Today, if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts, and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities, and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucrats   we can t do it. We must solve our problems, to build our prosperity, to secure our futures, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was  effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued, and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism.History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself.Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others, and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all: a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth.This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people, and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world: We will fight together, sacrifice together, and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity, and for the almighty God who made us all.Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.",‘One for the Ages’ Full Video and Transcript of Trump’s Incredible UN Speech [Video]

"Sep 20, 2017","Hello Jeff Sessions! Where is the DOJ s leader these days? Something tells us the Trump Dossier will end up being the bombshell that exposes Comey, Brennan and Clapper and all of the other criminals who used this dossier to spy on Trump. Obama used the dossier to spy on Trump!Anyone who followed the Obama White House intel policy outcomes will know that DNI Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan were the two primary political operatives weaponizing intelligence.But it gets better Comey comes into play:Remember the bombshell testimony of the Hermitage Capital CEO where the origin of the Fusion GPS  Russian Dossier  was discussed? CEO Browder stated the Russian government paid Fusion GPS to create the Steele propaganda dossier on candidate Donald Trump. That same dossier was used by the FBI in June/July 2016 to generate the FISA surveillance warrants against the Trump campaign. BOMBSHELL: Comey was using propaganda commissioned by Russia, funded in part by the FBI, to attack Trump, as the framework to launch his FBI investigation into candidate Donald Trump and Russian collusion.CEO BROWDER S ADMISSION BELOW:This is getting good.What does Nunes do now after several attempts at getting documents related to the dossier?After two previous deadlines came and went, House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes has set a new date for the FBI and Justice Department to turn over documents relating to the Trump dossier.Nunes originally subpoenaed the FBI and Justice on Aug. 24, demanding dossier documents by Sept. 1. When none were produced, Nunes agreed to extend the deadline to September 14. During that time, arrangements were made for intelligence committee investigators to visit the Justice Department to make sure officials on both sides understood precisely which documents the committee seeks.No documents were produced by Sept. 14, and now Nunes, apparently unsatisfied with the results of the staff meeting, has sent a new letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In it, Nunes set a deadline of this Friday for the documents to be produced. If the documents are not produced by then, Nunes directed that Wray and Sessions appear in an open committee hearing Sept. 28, to explain why they did not hand over the materials.The document request in the original Aug. 24 subpoena has not changed. It focuses on the FBI s relations with Christopher Steele, the former British spy retained by the American opposition research firm Fusion GPS to dig dirt on Donald Trump in Russia as part of an effort funded by wealthy supporters of Hillary Clinton. Among other things, the original subpoena demanded all internal FBI reports  incorporating, relying on, or referring to  information provided by Steele, his sources, or Fusion GPS.The original subpoena also asked for  any information, if it exists, provided by Mr. Steele as an informant/source (confidential or otherwise) or in any other capacity,  as well as any documents relating to whether the FBI paid or offered any benefits to Steele. The subpoena also asked for all documents relating to FBI and Justice  efforts to corroborate, validate, or evaluate  information provided by Steele.Finally, the original subpoena requested any court applications for surveillance that included any information provided by Steele, plus any court orders, if there were any, that were based in any part on Steele s information.So far, the FBI and Justice Department have not provided the information. Now, they have a new deadline.Read more: WE",FBI and DOJ Refusing To Comply With Subpoena Over Trump Dossier…Hello Jeff Sessions?

The shooting set off a long night of violent protests and Wednesday the demonstrations continued for a second night, starting off as a peaceful march through downtown Charlotte. But when the demonstrators neared an Omni Hotel, some people climbed the roof of an outdoor mall and started throwing objects at the crowd.Other people were banging on the doors of the hotel, and police in riot gear emerged in the entrance.His family said Scott, an African-American, was unarmed and sitting in his car reading a book, waiting for his son to come home from school.But Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Scott exited his car with a gun, not a book. He said officers couldn t find a book at the scene. It s time for the voiceless majority to stand up and be heard,  said the police chief, who is black.

"Sep 22, 2015","Oops! Hillary Clinton thought her server was wiped clean but it appears as though KARMA has arrived on the scene. The FBI has Clinton s e-mails! Maybe she ll finally be held accountable for Benghazi. This is going to get very interesting.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has successfully recovered personal and work emails from Hillary Clinton s private email server, according to a new report.Sources told Bloomberg News that some of Clinton s emails have been extracted from the server, thus disproving the claim that Clinton managed to wipe her server clean after she deleted all of her emails earlier this year.Therefore, some of the emails that Clinton deleted   the ones that she determined were NOT relevant to federal investigations   are now in the hands of the FBI.The federal investigation, therefore, is now out of Clinton s control.Outside computer specialists have said the FBI has the technical capability to recover deleted e-mails. The exact number of personal e-mails recovered by the FBI could not be learned. Once the e-mails have been extracted, a group of agents has been separating personal correspondence and passing along work-related messages to agents leading the investigation, the person said. Since the existence of the e-mail system became public in March, Clinton has seen her standing in polls slide, particularly in regards to questions about her trustworthiness. She also has been heavily criticized by congressional Republicans who have raised questions over whether the private server jeopardized the security of sensitive data. Internal government watchdogs have determined that classified information ended up on the system. Their findings sparked the FBI inquiry.Read more: Bloomberg News ",BREAKING: Hillary Clinton’s Deleted E-mails Found By FBI On Her Server

A BUNCH OF WHITE GUYS . WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR Obama urged computing companies to invest in and hire more women and people of color  Changing that composition, Obama said, will take encouraging girls at a young age to study science and math. It will mean bridging  the technology gap  that persists in low-income districts. It requires revisions to the public-school system. And it warrants forming hiring committees with more women and people of color.  You can t just say you want to fix the problems, you have to mean it,  Obama said.  If a bunch of white guys are sitting around the table trying to get more women involved, they re not going to come up with the answer.  For Utah s Silicon Slopes and elsewhere, she added, a behavioral change in the office environment at IT corporations will need to accompany that shift. You can t hire women and then they come in and they re working for chimps. No offense   you guys aren t all chimps,  Obama said to laughs from the crowd.  I call my husband a chimp sometimes, especially when he s watching the Sports Center. I m like  Come on. Look at you. You re an animal. CLINTON JAB?

Pope Francis paid a short visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor community in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday to support them in their court case over the contraception mandate, the Vatican s spokesman revealed.It was a  short visit that was not in the program,  Father Federico Lombardi, director of the Holy See Press Office, said at an evening press conference during the papal visit to the nation s capital. This is a sign, obviously, of support for them  in their court case, he affirmed.The sisters have filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration for its 2012 mandate that employers provide insurance coverage for birth control, sterilizations, and drugs that can cause abortions in employee health plans. The sisters have maintained that to provide this coverage would violate their religious beliefs.Even after the Obama administration modified the rules as an  accommodation  for objecting organizations, the sisters held that the revised rules would force them to violate their consciences.The majority of a three-judge panel for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in July that the Little Sisters of the Poor did not establish that the mandate was a  substantial burden  on their free exercise of religion, and thus ruled they still had to abide by the mandate.The papal visit was not on the official schedule for Pope Francis  Washington, D.C. visit, which included Wednesday visits to the White House, a midday prayer service with the U.S. bishops at St. Matthew s Cathedral, and the canonization mass for St. Junipero Serra at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.It was a  little addition to the program, but I think it has an important meaning,  Fr. Lombardi said.He added that the visit  is connected  to  the words that the Pope has said in support of the position of the bishops of the United States in the speech to President Obama and also in the speech to the bishops. Pope Francis, with President Obama at the White House, called religious freedom  one of America s most precious possessions  and had hearkened to the U.S. bishops  defense of religious freedom.  All are called to be vigilant, precisely as good citizens, to preserve and defend that freedom from everything that would threaten or compromise it,  he had said.In response to the news of the visit with the sisters, Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville, president of the U.S. Bishops Conference, said that he was  so pleased  to hear of the visit. As you know the last thing the Little Sisters of the Poor want to do is sue somebody. They don t want to sue in court,  he insisted.  They simply want to serve people who are poor and elderly, and they want to do it in a way that doesn t conflict with their beliefs.Via: Catholic News Agency",POPE MAKES VISIT TO NUNS OBAMA REGIME IS SUING For Not Conforming To Obamacare Contraception Mandate

"Sep 26, 2016","Who won the debate tonight? Donald J. Trump or the Lester Holt-Clinton team?NBC News  Lester Holt had his  Candy Crowley  moment at the first debate of the 2016 presidential election on Monday night, bowing to pressure from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the liberal media by  fact-checking  Republican nominee Donald Trump on the question of his support for the Iraq War.Holt lived up to the expectations of his peers. But he lived down to the worst expectations of conservatives, who routinely see Republican candidates treated unfairly by debate moderators.Hillary also went over the 2 minute mark several times, while there were several times when Lester Holt would cut Donald Trump off after only having a little over a minute to answer a question. Again and again, Holt asked Trump tough questions that were straight from the Clinton campaign s talking points, and which were obvious set-ups for Clinton to attack (and for fact-checkers to pounce on whatever Trump asserted in his own defense).Here are the five worst examples.Tax returns. Holt never asked Clinton about her e-mail scandal, about Benghazi, or about the Clinton Foundation and its dubious dealings. But he did ask Trump about his tax returns, arguing   not asking   that there might be questionable information in them that the American public deserved to hear.Birther conspiracy theory. Holt never asked Clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her  super-predator  remarks as First Lady, or her explicit appeal to  white Americans  in her 2008 primary campaign against Obama. Yet he asked Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist.Stop-and-frisk. After an exchange between the candidates over the policy of  stop-and-frisk,  Holt interjected to bolster Clinton s point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in New York because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. Trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over. A presidential look.  Towards the end of the debate, Holt asked Trump about what he meant by saying Hillary Clinton did not have  a presidential look.  He did so after noting that Clinton had become  the first woman  to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting Trump up as a sexist. As Trump answered, Holt interrupted him, then gave Clinton a chance to respond with her talking points about Trump s past comments on women.Iraq War. The question of whether Trump supported the Iraq War or not has been widely debated. What is beyond doubt is that Hillary Clinton voted for it. Holt only represented one side of the debate about Trump, and never asked Clinton about her own vote.

This latest news just adds insult to injury A Syrian rebel commander who recently completed a U.S. training program has told the U.S. military that he surrendered six coalition-provided trucks and ammunition to an intermediary linked to the al-Qaida affiliate in Syria, known as the Nusra Front. U.S. Central Command said late Friday that roughly 25 percent of the equipment assigned to that unit was apparently turned over earlier this week in exchange for safe passage within the region.U.S. officials said the Syrians continue to insist that they have not relinquished any actual weapons to the Nusra Front and that all of their personnel are still accounted for.Air Force Col. Pat Ryder, a U.S. Central Command spokesman, said the command is looking into the incident.But the report contradicts information the Defense Department provided earlier in the day, which said reports of U.S.-trained Syrian rebels defecting and missing equipment going to the Nusra Front were incorrect.The report underscores persistent problems with the U.S.-led coalition s effort to train and equip Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State.Ryder said the Syrians had told the U.S. earlier Friday that no equipment or people were missing, but the U.S. found out later on that some of those assertions were wrong.He said providing equipment to the Nusra Front is a violation of the training and equipping program. In light of this new information, we wanted to ensure the public was informed as quickly as possible about the facts as we know them at this time,  Ryder said.

"Sep 27, 2017","Rumors continue to swirl around West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin who told voters during a Facebook live Q & A that he thinks NFL owners should step in and tell players protesting during the national anthem they won t tolerate it. The Democrat Senator has been brushing off talk that he s switching parties to become a Republican. He often agrees with the Republican party and has recently commented that he doesn t  give a sh*t  if he s reelected. Manchin came down on the side of the president in the NFL controversy and had some heartfelt comments about why he stands for our anthem. He called on the NFL owners to address the disrespect in kneeling during the anthem:SENATOR JOE MANCHIN:  This is something the owners have to address. The owners of these football teams, that have these contracts with these players and the conditions these players are going to be playing under, has to step in here and say, I m not going to tolerate it. The only thing that you and I can do right now is turn off the TV if you don t want to watch, don t go to the game if that s a team you don t respect for whatever reason. I think everyone should stand and show respect for the flag that represents the greatest nation on earth that s shed more blood and lost more lives for the cause of freedom that you and I enjoy. HEARTFELT COMMENTS ON  THE RIGHT THING TO DO Senator Manchin spoke about why he believes this is the  right thing to do :  When I was a young person it was just taught to me that was the right thing to do. When I got older and I realized all the sacrifices that were made for me people that went to war, people that didn t return when I realized all of that, I said that s my patriotic duty that I can say thank you for the flag that represents the greatest country on earth.

"Sep 29, 2015","Is the Pope s defense of same sex marriage the straw the will break the camel s back for the godless left? Washington, DC   Media is buzzing about the Pope s comments in support of conscientious objection and whether he knows about the Rowan County, Kentucky, Clerk of Court who was jailed for six days for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The Pope met privately with Kim Davis and her husband, Joe, at the Vatican Embassy in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, September 24, which was the birthday of Kim s father. Pope Francis spoke with Kim and Joe Davis in English.During the meeting Pope Francis said,  Thank you for your courage.  Pope Francis also told Kim Davis to  Stay strong.  He held out his hands and asked Kim to pray for him. Kim held his hands and said,  I will. Please pray for me,  and the Pope said he would. The two embraced. The Pontiff presented Kim and Joe Davis each with a Rosary that he personally blessed. Kim s mother and father are Catholic, and Kim and Joe will present the Rosaries to her parents. Kim s mother was the elected Clerk of Court for Rowan County for 37 years until her retirement in 2014.Kim Davis said,  I was humbled to meet Pope Francis. Of all people, why me?  Davis continued,  I never thought I would meet the Pope. Who am I to have this rare opportunity? I am just a County Clerk who loves Jesus and desires with all my heart to serve him.  Kim said,  Pope Francis was kind, genuinely caring, and very personable. He even asked me to pray for him. Pope Francis thanked me for my courage and told me to  stay strong. The challenges we face in America regarding the sanctity of human life, marriage, and religious freedom are the same universal challenges Christians face around the world. Religious freedom is a human right that comes from God. These values are shared in common by people of faith, and the threats to religious freedom are universal. Kim Davis has become a symbol of this worldwide conflict between Christian faith and recent cultural challenges regarding marriage,  said Mat Staver, Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel.Speaking with reporters on board the Papal plane to Rome, Pope Francis told Terry Moran of ABC News that conscientious objection is a human right, even for government officials:  Conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right. It is a right. And if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector, he denies a right. Conscientious objection must enter into every juridical structure because it is a right, a human right. Otherwise we would end up in a situation where we select what is a right, saying  this right that has merit, this one does not.  It (conscientious objection) is a human right. It always moved me when I read, and I read it many times, when I read the  Chanson de Roland  when the people were all in line and before them was the baptismal font and they had to choose between the baptismal font or the sword. They had to choose. They weren t permitted conscientious objection. It is a right and if we want to make peace we have to respect all rights. The ABC News Chief Foreign Correspondent asked if that includes government officials as well, and the Pope reiterated that conscientious objection is a human right:  It is a human right and if a government official is a human person, he has that right,  Pope Francis affirmed.After the above statement of Pope Francis was published, some in the media wondered if the Pontiff knew of Kim Davis.  Not only did Pope Francis know of Kim Davis, he personally met with her to express his support,  concluded Staver.Via: Barbed Wire","BREAKING: Pope Met Privately With Enemy Of Left, Kim Davis"

"Sep 30, 2015","Remember the report that came out after Hillary left her position as Secretary of State? There was missing money $6 billion couldn t be accounted for. How does $6 billion just vanish? It seems like this is the usual thing with the Clintons. The Clinton Global Foundation also was missing money. Yes, a whopping $17 million went missing! I think we have a couple of Arkansas Grifters on our hands Since Bill and Hillary Clinton left the White House in 2001, they have earned more than $230 million. But in federal filings the Clintons claim they are worth somewhere between $11 million and $53 million. After layering years of disclosures on top of annual tax returns, Forbes estimates their combined net worth at $45 million. Where did all of the money go? No one seems to know, and the Clintons aren t offering any answers.From 2001 to 2014 the power couple spent $95 million on taxes. Hillary s 2008 presidential run cost her $13 million. Their two homes cost a combined $5 million, and the Clintons have given away $22 million to charity. All of this is according to FEC filings, property records and years of tax returns. Add it up and you get $135 million. If the Clintons made $230 million, spent $135 million and have just $45 million left over, what happened to the other $50 million? That s kind of strange,  says Joe Biden s accountant, Walter Deyhle.  You have to report all of your assets. You have to report assets that are owned by your spouse. It seems unlikely that the Clintons could have spent all of it. Over 14 years $50 million averages out to $3.6 million in extra expenses per year, or $9,800 per day. Read the rest:Forbes explores some possible explanations for the missing money but dares not touch on one likely possibility  that when you re running a criminal enterprise the size and scope of the Clinton Foundation, there are many, many people whose silence must be bought, and such folks don t come cheap.It s also possible that Bill s sexual shenanigans have resulted in out-of-court settlements in exchange for confidentiality agreements.And of course, political influence can be a two way street. While we assume that foreign entities have paid vast sums to the Clintons in exchange for favors, the Clintons themselves may have had to shell out money in exchange for access.

Here s EXHIBIT 1 on just how far she ll go While speaking to a group of donors last February, Hillary mocked Bernie Sanders supporters and admitted the  free college  and  free healthcare are just a ploy to win the votes of millennials The Intercept had this to say about Clinton s flip flopping:Clinton has been inconsistent in the past about espousing political labels. She has at times touted herself as stalwart liberal. For instance, she said last July:  I take a backseat to no one when you look at my record in standing up and fighting for progressive values.  But a few months later, she told a group in Ohio:  You know, I get accused of being kind of moderate and center. I plead guilty. AUDIO OF CLINTON MOCKING BERNIE SUPPORTERSCLINTON: Some are new to politics completely. They re children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents  basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don t see much of a future. I met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said,  You know, none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college. And we don t believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance.  So that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics. And so if you re feeling like you re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn t pay a lot, and doesn t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. So I think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be, you know, a wet blanket on idealism. We want people to be idealistic.

It turns out, you re really just voting for another Barack Obama without the race card to fall back on or Hillary without the criminal background Libertarians should be allergic to power grabs by the executive for the obvious reason that they lend themselves to concentrated authority and (usually) bigger government. If you want to slow the state down, a robust, sharply divided Congress that jealously guards its constitutional prerogatives from the president should be your ideal   even in cases where the executive happens to be acting towards an end you deem salutary. In this year of all years, admirers of Obama s various forms of overreach should be thinking hard about how President Trump might build on his precedents. To a constitutionalist, which most mainstream libertarians claim to be, all of this is second nature.Is Gary Johnson a constitutionalist?THRUSH: How about Obama s executive order, which was decried as being a great constitutional violation by the Republicans, Obama s executive order on immigration. Did you consider that to be a violation or did you consider that a reasonable use of targeted executive power?MR. JOHNSON: I saw it as a reasonable use, challenging Congress to action. And an untold story with regard to Obama and immigration is he s broken up 3 million families. He has deported 3 million heads of households that have gone back to Mexico and their families have remained in the United States.If Obama issued an executive order to the IRS demanding that they collect 10 percent more in tax from individuals than the Internal Revenue Code provides, would Johnson deem that legal? What if the order instructed the agency to collect 10 percent less tax? Would his opinion of its legality change? Because it shouldn t. Bear in mind, Obama s 2014  DAPA  amnesty has already been blocked by a preliminary injunction that was upheld on review by the Fifth Circuit so Johnson had plenty of legal cover here to say that he s troubled by Obama s procedural approach despite the fact that he happens to agree with the policy ends. Instead he seems to endorse the bizarre legal theory pushed by some leftists that if Congress isn t moving quickly enough for the president s taste in enacting a policy he supports, he can go ahead and  challenge  them by enacting it himself and leaving it to Congress to overrule him if they feel strongly to the contrary.

They pay over $2 billion in taxes Is anyone else out there sick of the American people being told illegals cost nothing?DACA Will Cost Americans And Their Government A Huge Amount of Money.On average, people with college degrees pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. People without a degree consume more taxes than they pay to federal, state and local tax officials.In 2013, a Heritage Foundation study showed that amnesty for 11 million illegals would spike federal spending by $6,300 billion over the next five decades. That is roughly equivalent to $550,000 per illegal, or $10,000 per illegal per year, much of which will be spent when the immigrant becomes eligible for Social Security and Medicare. That cost estimate does not include the extra costs created when immigrants use their new legal powers as a citizen to bring in more low-skilled migrants.If those 3 million DACA people and their parents soon become legal residents or citizens, then Obama s DACA will cost Americans roughly $1,700 billion over the next 50 years, according to Heritage Foundation s numbers.Moreover, the DACA migrants add to the flood of illegal labor that has driven down wages for ordinary Americans, including urban youths and recent immigrants. Currently, Americans lose roughly $500 billion a year from their salaries because of the immigration tax caused by cheap labor according to the academies  report.Via: GP","Trump ‘Diversity Council’ Member Threatens to Quit If Trump Ends DACA…Bye, Bye!

"Sep 5, 2016","After a lifetime of passionate conservative activism and the creation of a very successful activist organization, it s heartbreaking that Schlafly died before she could see the man she risked so much for win the election. Conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly died on Monday afternoon. The  Sweetheart of the Silent Majority  passed away surrounded by family in her home in Ladue, Missouri just a short 10-minute drive from where she was born in St. Louis on August 15, 1924.Her death marks a palpable loss for the conservative movement which, just last month, celebrated the grassroots heroine s 92nd birthday.An accomplished lawyer, activist, author, and mother of six, Phyllis Schlafly has been described as the embodiment of the ideal American woman.As Sen. Jeff Sessions wrote in a statement submitted for the Congressional Record,  dynamic, smart, beautiful, and articulate,  Schlafly has  fearlessly  and  tirelessly  championed the American family and American values. In 1963, the publisher of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat put it this way:  Phyllis Schlafly stands for everything that has made America great and for those things which will keep it that way. Schlafly enjoyed a rich family life. Married in 1949, she and her late-husband, Fred, shared forty-four happy years together as well as six children, sixteen grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.Never one to see her femininity as antithetical to her career goals, Schlafly was awarded Illinois  Mother of the Year only a few years before being named one of the 100 Most Important Women of the 20th Century by the Ladies  Home Journal.Revered for her steadfast judgement, Schlafly was a guiding light to many conservatives, who looked to her to determine the political battles of the day. Most recently, the  godmother of the conservative movement  led the charge against the Gang of Eight amnesty plan and President Obama s Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement.Unafraid to go toe-to-toe with some of the most powerful men in the nation, Schlafly was known for engaging in fights of principle all while projecting her irresistible charm, grace and wit.Schlafly understood feminism not as an effort to erase or wipe away the unique, distinguishing features of women, but rather to embrace and encourage all of the special and wondrous things about womanhood. Whereas modern feminism teaches that a little girl is not so different from a little boy and that society should recognize no real difference between the two, Schlafly celebrated motherhood and femininity, and perceived the differences amongst the sexes as something to be extolled rather than repressed.A vocal proponent for empowering all Americans, Schlafly fought tirelessly against the social institutions that teach the  absolutely false  narrative that  women are victims of the patriarchy and [that] it s up to new laws in the Constitution to remedy this second-class citizenship of women. American women are the most fortunate class of people who ever lived on the face of the earth,  Schlafly proclaimed in 2012.  We can do anything we want to do. Schlafly s life was truly a testament to what she preached. A child of Great Depression, she paid her way through college by putting in 48-hour work weeks as a gunner testing ammunition at the largest ammunition plant in the world, the St. Louis Ordnance Plant. Schlafly tested .30 and .50 caliber ammunition for accuracy, penetration, velocity, and aircraft function before the government would accept the ammunition for the war effort during World War II. Despite the rigors of a full-time job working the midnight to 8am shift at the ordnance plant, Schlafly still managed to finish her schooling in just three years, graduating from Washington University in St. Louis Phi Beta Kappa.She then went on to get her master s degree in Government from Harvard University in 1945, and her J.D. from Washington University Law School in 1978.Schlafly was active in politics for more than one-quarter of all American history.She began volunteering for the Republican Party in 1945 when she worked as a campaign manager for Claude Bakewell, a successful Republican candidate for Congress. Schlafly attended every single Republican National Convention since 1952 and has been at the center of nearly every major political battle since then.Beginning in the 1950s and 60s, Schlafly was instrumental in helping to launch the anti-Communist movement by forming 5,000 study groups throughout American homes to inform grassroots voters about the evils of Communism.As an activist, Schlafly seemed driven by her mission to  educate [conservatives], train them, and stand up for them  [and to] let the grassroots be heard. An advocate for truth and the free dissemination of information, Schlafly spoke frequently of the need for  news people who put out the truth instead of the packaged truth that the strategists have written.   Breitbart91-year-old Phyllis Schlafly was in the fight of her life against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) supporters within her organization. Schlafly appeared in court to fight to retain control of her legacy and the organization she founded over 40 years ago.Watch Phyllis bravely endorse Donald Trump at his St. Louis rally in March, 2016:https://youtu.be/2qfCQ4riXO0The grassroots heroine and conservative icon appeared in Madison County, Illinois to defend her organization, Eagle Forum, against those inside her organization who are attempting a coup.As Breitbart News has previously reported, the internal strife within Eagle Forum is connected to Schlafly s decision to endorse GOP frontrunner Donald Trump over Texas Senator Ted Cruz. When explaining her support for Trump, Schlafly cited Trump s strong positions on promoting pro-America trade policies, curbing immigration, and defending national sovereignty   issues which are very important to Schlafly.The suit was filed by Schlafly s own daughter, Anne Schlafly Cori, and four other Cruz supporters within Schlafly s organization: Eunie Smith, Cathie Adams, Carolyn McLarty, and Rosina Kovar. Shirley Curry, the only other member of the so-called  Gang of Six  who is a plaintiff in this case, has not taken a public position on the presidential race.","92 YR OLD CONSERVATIVE ICON DIES: Only 4 Months Ago Her Daughter, 5 Cruz Supporters Tried To Fire Her From Organization She Founded For Supporting Trump"

"Sep 6, 2016","You know the Left has won when communism replaces education A freshman tentatively raises her hand and takes the microphone.  I m really scared to ask this,  she begins.  When I, as a white female, listen to music that uses the N word, and I m in the car, or, especially when I m with all white friends, is it O.K. to sing along? The answer, from Sheree Marlowe, the new chief diversity officer at Clark University, is an unequivocal  no. The exchange was included in Ms. Marlowe s presentation to recently arriving first-year students focusing on subtle  microaggressions,  part of a new campus vocabulary that also includes  safe spaces  and  trigger warnings. Microaggressions, Ms. Marlowe said, are comments, snubs or insults that communicate derogatory or negative messages that might not be intended to cause harm but are targeted at people based on their membership in a marginalized group.Among her other tips: Don t ask an Asian student you don t know for help on your math homework or randomly ask a black student if he plays basketball. Both questions make assumptions based on stereotypes. And don t say  you guys.  It could be interpreted as leaving out women, said Ms. Marlowe, who realized it was offensive only when someone confronted her for saying it during a presentation.Clark, a private liberal arts college that has long prided itself on diversity and inclusion, is far from the only university stepping up discussions of racism and diversity in orientation programs this year.Once devoted to ice cream socials, tutorials on campus technology systems and advice on choosing classes, orientation for new students is changing significantly, with the issue taking on renewed urgency this year as universities increasingly try to address recent racial and ethnic tensions on campuses as well as an onslaught of sexual assault complaints and investigations.A bystander intervention presentation for arriving freshmen at Wesleyan University last Thursday    We Speak We Stand    featured students acting out fictional episodes of campus sexual violence, harassment and problematic drinking, with examples of how to intervene.  Each of you has the power to bring to light sexual violence in our community,  one student told the group.In August, the University of Wisconsin system, which includes the Madison flagship and 25 other campuses, said it would ask the State Legislature for $6 million in funding to improve what it called the  university experience  for students. The request includes money for Fluent, a program described as a systemwide cultural training for faculty and staff members and students.But that budget request has provoked controversy.  If only the taxpayers and tuition-paying families had a safe space that might protect them from wasteful UW System spending on political correctness,  State Senator Stephen L. Nass, a Republican, said in a statement issued by his office, urging his fellow lawmakers to vote against the appropriation.Mr. Nass s objection to spending money on diversity training reflects a rising resistance to what is considered campus political correctness. At some universities, alumni and students have objected to a variety of campus measures, including diversity training;  safe spaces,  places where students from marginalized groups can gather to discuss their experiences; and  trigger warnings,  disclaimers about possibly upsetting material in lesson plans.Some graduates have curtailed donations and students have suggested that diversity training smacks of some sort of communist re-education program. -Via NYT s",FRESHMAN ORIENTATION: It’s Racist To Ask Asian Students For Math Help…Don’t Ask Black Students If They Play Basketball…And MORE Insanity You Won’t Believe!

"Sep 7, 2015","This is a perfect example of how the left is able to decide which laws they follow and which laws the rest of America follows Kim Davis, the Democrat Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses because of religious objections, was ordered to jail for contempt of court last Thursday. She suggested a compromise of removing her name from the licenses, but Federal District Court Judge David Bunning wouldn t even grant that reasonable compromise.Contrast this with Cathy Lanier, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, refusing to issue concealed weapons permits to people unless they can arbitrarily show a  good reason,  nothing required by law. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in May stopping her from denying the permits, although notably he did not send Lanier to jail for contempt.Similarly, county sheriffs in California had been denying concealed weapons permits to applicants who failed to show a need beyond self-defense. Last November, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the sheriffs were violating the law. None of those sheriffs were sent to jail, despite the fact that people around the country have died unable to obtain a permit to carry concealed.Or contrast it with the irony of San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordering clerks to issue same-sex marriage licenses in 2004, contrary to state law. The California Attorney General sued him and the California Supreme Court ultimately put an end to the practice, but Newsom was never sent to jail.Newsom also violated federal law by making San Francisco a sanctuary city in 2007, contrary to existing federal law, but nothing happened to him. The city s sanctuary status resulted in the death of Kate Steinle in July, who was shot by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times and had seven felony convictions. This is a far more drastic result than a clerk who merely does not want her name on marriage licenses, yet nothing is being done to the current mayor of San Francisco, Ed Lee. In 2012, Tonya Parker, a lesbian judge in Texas said she would not issue marriage licenses to heterosexual couples until same-sex marriage was legalized. She wasn t put in jail for violating the law, nor does it appear she was even disciplined at all.Not everyone would have taken the position Davis did, some Christians might have resigned rather than deal with a huge battle. Others might not have had such strong objections, viewing matters of sexuality best left alone and without government interference. When I was an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Arizona, I represented agencies like the Arizona Commission on the Arts. Philosophically, I disagreed with its very existence. But I was able to separate my personal views from government laws to perform my job.The one thing all reasonable people can agree upon is that Davis was singled out and punished disproportionately compared to other public officials who didn t comply with controversial laws.This isn t about same-sex marriage, nor is it even about gay issues. It is merely one tactic in a larger goal to remove Christianity from the public sphere. There are reasonable compromises that could have been made between those Christians with conscientious objections and the LGBT community   plenty of gays consider themselves Christians   but the left is deliberately pushing for maximum conflict between the two groups in order to push one out of society.An Oregon judge announced on Friday that he will not perform same-sex marriages. Unlike the lesbian judge who said she would not perform heterosexual marriages, Judge Vance Day was immediately put under an ethics investigation by the Oregon Commission of Judicial Fitness and Disability, which plans to hold a hearing in November.This won t end with public employment. As the public sphere goes, so goes the private sphere. If companies balk, anti-discrimination laws can be used to force them to comply. The left intends to stamp religion out of society, until Christians are left secretly worshiping in their homes, hiding their status outside of the home. This is because the left fundamentally disagrees with Judeo-Christian ethics, which contradict its foundation of anything goes.Until conservatives wake up and start realizing the judicial branch, controlled by the left, has become the most lethal branch, the biggest threat of the three branches to our country and freedom, it will continue abusing the legal system to stamp out conservatism and religion from society.

"Sep 7, 2016","Make America Conservative again. There really isn t any downside It might be time to rethink the millennial voter.A new paper suggests that Americans are more politically polarized now than they ve been in the past 46 years, and millennials are guiding this trend.The young adults, who were born between 1980 and 1994, are currently more politically polarized than Generation Xers and Baby Boomers, according to the paper, which was published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin on Wednesday. Additionally, millennials are more likely to identify as conservative than either Generation Xers or Baby Boomers were at the same age, said Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University and lead author of the paper. High school seniors are more likely to identify as political conservatives now compared to 10 years ago. Most surprising, more identify as conservatives now compared to the 1980s, presumably the era of the young conservative, such as the character Alex P. Keaton in the 1980s show  Family Ties.  That goes against the common view of millennials as very liberal,  said Twenge, author of the book about millennials titled  Generation Me. So the current view of millennials as liberals might be due to their age   young people are more likely to be liberal. But if you compare young people now to young people in previous decades, those now are more conservative,  she said.The data showed that, as entering college students, 23% of millennials identified as leaning far right, compared to 17% of Baby Boomers and 22% of Generation Xers.Less than half   47%   of millennials identified as  middle-of-the-road,  compared to 50% of Baby Boomers and more than half   53%   of Generation Xers.Millennials have surpassed Baby Boomers both as the United States  largest living generation and as the largest generation in the American electorate.
